t3_66c5sr	t1_dghbdh1	1492628384	Trying getting onto a plane and realizing you only have your lightning earpods and can't watch a movie because they use the regular headphone jacks in the seats........  Did that twice before I started carrying an older pair with me.. That's how it should work, right Apple?	TheJerdle	t3_66c5sr
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghbhq9	1492628503	Yep, that's another thing too. You either have to carry the adapter everywhere and use standard headphones. Or you have to carry two pairs of headphones.  It's very frustrating and reminds me of the days when every phone manufacturer had their own charger. You couldn't charge your phone at your friend's house because he has an LG and you've got a Nokia.  This brings up another important topic. If I buy Airpods, I can no longer use them on a plane, public computer, or a friend's phone.	jeterlancer	t1_dghbdh1
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghbwbw	1492628923	FWIW, AirPods, like any other Bluetooth earphones, will work with any other computer or phone using Bluetooth. You *could* pair them to your friend's phone, then unpair them.  Or, in the case of on-ear wireless headphones (like the Beats Solo 3, Bose QC35s), there's often a standard headphone cable with 3.5mm jack in the box you could use for such situations.	redavid	t1_dghbhq9
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghbyp1	1492628990	Just tie the converter to your headphones with like a rubberband or something.	Cyberbeni	t3_66c5sr
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghbzki	1492629017	Yeah I've had a very similar experience. I'm not a big music person or audiophile, but even I see the problems with wireless. I love apple, but they are just dead wrong about BT for the time being. Until bluetooth sounds as good and works as well as the traditional headphone jack, you can't stand on stage and call it *outdated* and *old*. The new Bluetooth 5.0 is a step in the right direction, but it still isn't perfect, and if you're using high end equipment it isn't even remotely close to this *old* wire lol  anyways, that's just my opinion. I am excited for the day wireless comes with no compromises, today is not the day. 2017 will not be the year.	dackwarbs	t3_66c5sr
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghd6a8	1492630223	People seem to forget that floppy disks were also once the standard and guess what? They just worked. And then one day when hard drives became a thing and everything was transitioning over everyone was complaining, the same exact way that people are now over the lack of a 3.5mm jack. This is that same transition period of everything going wireless and there are still people using that old method of how things are done. It's simple: if you need a 3.5mm jack, then get a phone with one. No one is forcing you to upgrade and lose your port.	PM_Me_Your_Tabs	t1_dghb5u0
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghec3e	1492631397	fucking *thank you*.  i was puzzled when they dropped the headphone jack as well, but do people really think the world's most valuable tech company, which employs some of the most brilliant engineers, developers, and marketing executives in the field, hadn't already weighed the pros and cons of the decision? they've probably mulled over potential outcomes we haven't even thought of.  i get that it's inconvenient now, but let's not pretend we schmucks on the internet know the industry better than a company that's been at the forefront of it for a collective 20+ years.	swissarmybriefs	t1_dghd6a8
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghfx3l	1492633016	Both of you are so right. Threads like this drive me fucking bananas.	huskiesHTT	t1_dghec3e
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghg2no	1492633176	Apple knew there would be people that didn't like this move, that's the whole reason there's a lightning to headphone jack in the box of every 7 and 7 plus. They could have quite easily said: "fuck you, go buy one yourself" or just force you to go straight wireless. That small niche of people who want to charge and use headphones at the same time are just that, a small niche. I understand they took a feature from a phone but they still give you something for free that gives you back that functionality and give you stereo speakers as well.	PM_Me_Your_Tabs	t1_dghefgo
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghgnqi	1492633780	oh, did i say they were infallible? i don't believe i did. sounds like you jumped to a reckless conclusion based on hearing what you wanted to hear. i mean we only have Apple's 20-year track record for setting industry trends to prove me completely right, as well as the fact that people complained this same way when floppy disks and CD drives went out to pasture, but nah, facts and history are meaningless and your own skewed judgment is enough of a platform for you to put words in my mouth.  are you sure you're not Catholic?	swissarmybriefs	t1_dghgdnk
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghgnzd	1492633787	But it's still a solution? Some tiny dongle honestly isn't bad, at that point you're just looking for something to bitch about.	PM_Me_Your_Tabs	t1_dghgfcr
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghgvms	1492634009	Floppy disks stuck around longer than I thought they would. I remember using them in middle school in 1999 and 2000.  But you're forgetting one important piece though. Hard drives, flash drives, and CD-Roms were readily available as a replacement. What's the replacement for a headphone jack? Proprietary Airpods, or a handful of wireless earbuds that will only work with some of your accessories.  I just don't think the market was and is ready for going all wireless.  And Apple didn't even do it for the right reason. They did it because they needed the space for the new haptic feedback sensor.	jeterlancer	t1_dghd6a8
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghhjt9	1492634692	Currently the market isn't that prepared for wireless earbuds and the like because of battery limitations, but as time goes on they're going to become more and more common. While there aren't many options out for bluetooth earbuds, for the most part they are pretty high quality. Sony, Jaybird, Bose, even Razer all have some pretty high quality earbuds out. They cost quite a bit but all new technology does.	PM_Me_Your_Tabs	t1_dghgvms
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghi6yo	1492635352	it's Mormon of me to think the people who actually work for the company know more than a bunch of us geeks on reddit? huh. i wasn't aware Mormons were known for their common sense, so i guess i'll take that as a compliment.  nothing else i said is untrue either. they *are* the most valuable company in the world, you can google that shit bro. do you think they got there by hiring morons?  &gt; My opinion that they screwed up eliminating the headphone jack is just as valid as yours.  your *opinion* that they screwed up is perfectly valid, but "opinion" is still the operative word and, unfortunately, the facts (see also: sales figures) say your opinion is misinformed.	swissarmybriefs	t1_dghhbsu
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghi89u	1492635390	Right, which is exactly why this was a bad time for Apple to remove the headphone jack.  It would be like the EPA banning all gasoline cars. We just aren't ready for all electric yet.	jeterlancer	t1_dghhjt9
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghid91	1492635538	I also recently bought an iPhone 7 and am wanting to purchase a set of better headphones.    If I purchase a set of lightning headphones, then I can only use them with iPhones and not with my MacBook Pro, since there is no lightning to USB adapter.    If I purchase wireless headphones, these will work with both my iPhone and mac. However, I'm paying more money for inferior sound quality.    It seems like Apple really didn't think this one through.	crazyk4952	t3_66c5sr

But now you've got lightning headphones that won't work on the desktops and laptops, regular headphones that won't work on the newest iPhones, and wireless headphones that only work with certain products.	jeterlancer	t1_dghid91

t3_66c5sr	t1_dghjd8a	1492636665	&gt;How can I use Airpods on my Macbook if the iPhone is sitting right on the desk beside me?

t3_66c5sr	t1_dghjycz	1492637347	It's like asking someone with a lamborghini why they don't drive it every day. Well that might not be the best analogy..my point is, it's very easy to whip a phone out and listen to music. The performance is good enough, and the ease of use is even better. Good ratio. With bluetooth you have a large loss in performance but only slight gain in ease of use. Like I said it's not the end of the world, it's just a tradeoff I don't want to make.	dackwarbs	t1_dghikdg
t3_66c5sr	t1_dghl2cl	1492638647	Same here. It's fine if all the conditions are right in the world...but with a regular pair of headphones - if I want to let my brother use them I just hand them over. With bluetooth I have to pair and un-pair. Oh wait, crap I am in the passenger seat of a car that I have bluetooth connection there too. It stops going from my bluetooth headset to the car then I have to switch where the music is going manually. All that hassle could have been avoided by just plug and unplug.	lvlegabyte	t3_66c5sr

t3_66c5sr	t1_dgiffkc	1492690600	In a few years when Bluetooth headphones are the norm, this won't be an issue. Someone had to start the ball rolling, why not Apple? I've heard really good things about the AirPods, this is just the start of a big change for personal electronics. Most personal devices come with Bluetooth already so the headphones are compatible. I use a pair of BT headphones at home between iPhone, iPad, and PC and whilst there is something to click or tap to disconnect/connect each device, it's great and I can't say I miss wired. Sometimes a bit of a pain because of charging, but the AirPods even have that covered it seems.	spl1ced	t1_dghji7r

t3_66lzez	t1_dgk6lp2	1492782625	&gt; Only problem is that you probably need to be a PhD to figure it out and beat the team of them that designed the games.   There is probably no way to beat the game. Except in rare cases,  each ticket will cost more than your expected winnings.  For the Powerball, the odds of winning are 1 in  292,201,338 and tickets cost $2 each.  So, if you spent $584,402,676 on tickets you would be sure to win.  The problem is that even if the jackpot gets that high you can't be sure you will be the only winner.	qrpc	t1_dgk595o

t3_66lzez	t1_dgk9b9z	1492786020	&gt;There is probably no way to beat the game  It's already happened, so by definition its possible.  &gt;Except in rare cases  Yes, this is what I'm saying. Using your example, Joan Ginther (a Stanford PhD specializing in statistics) figured out a lotteries method of distributing winning tickets among all the tickets among the rest of the tickets, so the expected value of the tickets she purchased was greater than the $2 she spent on them. She won 4 lotteries for ~20 million. Crucially, lottery tickets are not truly randomly distributed so she was able to find heuristics that gave her better than average odds.  When your expected value of playing is profitable even after taxes, other winners, and your investors interest charges, you can say you've 'beaten' the game.	-SoItGoes	t1_dgk6lp2
t3_66lzez	t1_dgk9q3z	1492786506	Not trolling.  There's not enough info given, so Siri does her best.  The question is incomplete.   "I have a quantity of marbles and I select another quantity at random.  What are the odds that I pick at least one white one?"	McBurger	t1_dgjyfw3
t3_66lzez	t1_dgkby8j	1492789074	I didn't say it wasn't possible.  I've heard of other cases where lotteries and raffles did a poor job of randomizing tickets, but unless those errors are there, you won't improve your odds no matter how smart you are.  &gt; When your expected value of playing is profitable even after taxes..  If you paid $584M to win $585M your taxable income is only $1M. Taxes are a factor, but it's not as huge a bill as you or I would get spending $2 on a ticket.	qrpc	t1_dgk9b9z
t3_66lzez	t1_dgkcnrr	1492789877	Again, lotteries _cannot_ be based on a random distribution of tickets, so by this simple fact there is a method by which these tickets are allocated - this can always be gamed. It's more accurate to say that the game is inherently beatable, since designers can only randomize allocations to a certain extent.	-SoItGoes	t1_dgkby8j

t3_66lzez	t1_dgki2a3	1492795909	I see how scratch-off tickets created and printed according to an algorithm would be, at best, pseudo-random unless the companies had a good source of randomness, but in the case of a "powerball" type lottery any bias in the selection of winning numbers large enough to make the game reliably beatable would be obvious.	qrpc	t1_dgkcnrr

t3_66lzez	t1_dgklyhm	1492800369	Well, if McDonalds was in charge of the lottery, in which case the employees make sure to preselect their tickets and you will never win.   Basically, you didn't ask the odds of a FAIR lottery.	N2B8R	t1_dgk7jx8

t3_66rjg9	t1_dgkq9o5	1492805454	The name escapes me but it's a type of corrosion. it's more likely to happen is the 6s because Apple changed the aluminum alloy in the phone (less zinc I believe)   do you have your phone in moist environments?	jumpingjellybeanss	t3_66rjg9
t3_66rjg9	t1_dgkrkrx	1492807053	Oh, that's interesting. Yeah I would call AppleCare.	93throwaway19	t1_dgkph35
t3_66rjg9	t1_dgkrwc7	1492807448	Just did. Unfortunately, they told me it probably came from the case I use, or using it with wet hands or the environment (seriously).

t3_66rjg9	t1_dgks05o	1492807581	I researched it and it is what you are thinking, but it has more zinc. Unfortunately, theres nothing I can do to prevent it.  I live in Brazil, the humidity is kinda high.	carlosalima	t1_dgkq9o5

t3_66rjg9	t1_dgkubg0	1492810525	Looks like dirt is getting up the case and scratching your phone. I have a 6s plus now going on 6 months no case and doesn't have these scratches.	Iammattieee	t3_66rjg9
t3_66rjg9	t1_dgkvixy	1492812131	Yeah it's corrosion, not so much to do with dusts or dirt grinding your phone since apple leather cases do relatively well to prevent those. I had 3 previous 6S devices as well and only 1 of them didn't have this issue.	SJUNLIN	t1_dgks05o
t3_66rjg9	t1_dgkvxx8	1492812709	I would take it into the Apple Store. Make an appointment for it. I worked for AppleCare and we had very scripted answers. The Apple stores tend to be more human and could probably help you better.	93throwaway19	t1_dgkrwc7
t3_66rjg9	t1_dgkzng3	1492817891	It's probably from water or humidity. I see this all the time on iPhone 7s because people get them wet or take them in the shower and don't take off the case to dry it off afterwards.	Rkziki	t3_66rjg9

t3_66w3gb	t1_dgn91qk	1492964356	Because somehow it managed to not let one of them join because they didn't live with me. Which is weird because I put all the dam address and everything but 5 days later they got shut off.   Plus the battery life is a little wonky. I use mine at work a lot and I started bringing a backup battery because spotify would run it down to 10-20% by 2 o'clock.	Hangloosebra	t1_dgmw0do
t3_66w3gb	t1_dgn990j	1492964621	Also if Apple doesn't fixed the music app very soon then tough luck for the family. I need my tasty jams not pausing and shutting off and not streaming. Spotify never gave me these problems	Hangloosebra	t1_dgmw0do
t3_66w3gb	t1_dgn9qfb	1492965274	You used the same address for all of them? I currently have 3 people who don't live with me and it's been fine.  As for the battery life, I thought it was just me. It seems that the app stays running in the background even if you're not using it. Went from 40 to 14 overnight today.

t3_678ldm	t1_dgozf7x	1493058280	&gt;I've never understood the popularity of the white models for this reason.  As well as Apple's reluctance to offer any other colours with a black face.	Workywork15	t1_dgoyi91

t3_678ldm	t1_dgp0ihm	1493059447	It was a small problem with the S7, no problems at all with the S8. I like iPhones but that iPhone 8 looks like a shitty Chinese knock off. Horrid camera lens and the rounded corners looks bad combined with the thickness and awkward screen proportions.	SACKO_	t1_dgozwal
t3_678ldm	t1_dgp0kii	1493059508	From a business standpoint, I think its more likely that they'd release a "pro" version of the iPhone at the same time with a higher pricetag in order to crunch a little more margin out of sales.	MacroFlash	t1_dgp047s
t3_678ldm	t1_dgp1bh5	1493060330	I don't know that many people that take photos horizontally. Most of the photos my friend group shares are through Snapchat which I believe in turn is conditioning us to take normal photos the same way.	sirthunt	t1_dgoszwb
t3_678ldm	t1_dgp270e	1493061296	As /u/MacroFlash said, it's not gonna be "iPhone 8," it'll be "iPhone Pro." The point is that while they can bump the internals of the 7 and sell it for the normal price tag, they can also get heavy users to spend more money on the "Pro" line. It wouldn't cannibalize sales because even if less people buy the iPhone 7s, that's because they'll be spending *more* money on the iPhone Pro.	smith7018	t1_dgp047s
t3_678ldm	t1_dgp2d29	1493061483	I hate this render. It looks 95% like a 7. I want a ground-up, aggressive redesign.	anitasanger	t3_678ldm

t3_678ldm	t1_dgp2ybh	1493062121	There were similar rumors that the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 would be released at the same time..	BitingChaos	t1_dgopomm
t3_678ldm	t1_dgp2yxf	1493062139	Well, my dear Watson, I must disagree. Since 90% of the time I use my camera, I have it turned horizontally, I'm really happy to see it oriented this way.	taylikes	t1_dgp2ugt
t3_678ldm	t1_dgp3b2b	1493062491	I know Apple wants to limit the number of models they need to produce and stock, but I think they'd see a nice jump in sales if they offered the new aluminum finishes in the black faced models.	freediverx01	t1_dgp2l16

t3_678ldm	t1_dgp4jy4	1493063844	Oh definitely, the ball is in their court. I would love to see an all black model with gold highlights, but right now the easiest way to do that is via a skin. I remember last year a fake midnight blue was leaked, that looked very nice	SpartanSK117	t1_dgp3b2b
t3_678ldm	t1_dgp6myb	1493066136	Why not replace the speaker up top on the display with an electrodynamic exciter that uses your face when pressed to make the sound in your ear. Viola, solid surface front display.	Igotdaruns	t3_678ldm

t3_678ldm	t1_dgp84lv	1493067798	That's exactly what I think. This year there won't be a regular pattern like 7S because it's a 10 year anniversary so I'm 99% sure it's gonna be something special	majnus	t1_dgopttp
t3_678ldm	t1_dgp8atr	1493067999	A friend mentioned that the 8 will have dual sim. These plans seem to confirm it. Probably one of the most exciting things for me besides the usual slew of updates to the phone.	blair3d	t3_678ldm
t3_678ldm	t1_dgp966s	1493069046	I think they'll still do a 7S along side it. They'll just do it as a nominal "improved processor" update rather than additional features.	Jinno	t1_dgp84lv

t3_678ldm	t1_dgpa3le	1493070168	What does that have to do with the receiver i.e. the little hole in the display which gets caked with your ear funk, dead skin, etc? I have serviced these phones since the 3G, in an official capacity, for a retailer I will not name.	Igotdaruns	t1_dgp7ddo
t3_678ldm	t1_dgpa6x5	1493070277	As a white phone owner, it's because (to me) it looks less industrial. Less like a "gadget" and more like an art object. It also probably looks "cleaner", the same way people seem to prefer white cars.  When I shifted over to the dark side with the 7+ (jet black), I did have a minor psychological issue in that when it was off, it just looked like a black slab of nothingness. Sure, that's a positive, but to me it made it seem less like a cool thing and more like more clutter. I'm still not sure which I like better, the seamless black or the familiar clean white.

t3_678ldm	t1_dgq3xau	1493123468	&gt; As a white phone owner, it's because (to me) it looks less industrial. Less like a "gadget" and more like an art object.   Which goes back to my comment that white has always looked great on other Apple products. But for me this runs the appearance of an iPhone because of how it makes the screen, bezels, and ports stand out. A black iPhone, when turned off, looks like a seamless sheet of black glass.   &gt; the same way people seem to prefer white cars  I hate white cars, lol. I always associate white cars with old rich people driving to their restricted country club.	freediverx01	t1_dgpa6x5

Emulating and coding applications to work on various platforms is a really cool part of tech . I respect the time and effort the developers took to make their app work on as many things as possible . Sharing this project helps lead to more advances in how we make new games . I'm not sure how I'm being self centered but please tell me how I am ?    And what did you correct me on as well ? The game is coded and hosted on the website but in order to execute the code you need a compatible web browser to run it . I tried running it on my htc 8x windows phone and it didn't work well with missing textures and the on screen buttons won't respond. I doubt it didn't run well because of the website but because of my phone and the browser it uses .	AnthonyTheChamp	t1_dgqrm72

t3_67v3co	t1_dgthioz	1493297533	The only reason I switched to Pocket Casts from the Podcasts app is the ability to skip back/forward 15 or 30 seconds using the click gestures on my headphones, which also allows me to skip using the steering wheel back/forward buttons in my car when listening via Bluetooth.   I am glad I switched in general, though. Pocket Casts has a great UI, and I like the way they implement their filters. The Podcasts app now seems very clunky to me.	CarlChronicles	t1_dgtfx19

t3_67v3co	t1_dgtk4t7	1493301172	For me, I didn't like how clunky it was to download a podcast without listening to it. I felt like it took 2-3 clicks to accomplish it. Not a big deal, I know, but I listen to about 50 different podcasts. I like being able to quickly download 5-10 each night before work the next day.   Also, as mentioned the ability to forward or rewind 15 seconds is nice, options to remove silence from podcasts, options to speed up playback and the easily manageable playlist come in handy.

t3_67uyo0	t1_dgtoin0	1493306222	It's worrying the amount of people on the comments of the video saying B looked better.

Just got an S8+ last night and was shocked by the picture output of it. Maybe I'll have to look at a Pixel instead to satisfy my Android thirst and to accompany my 7 Plus.	djlaxl	t3_67uyo0
t3_67v3co	t1_dgtqe95	1493308243	It's already been said several times, but I use Pocket Casts.   I use it because of how easy it is to use as well as how feature rich it is. I subscribe to several different shows, some really long, and used to not be able to listen to them all before they all started dropping new episodes. Pocket Casts has a multitude of features that help you get through your shows faster without too much of a detriment to sound.   It has the ability to trim silence automatically (This one I had the hardest time getting used to becasue sometimes silence is intentionally added to a show). It can let you skip forward so you can jump right past ads. It can also let you speed up the show, which is one of my favorite features (I listen to all my podcasts at 1.2x, which I think is the limit before they start to sound too weird).   I also love that it syncs all my progress on all my shows across all of my devices. I have an iPhone, two Android tablets, and several computers and it doesn't matter where I am, I can always start right where I left off. It's a great feature.	DevinXtreme	t3_67v3co

t3_67v3co	t1_dgtslhk	1493310577	I'm with the majority here- PocketCasts is the best podcast app available. I've used it across multiple devices (iOS and Android) and its syncing capabilities are awesome. It has all of the features you'd expect in a top tier podcast player.	nevarlaw	t3_67v3co
t3_67hbga	t1_dgtsv7q	1493310869	I think you're arguing something I didn't say. Also, OpenGL looks like an API to me, not a specification, so I'm not sure what you mean by that.  Apple had to implement OpenGL, sure, but they surely didn't write the code that allows this game to run using OpenGL. Thats why I was saying Safari isn't that great just because they can run OpenGL objects (or whatever you call them) in webpages.   Maybe I don't understand, but if I wrote a javascript game and it worked on safari, why would people go on saying safari is great because they can run javascript apps in their browser?

t3_67hbga	t1_dgtwgg6	1493314718	They implemented WebGL (and OpenGL for that matter) on their platform. They are part of the group that designed WebGL and they then took the spec and implemented it in their browser.  They absolutely wrote the code that allows the game to run in the browser. Apple engineers looked at the WebGL spec and implemented the code. The spec is small, writing the code is large.  95% of the work that went into making this demo work was done by Apple engineers. The other 5% of creating a little proof of concept is trivial. I could go write this tonight if I wanted (I have written webgl games).   This is a proof of concept/demo showing off the capabilities of WebGL.	barjam	t1_dgtsv7q

t3_67hbga	t1_dgtyq5e	1493317139	I see. I did a little research, and I've found that Apple did indeed help write part of WebGL, but so did Google, Mozilla and Opera. Literally all of the most popular browsers out there.  I have to disagree with you that 95% of the work was done by Apple. And sure, maybe its a proof of concept, but the author still had to do the work to port it to OpenGL.	GalacticSpaceTiger	t1_dgtwgg6
t3_67hbga	t1_dgtzl6j	1493318057	Last bit you said wrong, the guy didn't "port it to OpenGL". He used WebGL, a technology developed by apple, to write his demo. It is along the same lines of authoring a web page.  The complicated code involved with rendering a web page is in the browser, writing a document that works on a web browser is small potatoes.	barjam	t1_dgtyq5e
t3_67hbga	t1_dgu094z	1493318753	Wasn't WebGL developed by everyone I previously mentioned? I still don't get how you think this is all Apple.   My stance hasn't changed, I still think Apple isn't the only one that should get credit. Google Mozilla and Opera also contributed. Thank for your explanation of what WebGL and OpenGL are though, I can see the browser does most of the work.  But from what I understand all those companies worked on WebGL, so should you be crediting all of them instead of solely apple?	GalacticSpaceTiger	t1_dgtzl6j

t3_680lht	t1_dgut051	1493351563	Hardware or software failure that left me unable to text or call, yet able to use other services like YouTube, hangouts, reddit, etc. Within 24hrs.  Prior to that, the service I previously had in locations with my 5s, was non existent, if anything it should've been better. Places where I had LTE with my 5s, I had roaming with the S8. Within hours of getting the phone.  In addition I had a long delay between calling out and the connection actually being established, almost 30 seconds. No matter the service level.   A lot of game crashes, although I can't really pin point why.    Seems I also had a bugged clock app that I would need to make new alarms each time in order to utilize it at all.  I have only had the phone for a couple of days now and haven't really scratched the surface.  My only personal gripe is the over sensitive screen edges which would change or exit what I was doing entirely, with one errant tap or if I held it wrong.   Edit: Don't get me wrong the S8 seemed great, beautiful screen and good capacity, but I am a big first impressions consumer, and that was awful.	Aedeus	t1_dgus1df

t3_682ffe	t1_dgvd1as	1493395108	It's fine, although I'd definitely recommend 128GB for most people. I typically have 3-4GB free on my phone, which seems strange considering I'm using it the same way I used my 16GB iPhone 6s. So far, it's never been an issue (I've never had to frantically clear out space for something else), but I definitely enjoy having a 128GB iPad.  One thing I didn't fully anticipate, or at least appreciate the magnitude of, is the performance difference between the 32GB and 128GB models. My 2017 iPad is often faster for many operations than my 7 Plus, and it all has to do with the read/write speeds on the storage. Read speeds are *usually* comparable, but write speeds on my 7 Plus are only about a tenth of what I get on the iPad (28MB/s compared to about 275MB/s). This won't impact most users in any meaningful way, but it's definitely something I've noticed.	greatcaffeine	t1_dgvcaf5

t3_682ffe	t1_dgvhg4s	1493399916	You both seem like really nice people :-)  I just got my 7plus yesterday, upgraded from my old 5s. I have an iPad Air 2 also. Benchmarking tests have been really interesting for me for the past 24 hours. Lots of fun stuff to dig into. What app/apps do you prefer or recommend?	powertripp82	t1_dgvf27q
t3_683ttv	t1_dgvi1bo	1493400565	Thanks for the input. I was actually wondering about the software experience. Would the software experience differ drastically between the two because this would be my entry to IOS and at this point software differences mean more to me than the hardware.	TalhaQ	t1_dgvg41c
t3_682ffe	t1_dgvi1qj	1493400578	This is a good answer, I think. However I got a "genius" whose software said my battery was fine. My mistake was that it too me a couple of weeks to get to the Apple Store. I just kept my phone plugged in all the time so the log of battery discharge didn't show the anomalies I was experiencing.  It was not fine, so I pressed to get the battery replaced. It fixed all my troubles.	CursorTN	t1_dgv5dcj
t3_683ttv	t1_dgvi7c3	1493400746	Whichever you choose you'll get years of updates which is the biggest plus of iOS.	michael8684	t1_dgvi1bo
t3_682ffe	t1_dgvie96	1493400957	My 6 is almost just as bad. Unfortunately Apple disappointed us with the 7 so I didn't want to waste an upgrade on it. I'm really hoping they don't fuck up the 8. I'm waiting on the release to upgrade but if it's basically just a 7+ with little to no changes, I don't think I'll stick with Apple very much longer.	21Blankenship	t3_682ffe
t3_682ffe	t1_dgvigic	1493401025	Depends on what you're trying to test, really. For CPU and memory, Geekbench has pretty much taken over as the standard benchmark. It's available for iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS, so it can be a great tool for comparing performance on devices that are otherwise very different. Here's a link comparing the scores for my iPhone 7 Plus and the Surface Pro 4 I use at work: https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/compare/2690098?baseline=2690035  As for storage, that's a little more difficult. I was using an old app called PerformanceTest to get quick disk read/write speeds, but it doesn't seem like the most thorough benchmark. I'd definitely like to find something else, but I don't want to commit money to something without a recommendation from someone.	greatcaffeine	t1_dgvhg4s
t3_683ttv	t1_dgvioeo	1493401264	Galaxy s8 no doubt (i have a 7plus but if it wasn't for my Apple Watch i would sell it rigth out for the s8)	bdelboss	t3_683ttv
t3_682ffe	t1_dgviskx	1493401390	Replacement program is 6s only. Apple will replace consumer batteries for $79 out of warranty or at no cost under warranty or AppleCare.	jurassic_alan	t1_dgvegbx
t3_682sbd	t1_dgvitqk	1493401425	A9 is still a great chip. They put 2GB in the 7 as well. You'll be good for 2-3 years, don't worry about it. Maybe replacing the battery at some point will be a good idea, but that's like less than $90 at the Apple Store.	95487369	t3_682sbd
t3_683ttv	t1_dgvj0fm	1493401633	I personally don't like Galaxy phones. I used a Galaxy S5 back in the day but TouchWiz kills the experience for me and I may get alot of flak for saying this but I hate curved displays. They make the phone impossible to handle but that's just my opinion I guess because people seem to love it.	TalhaQ	t1_dgvioeo
t3_683ttv	t1_dgvj5xl	1493401802	I get the edge display hate (I share the feeling) but definitely when you're in a store check out the new Touchwiz on an S7 and S8. Much more refined than what there was back in the Note 4/S5.	95487369	t1_dgvj0fm
t3_683ttv	t1_dgvjodg	1493402362	I have checked the S7 Edge (Friend has one) TouchWiz and it is leaps and bounds better than before but it never stays as fresh over time. Also fingerprint location on the S8 is plain stupid. The S8 is a great phone no doubt but I feel it was hastily put together you know. I believe we will get the refined version with the Note 8 later this year.	TalhaQ	t1_dgvj5xl
t3_682sbd	t1_dgvjwgb	1493402607	Apple is still officially selling the iPhone 5S in my country for around $270. While still capable people should know better than to buy an almost 4 year old phone. SE is $425, that's the least i would go. 6S is still too expensive at $600.	green9206	t1_dgv7q47
t3_683ttv	t1_dgvk07j	1493402724	I would suggest 6S simply because it should be atleast $200 cheaper than 7.	green9206	t3_683ttv
t3_682ffe	t1_dgvk432	1493402844	I have a 7 32GB and personally don't store music on my phone and I copy the photos off to my desktop everyone month or so, so there's not much to accumulate. I don't install tons of apps. I like minimalism and I stream most music (Spotify or Google Play) which does cache some music. Though I do hover around 80%-90% full storage usually	elislider	t1_dgvcaf5

t3_682ffe	t1_dgvl32n	1493403930	I did the same when mine acted up. It also went into a boot loop once or twice and as soon as I said the magic word "boot loop" they replaced it on the spot. No questions asked!	OG_PANCAKE_HOUSE	t1_dgv97pf
t3_682ffe	t1_dgvlg37	1493404329	Yeah your phone's completely broken.  Tell ya what, I'll be generous and buy it off you for $40.	JuliettPapaRomeo	t3_682ffe

t3_682sbd	t1_dgvmbe0	1493405296	My 6S battery is in the replacement program so I'll use it until it's almost dead, then replace the battery for free. Might spring for a new display to get a "new" phone.	harrythehousefly	t3_682sbd
t3_682ffe	t1_dgvn5ta	1493406244	&gt; I upgraded from 6 to 7 and it was meh.  I did the same and everything was noticeably faster. My 6's battery also had issues too. I feel like I got one from the bad batch.	Shadow14l	t1_dgv3t1d
t3_683ttv	t1_dgvn81k	1493406315	Travel a lot? If you do then I suggest the 6S. Can't imagine pulling out dongles all the time for each time I wanna listen to music. Half the time when I'm travelling I'm already plugged in to my power bank to keep my phone alive for google maps and camera usage.	incognitodream	t3_683ttv
t3_682ffe	t1_dgvnav6	1493406406	The 7 comes with an adapter, and it only costs like $20 to add Bluetooth to a car. Just a matter of which Chinese brand you've never heard of you want to trust.

t3_683ttv	t1_dgvonut	1493407971	It's actually incredible how alive the phone feels with this haptic feedback. You need to experience it to understand. It's so polished and smooth that I don't think android can sway me back anytime soon!	Krishrox2000	t1_dgvilzf
t3_682ffe	t1_dgvp54p	1493408525	If you wait for the '8', you're likely to be paying a lot more than if you just buy an iPhone 7 now - rumours turn out to be true. It's thought this new fabled iPhone could cost upwards of $1500.	Jarrrp	t3_682ffe
t3_683ttv	t1_dgvpeom	1493408833	If you're interested the S8 is a very good phone, I played around with a colleagues and damn, gorgeous.  That said I'd go with the iPhone 7, faster, better battery, screen, camera and overall user experience and pick up some wireless headphones.	UnMaltese	t3_683ttv

t3_683ttv	t1_dgvq02h	1493409539	Or alternatively get wireless headphones? I travel a lot, I have BeatsX and Sennheiser PXC 550, both are brilliant options for travel with the BeatsX being fantastic for my commute and breaks (8 hours battery) and the PXC 550's are perfect for flights (up to 30 hours battery).  Seriously, if you travel and have a battery pack, wireless is the way to go although I'd say wireless is the way if you do any kind of exercise or hate cables, which is me all the way.	UnMaltese	t1_dgvn81k
t3_682ffe	t1_dgvq8sg	1493409827	I know it does, but it'd be cool if I didn't have to carry around a dongle everywhere.	SySTeMaT1c	t1_dgvnav6
t3_680lht	t1_dgvqvsj	1493410568	&gt; In addition I had a long delay between calling out and the connection actually being established, almost 30 seconds. No matter the service level.  This isn't an S8 problem, I have this on my iPhone 7+, Note5 and old iPhone 5. It's a carrier problem that's related to signal strength, regardless of being on 3G or 4G or at least that is what I've been told and it seems to make sense as it always happens outside of London and sometimes in if I'm at Waterloo.	UnMaltese	t1_dgut051
t3_683ttv	t1_dgvqxxa	1493410637	I don't travel that much but I just don't like the idea of not being able to listen to music and charge my phone. Secondly, I don't want to live the dongle life though I can go wireless.  I wonder whether Apple will bring the jack back on the next iPhone.	TalhaQ	t1_dgvq02h

t3_680lht	t1_dgvr3jf	1493410822	Coming from a 5S, i hadn't had anything like that occur to me before.	Aedeus	t1_dgvqvsj
t3_683ttv	t1_dgvr9pd	1493411029	It is, I've been iOS and Android, constantly switching between the two but iOS has better optimised apps due to the uniformity of Apple's design whereas Android has to cater to hundreds of different possibilities. That alone lends Apple the lead in app sleekness.  You'll enjoy coming from Android to iOS, it'll be weird at first but then it'll be all you can use. I still say the 7 is the better pick overall.	UnMaltese	t1_dgvr3gq
t3_682sbd	t1_dgvrjsj	1493411361	You'll probably get about another year out of it. iPhones tend to have a useful limit of about 3 years - if your battery hasn't turned to complete mush before then.	Jarrrp	t3_682sbd
t3_682sbd	t1_dgvrn41	1493411473	I have a 6s plus and it's still as awesome as the day I got it. Zero issues.   6s will for sure last 2 years. Tons of people still rocking the 5s even. 5s is still even smooth IMO. Good to go man!	MrRiggs	t3_682sbd
t3_682ffe	t1_dgvrntm	1493411496	I've told myself countless times that I'd replace my battery if everything else works fine. But I always end up upgrading my phone.	thesmithtopher	t1_dgv3w5j
t3_683ttv	t1_dgvrtf0	1493411684	I got the 7+ and thought I'd hate using the dongle but the truth is, I just leave the dongle attached to my headphones and it makes no difference. I also purchased BeatsX and I really love the wireless connection. Even though my wired headphones are a million times better (cIEMs), I find myself using the BeatsX more and more. YMMV.	guitarno0b	t1_dgvqxxa
t3_680lht	t1_dgvs05i	1493411912	Tbh you wouldn't expect or realise that's the issue, a lot of people think it is their phone but in reality, anything like that is a SIM card or network issue. Live and learn eh!	UnMaltese	t1_dgvr3jf

t3_682ffe	t1_dgvudib	1493414926	No rumour can be confirmed. If it's a special edition iPhone, it will cost more. If it's the only iPhone they release this year, it'll be the same price as always.  Even then. You'd be wise not to underestimate Apple's ability to screw you over.	Jarrrp	t1_dgvucct

t3_682ffe	t1_dgvupq9	1493415371	If you are out of warranty, go to a third party shop and have them put a new battery in your phone. The new battery gives you just about the same amount of power you had when your phone was brand new. That way you can last till Oct/Nov this year when they release the v8 device.	cmagnuson	t3_682ffe

The 5S might even get six years due to the massive speed jump it had over the five.   You're good for more than a couple years on the 6S.	InsaneNinja	t3_682sbd

t3_682ffe	t1_dgvv2th	1493415851	Go to your Spotify app, where your library songs are listed, and hit the "offline" switch at the top of the list.    It'll cache all your songs locally. Might as well take advantage of all that unused space.	InsaneNinja	t1_dgvuzjl
t3_682sbd	t1_dgvv43y	1493415900	iOS is a disgusting OS in terms of forcing their customers to update the iOS which slows down your device pretty much after every single update. It's Apple's way of forcing their consumers to regularly upgrade iPhones, iPad's etc. Otherwise people would be happy using their old devices without upgrading if they were able to keep up to the performance they produced when it was first bought.  I've got an iPad 3 which I got brand new when it was just out. The only applications I have ever downloaded onto it was Netflix, Spotify and one game. Nothing else since I only use it for entertainment. Was super quick when new, however several updates later after a few years, it can barely even open web pages and takes a shit long time to load. It's not a fucking performance intensive task either, if it was able to do it at super speeds when it was new, why can't it do the same exact task after updating the iOS multiple times.  Oh and I love how I always click No on the update notification that I get on the home screen and it then tries to force me to setup an automatic update at 4AM lol.   I'd avoid getting the 6S unless you can get one on the OS version that it was first launched with and then refuse to update it.	DieselMofu	t3_682sbd

t3_682sbd	t1_dgvva7p	1493416129	I do that because I factor in the increasing camera abilities, and the reselling price of my previous gen phone, which knocks over 300 off the new device.   I have a small case of FOMO as well, about new tech.   Some people just justify the fee to update the most often used computer in their lives.	InsaneNinja	t1_dgvprn3

t3_682ffe	t1_dgvvpt9	1493416683	Does apple replace the battery for free one time on the phone? I thought I read some where they will replace it after 1 year or 2 years?	MirrorVision	t3_682ffe
t3_682sbd	t1_dgvvreh	1493416740	The iPhone 6s is my first iPhone ever, and I've had it a little over a year. I was a big Android guy before, and I still keep up on specs and features. I know iPhones don't need as much horsepower, as it were, because the OS is so lightweight and optimised for the hardware, but the 6s was the first time I really put an iPhone on the same level as (and slightly above) Android flagships. Partly due to prejudice (I used to be an iPhone hater, haha — but I then converted two other iPhone haters, bahaha) but also because NVMe, because force touch, because the A9 is a beast, and the camera may be matched, but I don't think it's cleanly beaten. Basically, I got what was for me the best phone available last April.   To more directly answer, I usually replace Android phones after 12–18 months. I expect to carry this phone through 2019 at least. I'm expecting to get at least 3.5 years out of it. That's another two years. It's a good little phone!	dragontology	t3_682sbd
t3_683ttv	t1_dgvvvli	1493416894	True, I did notice on the S7 It got slow over time whereas iOS tends to stay snappy. I was looking at the S8 but the fingerprint scanner placement is atrocious and the other unlock options are slower. Note 8 will be great hopefully	95487369	t1_dgvjodg
t3_683ttv	t1_dgvw5b4	1493417257	I'd say always get the newer device if that's an option. It will be useful longer. I have a 6S+ and I'm a little wary about the headphone issue, but whatever. I wouldn't sweat it. The phone comes with lightning earbuds and a lightning to regular headphone adaptor I believe and it'll give you a good excuse to buy some nice bluetooth cans if you don't have some already.    It's annoying and I'm not going to defend the party line that they "had" to do this. Of course the didn't. It's just Apple being Apple. They like pushing obsolete standards over the cliff by making moves like this. They killed the floppy disk and serial ports the same way. I've been watching them do this for years. It's not as big of a deal as people make it. Within 2 years I bet most Android makers will have followed suit and most people will not even care anymore. The inability to charge and listen via wire at the same time is kind of annoying, but they probably have some kind of adaptor for that. It is what it is...	Fendahl_core	t3_683ttv

Then I realized I was constantly using my work iPhone when I wanted to surf Reddit, or otherwise waste time. And it was a year older than my android. The experience is just so much smoother.   Now I'm on my third iPhone. Can't see going back to android.	echocrest	t1_dgvu2j9

t3_682ffe	t1_dgvz4yh	1493421557	It's still mind boggling to me how much we consume and store these days digitally that we need 128GB+ storage (not judging having that much storage I've just never been able to imagine how much content that is) I do perfectly fine with 16GB, 32GB is a lot. I once had a 128GB Nexus 6P and barely used a few GB.   On my 32GB iPhone 7 I have around 5 GB filled up. Photos go straight to the cloud when I get a chance (phones get stolen, stop working, etc - so I upload anything I could want in the future to the cloud and don't really keep it in my phone, I can access the google photos app if I need to download or see that content) and a small (~400 songs) spotify offline library, and about 15 or less apps. Never even gotten close to filling it up.	95487369	t1_dgvcaf5

t3_682ffe	t1_dgvzjmc	1493422127	My battery (on my 6 - I'm on my phone at the moment and can't remember if I have a flair) isn't the greatest either (though, lasts more than an hour of texting). Personally I'm waiting for the 8 to see if that tickles my fancy otherwise I'll go in for the 7.   If I was in your position I'd spend money getting a new battery so that it'll do me until the new release and then at least you can resell the phone with a relatively new battery being fitted so you won't be out of pocket for long.	7heDaniel	t3_682ffe

t3_682sbd	t1_dgw2mkt	1493426261	Like everyone else is saying. 6s will be good for a while. It's got 2GB ram and isn't missing any functional hardware features that the 7 has so anything that comes to the 7 software wise should also come to the 6s. The A9 is so fast that performance shouldn't really get worse with updates as has been the case on past iPhone models.	thepookster17	t3_682sbd
t3_682ffe	t1_dgw3mew	1493427556	Yep, my 6s was dying in the 20% range so I took it in, they replaced the battery for free. You should be able to look up the model numbers effected on Apple's site.	Drakorex	t1_dgvbdj4

t3_683ttv	t1_dgwjqtq	1493461323	Just go for the 7 if it's within your budget, honestly, I switched from a HTC One M8, you won't miss the 3.5mm headphone jack, I just leave the adapter plugged into my earphones all the time, it's basically just a different plug now, everything else is the same. (unless you always listen to music while your phone's charging)  Oh, and apps are better or at least as good on iOS, period. (especially Snapchat, damn them for making Snapchat so bad on Android)  Another thing, don't worry about the 32 GB iPhone 7's whole "slower storage" fiasco, that was mainly because the storage benchmarking apps exceeded the SLC cache of the phone, and went into the TLC cache, with TLC being much slower than SLC (the ratio of SLC to TLC flash storage stays the same for all models, hence why it exceeded the SLC cache for the models with lower storage sizes, but not for those with higher storage sizes). Unless, that is, you happen to copy huge files to and from your phone often.  As for the whole modem ordeal with the Qualcomm modem models (A1660 and A1661) having faster network speeds than the Intel modem models (A1778 and A1784), there's not much of a speed difference with good reception (so urban and suburban areas) but there is a substantial difference in areas with poor reception (ie rural areas), so go with the Qualcomm modem models if you live rural. Then again, none of this modem "debacle" crap matters if you don't live in the US/Canada/China/Puerto Rico, since you only get the Intel models everywhere else.  EDIT: faster, not slower	GastroAffectedCastro	t3_683ttv

I'm also a fitness instructor and have a playlist for when I'm teaching. Those songs are not songs that I particularly like, but they work for the job.

t3_689130	t1_dgxc2qe	1493506822	Something that might be easier and is free. Many car insurance companies are offering something that my insurance calls enroute. It's a little box you plug into the computer port in your car and it tracks everything. You can login and access a plethora of information.  It doesn't quite give you real time coverage, what happens is when you turn the car off it saves the last route and then uploads it as soon as you turn the car on.   I use it because it saves me 25% a year on my car insurance. I don't care if they know where I was if it saves me that much money.	angelcake	t3_689130

Much easier option to just say, "Don't track this session". That could also come in handy for when I'm in the car with my 12 year old daughter and she wants me to play the type of music that 12 year old girls listen to. I'd really love it if that _didn't_ influence AM's recommendations for me.  So I can see at least a few use cases for it.	charliegriefer	t1_dgxius1

t3_68gh1t	t1_dgye9y4	1493578767	But that's what the new button already is. A non moving bit of glass that uses a sub level haptic engine to produce the "click". Given that the technology is already there and the recent patent filings I'd bet money on the home button being sub screen on the new device without issue.

t3_68gh1t	t1_dgyz8q6	1493606942	Totally. Like if Apple ran into a large shipping delay, it would be an awesome back up. The sheeple don't seem to agree though.	KrombopulosMichael23	t1_dgyyzsp

t3_68kz10	t1_dgzf2uq	1493644583	My sister has been using one for her 6 plus without issues for more than 2 yrs now and the phone decides the charge rate given factors like temperature.  However, there was much more heat generated on my 7 :( which i am not so comfortable with...even though it charged from 5 to 50 in 30min flat. Guess I'll stick to 1A.	woahacow	t1_dgzcvc9
t3_68kz10	t1_dgzf3qg	1493644625	Then why don't they ship out the iPad charger as the standard charger with the iPhone?	iGwlbirdy	t1_dgzf2av
t3_68kz10	t1_dgzf459	1493644644	How is the heat? Mine heated up a bit though not so bad as my 5s used to..	woahacow	t1_dgzcc6p
t3_68kz10	t1_dgzf65c	1493644737	That's exactly what tech blogs and youtubers have been asking since the iPhone 6. It's probably something stupid like it's bigger and wouldn't fit in the box or something. Or they want people to buy iPad chargers. Idk   I personally have been charging with a 2.4A iPad charger for 2+ years first iPhone 6 now the 7 and didn't see any negative effects	alphaboy	t1_dgzf3qg
t3_68kz10	t1_dgzfgv2	1493645214	I think doing this constantly will have no effect short term. However, for the longevity of the battery, I think it will cause some wear and tear for your battery, due to the heat. If you plan on replacing your battery every 2 years or so, maybe it won't matter as much for you. (Though replacing battery for the 7 is trickier because of the water resistant adhesive that loosens up when u remove back. You'd wiser to let it replace by Apple)	iGwlbirdy	t1_dgzf2uq

t3_68kz10	t1_dgzia0n	1493649274	Honestly, I think youre fine cause I use the 2.1 charging ever since the 5. Currently on the 7.   If it makes you feel better you can always charge it on a "cold" surface to address the extra heat generated.	Ehwic	t1_dgzi3u7
t3_68kz10	t1_dgzk2x3	1493651616	Yes even my sis has been using the 12w charger since she got her 6 plus, still lasts about the same after 2+ years... I believe the 5 and 5s didn't support higher than 1a charging or did they?	woahacow	t1_dgzia0n
t3_68kz10	t1_dgzkbs2	1493651922	I tried it and mine heated up a bit but nowhere near what my 5s used to be like...charged really quickly though.	woahacow	t1_dgzi5h8
t3_68kz10	t1_dgzkdcr	1493651978	Well I've charged with 2.1A whether it was supported or not and I never had any issues with battery/charging in the 3 years I've owned the phone.	Ehwic	t1_dgzk2x3

t3_68kz10	t1_dgzkksm	1493652232	Ya they wouldve charged just the same with any power charger.. its the phone that pulls the supported amount of current.	woahacow	t1_dgzkdcr
t3_68ko9e	t1_dgzknbi	1493652316	Did you tap Select in top right corner?  I dont have a 6s to try, but it worked on my 5, 5s, 6 and Mini 2.	tauffx	t1_dgzkj00
t3_68kz10	t1_dgzm90t	1493654268	5S doesn't support 2.1A charging. That started with the 6. That said, my 7 doesn't heat up too much. The actual charging brick does, however.	jakeuten	t1_dgzf459
t3_68kz10	t1_dgzmr7w	1493654877	I haven't tried an iPad charger, but the one I got from Amazon (2.4A) will charge my phone in less then 1.5 hours.	MiLK_Mi	t1_dgza5x8
t3_68kz10	t1_dgzmut9	1493654998	I've always used an iPad charger with my iPhone 6, day 1 and I got it the day it was released. My mother in law has it now, still uses the same charger and it keeps the same charge life as before. We're talking 2 3/4 years and the battery is still going like a champ.  My wife uses the iPad charger and used it on her 6, she gave it away and it still keeps a charge.  We do charge at night only, and she prefers the house at 71º while sleeping.	Kovis	t3_68kz10
t3_68kz10	t1_dgzn96n	1493655473	I know it didn't, i was commenting on how badly it used to heat up with 1A. N yes it wasn't exactly "hot" but it got warmer than 1a quite understandably. M using that 12w charger with a raspberry pi though will probably get the cheaper samsung 2A charger for it. The speed now seems worth it.	woahacow	t1_dgzm90t
t3_68ko9e	t1_dgznqsj	1493656048	Just knowing that pressing and holding the shoot button to take like 12 pictures was a godsend. Amazing feature to make sure you get the perfect photo. Thanks for the tip.	Death_Star_	t3_68ko9e
t3_68kz10	t1_dgzo9ht	1493656651	The safety of using 2.1A charger has been questioned in hundreds of threads online. Let me give you my personal rundown based on what I've read over the years:  - YES, it works.  - YES, it will charge faster than the supplied 1A charger.  - It is SAFE for the battery because the phone regulates how much power should go to the device.  - It is NOT good for the battery because the battery will go through more charge cycles faster. Battery physics state that the faster you charge a battery, the faster it will drain (This rule applies when you change amperage. Changing the charging tech to QC, for example, requires a different comparison and analysis).  - It MAY not be good for the battery because of the additional heat produced as little of an increase as it may be. YMMV as users have reported differences.  - It is a good idea for those moments in life you are in a rush or travelling.  - For overnight charging (those who like to charge their phone while they sleep for 6+ hours), it is recommended to use the lower 1A charger so as to reduce possible additional heat (see above) and reduce discharge in use (see above).  TL;DR - Do what you gotta do. Both chargers are safe and have valid reasons to support them. This is as much a user preference as your home screen icon layout. :)	asschompster	t3_68kz10

t3_68kz10	t1_dh0dn9g	1493686683	I should warn you; Android phones which utilize Quick Charging tend to experience a higher rate of battery capacity loss over time-and they actually come with these quick chargers out of the box.

t3_68ppqp	t1_dh0ebui	1493687493	I honestly really hope they'll add swipe texting to the stock keyboard. I love Gboard but would love for the stock one to have the functionality. Unless there is a patent problem I'm amazed it hasn't already been implemented	dabear04	t3_68ppqp

t3_68ppqp	t1_dh0evc8	1493688153	I'm using gboard as well, but I agree they should either do this or work on third party keyboard implementation. It's still pretty buggy.	-notausername_	t1_dh0ebui
t3_68ppqp	t1_dh0f3xi	1493688441	Yeah Gboard is by far the least buggy of the third party ones I've used but you're right, it's just not quite as snappy as the stock one.	dabear04	t1_dh0evc8
t3_68ppqp	t1_dh0f8ne	1493688598	I meant more so how the os handles them, sometimes randomly opening the wrong keyboard, etc. I agree though that most aren't as snappy as stock, however gboard is totally still my go to.

t3_68ppqp	t1_dh0fwdj	1493689396	True. Once I put Gboard as the first one in my list in settings and deleted the stock one it seemed pretty consistent. Rarely I would see the emoji come up and the stock one still comes up for passwords even though it was deleted.	dabear04	t1_dh0f8ne

t3_68ppqp	t1_dh0hfir	1493691244	It's the best overall smart phone on the market since forever. However, the lead they have over their competition is dwindling by the day and other manufacturers are catching up rapidly.	scatmango	t1_dh0hbj1
t3_68ppqp	t1_dh0hn4a	1493691491	I can't really think of a phone that is as consistently good overall. It may not be the best at any one given thing, but then I feel like any phone you're choosing for the best screen, the best camera, etc.. you're always sacrificing something else. The iPhone is either good or great at pretty much everything. This and the lag on Android is what kinda won me over to iOS, that and the super inconsistent battery life. I like how reliable my 7 plus is.  TL;DR - I'm not sure what competition you're referring to. I can't think of any phone that gets close when I consider all sides.	-notausername_	t1_dh0hfir

t3_68ppqp	t1_dh0iq63	1493692754	Yeah but when you mentioned competition coming close, I can't think of another phone that has near as complete of a package.

t3_68ppqp	t1_dh0nbnf	1493699366	I have a feeling that white with bold text look might be what they're gravitating towards honestly, potentially to get away from the transparency and make it easier to have a dark mode and light mode, especially with the amoled screens that are coming.

t3_68ppqp	t1_dh0o9b2	1493701077	I've been an Apple customer for a veeeery long time, so I know not to expect much in the way of change for iOS, but I think we're at (or past) the point where we can start expecting more out of the OS.  iOS has so much potential, but feels so gimped when it comes to even the most basic things (Can't move icons, control center isn't customizable, volume HUD is garbage, etc). I look at Android, and I see features that would be awesome to have on iOS, I think it's time that Apple up their game.  Considering iOS 10's main features boiled down to:  * Ability to delete system apps  * Widgets moved from NC to Lock Screen  * iMessage Gimmicks  * Siri Integration with apps  I don't think it's unfair to expect a bit more on the feature side this year. Here are some of the many things that I would like to see in iOS 11.   * Ability to fully customize control center. Let me change the top 5 buttons, swap the bottom ones for apps, etc. Also, let us rearrange the buttons in a way that only takes up one page.   * Complete revamp of Notifications. I'm talking grouped notifications, snooze features, expanded settings on a per-app basis, etc  * Please fix the Volume HUD. Please?  * Considering the bezel-less design of the iPhone 8 means the top of the screen will be even harder to reach, we **need** the ability to place apps wherever we want on the homescreen, or at least have it start from the bottom.  * Dark mode. Pretty safe bet this is coming.  There's so much more that could be done with iOS (split screen multitasking, PIP, mac-like swipe gestures, an iOS version of Finder, serious workflow integration, etc), that I consider the list of features I suggested to be the bare minimum for iOS11. I'd never switch to Android (too heavily invested in the ecosystem), but if iOS 11 lacks anything substantial, I wouldn't blame iPhone users for switching.	throwawayvita	t3_68ppqp
t3_68kz10	t1_dh0pmez	1493703803	Actually I have the 12w charger but using it with a raspberry pi... yes 1A seems to be sufficient; if you go through my posts here I have flip flopped :P but the less heat generated the better for some longevity cause I do not know whether I will be able to afford another 2 years down the road (student loans x_x) so I am sticking with the 1A.	woahacow	t1_dh0esqk

t3_68t5cj	t1_dh12dvd	1493733577	Samsung has used glass backs for awhile now, since the S6 back in 2015 at least.  Other than it looking nice, I think part of it is that wireless charging works better through glass than it does metal.	redavid	t3_68t5cj

t3_68ppqp	t1_dh19wbm	1493742416	Dark mode if we are very, very lucky and Apple might even let us all use it instead of arbitrarily limiting it to the rumored OLED uber-phone.    I would forget about customization, themes or being able to move or place icons in any way other than the Apple-approved grid that aggressively snaps back into alignment. I would love everything you are suggesting, but I'm convinced that Apple will continue to be very inflexible about customization.  Grouped notifications, maybe. I would like to see improvements in notifications of some kind for sure, yes.    Personally, I am just hoping for system-wide dark mode. There are about 100 other things I *want* from iOS but I know better than to have anything but minimal expectations. That way if Apple doesn't do anything I want or care about I won't be disappointed, but if they come through with some meaningful improvements and something really useful I will be pleasantly surprised.    If they do nothing else by fix bugs and add dark mode, I'd be happy (assuming they don't make anything *worse* than it is now).    I don't know if it's reasonable to expect iOS11 to even be as dramatic and update as iOS10 was, but it might be. If so, my hope is just that Apple really vets it properly and there is a bare minimum of bugs.	Fendahl_core	t3_68ppqp

t3_68t5cj	t1_dh1a3k4	1493742634	The iPhone 4 and 4S was the most expensive model to manufacture. Although I'm sure there are various reasons why they transitioned to all aluminum, I'm convinced cost savings was a major consideration. Many still consider the 4/4s to be their most beautiful design to date (including myself.)	freediverx01	t3_68t5cj
t3_68t5cj	t1_dh1a6p9	1493742728	Lol that's a legit complaint, but don't let logic get in the way here.   Feel of the phone, despite inevitably being put in a case and rendered pointless, still matters to people.	Justice502	t1_dh1a2bw
t3_68ppqp	t1_dh1abml	1493742875	Hahaha.. yes indeed.   I had high hopes for Siri. I think Apple is taking it more seriously now but after 5 years of sitting still I have learned to expect nothing. Maybe one day it will be the useful companion app that actually understands and get shit done that we all dreamed of.   If Apple gets super serious and decides Siri is a major priority, then I could see it morphing into a genuinely useful thing in 4-5 years perhaps. I don't expect it to be anything but the pure suck that it is now for the near future though.	Fendahl_core	t1_dh0eth2

t3_68t5cj	t1_dh1b5jt	1493743789	I used a 4 (no case) for three years and shattered the back twice but never damaged or shattered the screen. It just happens I guess. One nice thing about 4, replacement backs were cheap and took a minute (or less) to replace.	sgt_mustard	t1_dh170t6
t3_68ppqp	t1_dh1bbld	1493743969	The trick is to have low/no expectations, if you can manage it.    I'm being completely serious. I've learned to expect little to nothing from iOS updates. I mostly just hope nothing is made worse and maybe for some bug fixes. Then if they do anything cool and/or useful, it's a pleasant surprise.    It works for me. This time around the only thing I am really hoping for is system-wide dark mode. I can't let that one go. I loathe the acres of eyeball frying white space in iOS. It's one of my least favorite things about it. It is the bane of my existence.   If they add that dark mode and they don't make anything else *worse*, I'll be happy. Anything else is gravy.    I approach the hardware the same way. I think Apple's days of surprising and delighting us are long over. Now it's about predictable, dependable incremental improvements. I have to accept that. So I know, new product is coming. It will be an aluminum rectangle that is a bit better than the one before it. Faster. 20% more of this. 35% more of that. I skip that one and go for the "S" after it that has the bugs from the last one fixed. Simple.    The last time I remember Apple introducing any hardware that actually surprised or impressed me was probably in the mid 2000s maybe(?). The one exception might be the Apple Watch actually. That's an item that reminds me of the old, adventurous Apple. I don't have a desire to own one yet, but I admire Apple for actually taking a little risk and for being a little bold there.	Fendahl_core	t1_dh0h9cv
t3_68ppqp	t1_dh1c6v9	1493744918	You're mostly right. Though a lot of the things the competition adds are things a lot people don't give a shit about. I don't care about the Samsung half-baked gimmick of the week really. If I'm honest, I don't love iOS *or* Android. I use iOS primarily because consistency and the minimum amount of UI lag is more important to me than just about anything else.    The inconsistency, duplication of apps, redundancy, overly busy interface and inevitable lag that everyone swears is gone with every new phone and every revision of Android (but never truly leaves) are all too annoying for me to cope with. iOS has a bunch of annoying compromises too. I just find iOS's compromises easier to tolerate because at least they get the UI smoothness and simplicity right. The customer and software support are second to none too. The extreme lack of customization and boring hardware are rough, but eventually you just start to care less and less about that shit.   The only mobile OS's I came close to really loving are all extinct or on the endangered species list sadly. iOS is a satisfactory concession prize. If we get that long rumored dark mode, that will bump it up a few clicks in my book too.	Fendahl_core	t1_dh0hfir
t3_68ppqp	t1_dh1d4oe	1493745930	How do you know if it's the best overall phone if you've never used anything else?  That's like saying red is the best type of starburst when you've only ever eaten the red ones.	lapotronic	t1_dh0ih99
t3_68t5cj	t1_dh1d8d0	1493746041	Ah I see.   As far as stupid goes, I'd say giving a fuck about what the back of the phone feels like in the 4 seconds out of the box before I put a case on it forever is what would be stupid.   To me it doesn't matter how an iPhone *feels* without a case because Apple has never made a phone that was superficially durable enough for me to feel comfortable using them without a case for a minute. Especially the 6/6+ which is like a damn slippery bar of soap and made of smooth aluminum so the minute it flies out of your hand and hits the concrete it's going be scraped up. It only takes *once*.  I guess some people are focused on that initial out of the box experience. I'm not, since that 4 seconds is a pretty small percentage of time out of the 3-4 years I will use the phone and never touch or see any part of it other than the front. The back could be baby shit green and have a picture of goatse on it and it would make no difference to me because I will never see it. Again, based on what I see around me the majority of other people almost never see or touch the back of their iPhones either.    I'd say making a purchase decision or caring what a part of the phone you never see or touch feels like is about as stupid as it gets.	Fendahl_core	t1_dh19j3l

t3_68t5cj	t1_dh1ks4i	1493754245	Samsung's own processors are far superior to Qualcomm's. Last year, the Samsung-powered Galaxy S7 was much faster than the Qualcomm version theoretically, had nearly 40% better battery life, and was much better optimized in the real world. Things were nearly as quick as an iPhone, whereas the Qualcomm version stuttered, lagged, and delayed to no end.   Samsung would like to sell Exynos processors anywhere, but Qualcomm pressures them into buying their processors for CDMA markets for which they are owed licensing fees. So in the United States and China, Galaxy phones are awful (though this year the gap should be much smaller).   Edit: And as for how they're suing Apple, basically Apple reduced the theoretical speeds of iPhones 7 with Qualcomm modems to match those with an inferior Intel modem. This makes the iPhone 7 a slightly worse performer than the 6s. I think Qualcomm is arguing that by gimping their modems on such a popular product, their reputation has been damaged.	TunakTun633	t1_dh192if
t3_68t5cj	t1_dh1l5k2	1493754653	So you're saying that the entire SoC is worse because one sub-block, the CPU, is slower on Qualcomm than on Exynos? What about everything else on the SoC?	sherifhanna	t1_dh1ks4i
t3_68t5cj	t1_dh1n7wy	1493756928	Back when the 4S was still the newest iPhone, I saw someone sitting on a chair and the phone slid out of their hands and hit their shoe.  The back shattered.  It wasn't more than two or three feet and they were wearing tennis shoes.  I've been using iPhones since the 3G and I won't carry one across the room without a case.  Durability &gt; aesthetics.	TheScutFarkisAffair	t1_dh170t6
t3_68t5cj	t1_dh1padc	1493759192	I dropped my iPhone 4 many times. Never used a case and it took each drop like a champ. No shattered glass. It was durable.      I dropped my iPhone 6S the first week I bought it. Fell out of my pocket as I went to sit in a movie theatre. Screen instantly shattered.      I want the durability of the old phones back.	MarvelsBlackCat	t1_dh170t6
t3_68t5cj	t1_dh1sqzu	1493763916	Not at all! Read the rest of that paragraph. Much important than a theoretical performance delta is a substantial difference in battery life. On ArsTechnica's WebGL test, the difference *was* about 40%. From my real-world experience, that difference isn't far off.   It's also much better performance-optimized. Things feel quicker. Maybe that's Samsung's fault for failing to spend enough time on development for their Snapdragon models, as Google's Pixel carries the same Snapdragon and is pretty darn smooth. But either way, the Exynos Galaxy is the better product and I don't like that Qualcomm pressures Samsung into using their SoCs.   For what little it's worth, there were differences between other sub-blocks. The Exynos model had far superior audio quality. The Qualcomm model had a theoretically superior GPU, though no game can tax either. And of course, through environmental circumstances, only the Qualcomm model had CDMA compatibility.	TunakTun633	t1_dh1l5k2
t3_68t5cj	t1_dh1t6du	1493764485	And more to the point about your initial post, it just hasn't been long enough for that tech to be implemented into phones yet. When they do it, though, I will be ready.	TunakTun633	t1_dh1l5k2
t3_68t5cj	t1_dh1vxay	1493768097	That's really debatable. A lot of people prefer aluminum.	alexbhood	t1_dh18xhq
t3_68t5cj	t1_dh20xwk	1493774335	Well yeah I don't doubt a lot of Apple customers are focused on superficial design elements and get off on the pretty lighting on the iPhone commercial. For me personally a phone that *needs* a case is a negative, not a positive. If Apple can ever find a material and a design they feel is satisfactorily sexy but can actually be carried without a case by most people and not look like shit after a year, that will be a great day.    The only phones I've had that met that description were Blackberries, a Palm OS phone and my Nokia Lumia 920. I know probably no one here will agree, but I still think tough polycarbonate is by far the most practical material to make a phone out of.   That's one thing I'll never forgive Apple for. Before the iPhone came along, no one would even dream of making a phone that can't survive a few drops to the ground and needs a case on it constantly like it's a fabrege egg.    There's definitely a way to make a smartphone that feels nice in your hand but doesn't need a case. That Lumia I had is proof. 2 years with no case and it got dropped more than a couple of times and had nothing but a tiny dent on one corner to show for it. An iPhone would have been ravaged under the same conditions without a case.	Fendahl_core	t1_dh1fs8o

t3_68t5cj	t1_dh27arb	1493782333	Holy shit you know I would bet this is what the phone will have! Almost any kind of tech Apple uses is demostared and used in a early product then perfected for a bigger product.

t3_68t5cj	t1_dh28fp0	1493783962	That's a very good point you brought up! It is true that Apple uses early tech then perfects it.

t3_68kz10	t1_dh2mans	1493815890	The charging circuitry is in the phone, not in the power brick. The phone will decide how much power it will draw from the charger, not the spec of the charger.

t3_692yty	t1_dh3boz9	1493844308	If he was still in Airplane Mode, the only way I know a text message would have been sent is if, once connect to WiFi, it also connected to WiFi calling. Depending on carrier, WiFi Calling will also route text messages over the WiFi network.	ZB370	t3_692yty
t3_692yty	t1_dh3cv68	1493845584	Specifically for AT&amp;T, here is the page that mentions text over WiFi:  https://www.att.com/shop/wireless/features/wifi-calling.html	puffyreddthat	t1_dh3boz9
t3_692yty	t1_dh3d1st	1493845798	Oh okay, but there would be no charge right? Since his phone was on airplane mode and on wifi. I just want to make sure turning cellular and roaming off, keeping airplane mode on, and using wifi only will guarantee no international charges because the rates are crazy.	xsimplicityy	t1_dh3boz9
t3_692yty	t1_dh3d2ej	1493845817	I use Verizon, but I'll check the link out. Thanks!	xsimplicityy	t1_dh3cv68
t3_692yty	t1_dh3f7qq	1493848273	If the cellular radio stays off, it has nothing to do with the cellular provider i.e. no charge.   If you are that worried, 1. talk to Verizon. I don't know about them, but I just got back from a trip to the UK and with Sprint I had free 2G (slow) data, free text messages, and $0.35 per minute calls.  2. If push comes to shove and you don't believe anything, take your SIM card out. Then it can't connect to a cellular network.	ZB370	t1_dh3d1st

t3_691bpv	t1_dh3fvrw	1493849089	No kidding haha. I'm not sure what happened because the app was working totally fine yesterday morning/throughout the day. Then all the sudden it stopped working last night and it's still not working today. The app did not update either. I can confirm that. But I'm not sure. Anyway the iOS on the phone is 10.2.1  and I haven't downloaded any new apps recently. I did a few weeks ago, but the app was still working fine with no issues.	MNightShyamalan69	t1_dh30ih1
t3_691al6	t1_dh3g2pu	1493849334	Here is a pic of the front along with the front skin that came with the kit: http://i.imgur.com/Wkn4NL8.jpg The texture of the skin is similar to the old tan plastic they used, which I thought was cool	Everlong916	t1_dh349oe
t3_691al6	t1_dh3g40t	1493849380	here's the front: http://i.imgur.com/Wkn4NL8.jpg the buttons on the side are not covered, but I'm fine with that look lol	Everlong916	t1_dh3fl7h
t3_691al6	t1_dh3g4ji	1493849397	here's the front: http://i.imgur.com/Wkn4NL8.jpg I also have the matte black, but I hope it doesn't ruin the finish. I've had skins in the past, and none of them have changed the phone's finish.	Everlong916	t1_dh390gm
t3_691al6	t1_dh3g8rp	1493849545	It took some work to line up the skin, but you can re-set it multiple times without loosing any adhesion. I definitely recommend using a hair dryer to get the sides to stick!	Everlong916	t1_dh32gqw

t3_692yty	t1_dh3j4gv	1493853174	Yes but it will ensure that the message does not revert to SMS in the event of data failure on either end. Especially since you will not be connected to wifi 100%. Trust me on this one.	perry1023	t1_dh3j1if

t3_691bpv	t1_dh3jame	1493853395	What's the app?   Clear all current notifications. And restart again. There is a collision occurring somewhere in the iOS that is causing unwanted performance.	perry1023	t1_dh3j7jh
t3_692yty	t1_dh3jr3k	1493853976	Oh okay, yeah that will definitely ensure I won't get any charges due to messages. As long as I'm always on airplane mode, I also shouldn't though right?   Thanks btw!	xsimplicityy	t1_dh3j4gv

t3_696eyc	t1_dh46tme	1493896465	I turn them all off. What that does is letting apps refresh their content in the background once in a while so when you open them you see new content immediately. I have no use for that. It takes like half a second for them to load when I open an app anyway.  This also doesn't affect push notifications or email or anything.	Yo_2T	t3_696eyc
t3_696eyc	t1_dh46ugt	1493896521	Why do you think that turns it into a flip phone?  FYI it doesn't. The phone functions fine with background app refresh off.	Yo_2T	t1_dh46ira
t3_696eyc	t1_dh46y8a	1493896769	Because without having things auto refresh you lose allot of functionality in that your always having to manually check mail etc. In 2017 the phone should run well without having to turn stuff off. I keep all mine on and the battery life is great.	savoy2001	t3_696eyc
t3_696eyc	t1_dh47drj	1493897751	I tried to have only certain apps refresh in the background, but iOS wants to turn them all on after a while. So I turned them all off.	SprSynJn	t3_696eyc

t3_696eyc	t1_dh4b16s	1493904067	No that's not true. Mine is always off and I can assure you I get more emails than I'd like to see on my phone. Auto refresh off doesn't affect push notifications, email and the likes.	Yo_2T	t1_dh46y8a
t3_691al6	t1_dh4birx	1493904747	Would these effectively help protect your phone? If so I would buy one.	pwnedkiller	t3_691al6
t3_692yty	t1_dh4bu2y	1493905165	That should be a pretty easy test. Go in to airplane mode, connect to Wifi (without wifi calling turned on) and have someone try to iMessage your phone number. if I recall, you do still get iMessages but its easy to double check that	ZB370	t1_dh3j3rt
t3_696eyc	t1_dh4d28u	1493906738	Theory: it depends on whether you turned BAR on while connected to Internet or not. Kind of the same thing when Music will always start on the same song whenever you shuffle.	khromechronicle	t1_dh47drj

It also only works for apps that are suspended in task switcher, if you're like me and close most of your apps when you're finished with them, BAR won't do anything (yes, I know closing them all is "bad", but I prefer to keep the task switcher tidy).	newfonehudis	t3_696eyc
t3_696eyc	t1_dh4idvq	1493912807	Generally all off except for my AdBlock and data plan app, just to make sure it registers usage correctly.

t3_696eyc	t1_dh4tt9k	1493924872	Yeah I never saw the point of it either. If iOS had live tiles/widgets like active content on the home screen I can see the need. If I am going to have to do anything more than the single step of opening the phone to get to the data, then it might as well stay dormant and update after I tap tap tap swipe tap to get to it.    I know it will never happen, but I wish to fuck that Apple would make their own rip-off of the Windows Phone live tile screen. Best homescreen design ever. It's the ideal UI for a homescreen IMO. Presents all of your infomation at a glance and you can resize and position the tiles in any way you like according to their importance to you. People who haven't used it for a while don't even know. When it comes to the homescreen, I feel like I stepped back into 1997 Palm Pilot days using my iPhone compared to the WP homescreen. I've been using iOS for 3 years and still feel that way. Please Apple, do something with the fucking homescreen already...but I digress.	Fendahl_core	t1_dh46tme
t3_694g43	t1_dh4tyli	1493925033	Yep. And all of Apple's support and the genius bar and the entire internet couldn't figure out what the problem was.	trez63	t1_dh44xmz
t3_696eyc	t1_dh4u078	1493925082	&gt; Because without having things auto refresh you lose allot of functionality  No you don't.   You're always at least two taps or a swipe or more away from doing anything useful in iOS anyway. 99% of the icons convey no active information. It usually takes 1 second or so for any app I use to update itself. There's virtually no difference in practical use that I've ever noticed, but I did notice a bump in battery life when I turned all that nonsense off.	Fendahl_core	t1_dh46y8a
t3_696eyc	t1_dh4yms2	1493930040	on so when I go back into apps it remembers where I was. example: Instagram always forgets my place on my feed if I have background app refresh off, so I always keep it on.	cat-litter	t3_696eyc
t3_696eyc	t1_dh552sx	1493937629	There is 0 reason for them to be off. If they are off, you don't understand how iOS works.	Metriacanthosaurus	t3_696eyc
t3_696eyc	t1_dh55xru	1493938763	Background refresh gets a bad rap. It has very little effect on battery life.  Apps just can't refresh in the background "whenever they feel like it".  The app can specify what they'd like as a minimum refresh time, but the system doesn't guarantee it.  The iPhone will cull the background requests and will usually send them when the wifi and/or cell radios are already on (ie, you wake up your phone to check Facebook; the system sees that it's connected to the internet and then performs the background app refreshes).

t3_69j2u7	t1_dh717kj	1494043198	Keepass with MiniKeePass. You keep control of your passwords and can sync to the cloud if you want. I use a key file and a password to decrypt my passwords.	gotlactose	t3_69j2u7

t3_69j2u7	t1_dh75363	1494050911	LastPass has had a number of vulnerabilities lately, but haven't lost any passwords (yet).  I use 1Password. Yes, it's subscription-based, but it's proven the most solid password manager from a security standpoint for many years.	clefmeister	t3_69j2u7
t3_69j2u7	t1_dh75c6m	1494051489	Thanks, but a subscription based password manager for me is irrelevant for my finance, so I free solution is what I'm looking for.	BMWi8S	t1_dh75363
t3_69j2u7	t1_dh75pl9	1494052408	You could always go with iCloud Keychain, but it's not as robust or proven as the other password managers.	clefmeister	t1_dh75c6m
t3_69j2u7	t1_dh75pze	1494052435	But does it less or more secure than 3rd party app?	BMWi8S	t1_dh75pl9
t3_69j2u7	t1_dh766i1	1494053559	It uses 256-bit AES encryption, which is the same as 1Password and LastPass. So, it's got the same level of security, as far as keeping your passwords safe from being decrypted.  If you also plan on using it to generate passwords, note that iCloud Keychain's password generate seems to only use '-' as a symbol, whereas other password managers use randomly selected symbols. Hence, I'd say the password generation tool in other password managers is more secure.	clefmeister	t1_dh75pze

t3_69j2u7	t1_dh77m76	1494057729	No, you should be okay.

Do you know if phone carriers can temporarily block any chance of receiving SMS texts?	xsimplicityy	t1_dh4bu2y
t3_69n8ka	t1_dh7uyu0	1494101759	Not everyone has iPhones. 80% of the phones out there are Android phones.

t3_69n8ka	t1_dh7visn	1494102538	You can if those people have an SMS plan, though you're then limited to the featureset provided by SMS and miss out on the additions that something Whatsapp offers (like encryption).  But that's the thing, Whatsapp is popular outside of the US because most people don't have SMS plans.	redavid	t1_dh7vcn3
t3_69n8ka	t1_dh82xdz	1494113476	Here in Holland we pretty much abandoned sms. We used to get a limited amount of sms's to send each month. To avoid going over the limit we started using the Internet to send each other messages. Even though we have unlimited sms in our current plans we never use it.   So it's not the features that made WhatsApp popular. It was "free" texting in a time when texting was expensive that made it popular.	JD_Hammond	t3_69n8ka
t3_69n8ka	t1_dh841o6	1494115162	That's what I'm picking up. We dropped SMS packages in the US a while ago which is why I was not really understanding the benefit of having Whatsapp over it.

t3_69n8ka	t1_dh843iu	1494115238	I'll talk why we use what's app in the Middle East, what's is faster than Sms, Sms isn't free, you can send broadcast with more than 160 character in less than a second, you can have a group chat with people that are using iOS, Android, &amp; computers. You can share videos &amp; voice notes easily. All of this features aren't free in the Middle East &amp; you have to pay for each message you send. In addition, you make a voice calls.  I hope that people will switch to telegram because you can use it on Android &amp; iOS &amp; have all your media with you unlike WhatsApp.	bfk1010	t3_69n8ka

t3_69n8ka	t1_dh85xpu	1494118048	Cross platform iMessage equivalent. Pretty self evident why it's so popular - Android phones represent the majority of the market, and iMessage only functions from iOS to iOS. When you text an Android user it isn't iMessage, it's just an SMS.   As a techie with predominantly techie friends, I only have one friend who uses iMessage. Pretty much everyone else uses WhatsApp and Telegram as well as BBM, Facebook Messenger (blargh), Discord and even Skype (ugh).	DatDeLorean	t3_69n8ka

t3_69n8ka	t1_dh8jncc	1494144350	I work in a teaching hospital in the United States. Terrible reception within the building. We use WhatsApp because it works with the wifi but SMS does not. People have iPhones and Androids. WhatsApp is the app of choice amongst our physicians because other people were already using it and it's easy to add new people.   Please note, as the others have said already, iMessages does not work between iPhones and Androids. It's all the same to the iPhone other than blue vs. green text bubbles, but they work based on different technologies.	gotlactose	t3_69n8ka

t3_69s72i	t1_dh909b8	1494178685	I have Private Internet Access for my VPN. I use it whenever I connect to any public wifi network for extra privacy and security, since connecting to a public wifi without a VPN is just begging someone to log your activity.  It's cheap and it doesn't slow down your phone at all. I only use PIA because it's cheap and easy, but there are plenty of choices for VPN provider depending on your needs.	Riash	t3_69s72i
t3_69n8ka	t1_dh90hej	1494178999	95% of the people I know use Android so it's practically impossible for me to use iMessage instead of WhatsApp. Here in Italy iPhones are expensive as hell, they're indeed considered almost a luxury object however I believe it depends on where you live: All my japanese friends have an iPhone but they use LINE instead of iMessage. So chinese people do with WeChat.   I wish I could use iMessage just as I do with Whatsapp.. It feels faster, cleaner, now funnier (stickers and apps) and has that iOS vibe that I like a lot.	Bishibazu	t3_69n8ka
t3_69s72i	t1_dh91imi	1494180374	I'm using CactusVPN. It encrypts your traffic so ISPs and other people can't see what you do. No, it won't slow your phone down, but internet speeds can be slower depending on which server you use.  Also, I recommend staying away from free VPNs such as Hotspot Shield and much more. They are garbage ones that sell your data. If you aren't paying for it, you're the product.	skinnymemedude22	t3_69s72i
t3_69s72i	t1_dh9egei	1494196693	I'm currently trying our NordVPN. Haven't really been sold on it as of yet. It kicks me off randomly during use. It also kicks me off when phone is put to sleep. Have problems connecting to servers a lot as well.	thepyro395	t3_69s72i
t3_69s72i	t1_dh9fm32	1494198302	I think the problem stems from the recent senate vote on net neutrality, and now people are flocking to NordVPN in droves, overwhelming the servers. Your best bet might be to use a different VPN.	skinnymemedude22	t1_dh9egei
t3_69s72i	t1_dh9gg13	1494199461	I have been using ExpressVPN. It's not cheap (I paid $100 for the year), but it has worked really well for me. Very fast, doesn't drop connections, good customer service. I also like that they don't log and are not based in the U.S.	Wdc331	t3_69s72i

t3_694g43	t1_dh9jx6h	1494204297	Agreed. But many apps make this mistake and if you can't figure out why your backups are so large then this is the best way I found to find the culprit.	trez63	t1_dh9jh5t

t3_69n8ka	t1_dhac7g2	1494257064	Within the US, I personally think whatsapp is pretty useless as almost all carriers now provide unlimited texting. When you're traveling, whatsapp becomes a little more convenient as it communicates through the internet rather than a carrier and given the added multi-platform compatibility it makes it a lot more convenient than imessage.   Of course whatsapp is useless if you don't mind paying the extra $$ from roaming charges and international texting	Ehwic	t1_dh841o6

t3_69yxdn	t1_dham0km	1494268107	I mean, I understand all if that. I would think the FBI would have an interest in making this a quick process, especially when it's a terrorism investigation.   That said, I think the Supreme Court needs to rule in the near future on whether a warrant has to be obtained before breaking into someone's phone. I'm sure they will. But I don't blame the FBI for trying to get into a phone as quick as possible.	UKFan643	t1_dhal7hs
t3_69yxdn	t1_dham0ye	1494268118	.. Almost - it takes time out of the equation, but not money. They spent money so they didn't have to spend time. The person selling the tool priced it according.	i_am_the_xr	t1_dhal7hs

t3_69yxdn	t1_dhamrvg	1494268959	Sure, that part was. But they found another way. Their decision to purchase a tool outside of Apple has nothing to do with Apple.

t3_69yxdn	t1_dhamw4z	1494269095	Actually, law enforcement said it at the time because the terrorist was using a separate phone for his non-work activities.  They wanted to be "thorough".    Also, they said what other cases they wanted to use the capability for and none of them (to my knowledge) were terrorism related.  They were drug and pornography cases IIRC.	ChocolateSunrise	t1_dhams7u
t3_69yxdn	t1_dhaoihd	1494270884	Again, I'm not arguing that they have interests beyond this singular case. I'm saying that in this singular case, it makes perfect sense they would procure the tool to unlock the phone. Of course they would. They would be negligent if they didn't.	UKFan643	t1_dhamw4z
t3_69yxdn	t1_dhaor5w	1494271150	And I am saying they didn't go to this length for numerous other cases in which they claim the same authority (which currently legally nebulous).  They waited until they had a terrorism case to fight this publicly.    And honestly, if this issue in the iPhone 5c wasn't discovered it is possible this would have been a case headed to the Supreme Court to decide whether companies can provide truly secure technology to clients or if the government can require a backdoor.    And while that has personal privacy implications the bigger concern is how that would harm American brands overseas.  Our tech may soon be seen as always insecure.	ChocolateSunrise	t1_dhaoihd

t3_69yxdn	t1_dhaptnb	1494272303	&gt;  I can't blame law enforcement for doing everything they can.

t3_69yxdn	t1_dhb2f5q	1494287222	That's simply not true. Unlocking one phone one time does not mean Apple would be forced to do it for an unlimited number of phones.  Stop believing everything you read online.	ryankearney	t1_dhatpnx
t3_69yxdn	t1_dhb3o5n	1494288863	It has to do with the Secure Enclave, which is a hardware encryption chip. It prevents the encryption key from being extracted by just cloning the contents of the flash storage. This was introduced with the 5s along with TouchID.	AlphaAnt	t1_dhayrj2
t3_69yxdn	t1_dhb3oqo	1494288884	You're either impossibly stupid or intentionally ignorant. Either way, you're completely wrong.   Once any agency had the tool, or Apple had been forced to use the tool, a precedent would have been set for unlimited future use, effectively making the use of this type of encryption, the last line of defense in personal digital security today, effectively useless against the government. This could not be allowed to happen, and was, unquestionably, unconstitutional.   Apple, namely Tim Cook, not only knew that, but was willing to go to the Supreme Court to defend it-- and they were seemingly the only major company willing to do so-- Microsoft, Google, all the major players had back doors in their platforms but Apple. And Apple has closed the hole the FBI used to get in, and added levels of magnitude greater security since.   Say what you want about Apple, but they stared down the big, bad US Government in the name of encryption and independent security and won for us all.	OkToBeTakei	t1_dhb2f5q

Record_Was_Correct	t1_dhb4t3g
t3_69yxdn	t1_dhb78ig	1494293577	OH I GET IT!  Okay, the disconnect may be due to your being used to a judicial system outside the USA.  In USA, laws don't exist until a test case is used to build up a precedent. The first time a ruling on a particular type of case goes a certain way, it is referenced from then on as an exemplar on how future rulings should be conducted.  In this manner, the rule of law is built up like a mighty stone wall, one solid piece of stonework -- one case -- at a time. You can't just go willy nilly expecting precedent to have no effect, because that's literally the opposite of how the rule of law is expected to be applied.  Other countries do things differently, but this system appears to work pretty well in USA.	jinxjar	t1_dhb4t3g

t3_69yxdn	t1_dhb7xke	1494294458	So do you, considering you seem to think a company assisting with one investigation will compel them to assist with 100% of future cases.

t3_69yxdn	t1_dhb84x0	1494294725	So it's not so much that literally every case involving a phone will by default be unlocked, however if there was a tool and it was used in a court case before the prosecution could ask for an order to unlock the phone in every case going forward.   So it's not a default that every case WILL by default, but the fact that every case CAN going forward, and there is a good chance that they will ask and be granted that ability.	cosmicsans	t1_dhb7eez

t3_69yxdn	t1_dhbokko	1494329774	To oversimplify, the only legal argument Apple has is that they actually don't have access to the phone. They can't be asked to do the impossible, so they can legally not follow the warrant.   If they create a backdoor, or reveal one which already existed, not only does that come with all the normal security issues a backdoor causes, but it also takes away their argument that they *can't* do it, meaning they would have to follow *all* future warrants unless they want to be found in contempt every time someone with an iPhone commits a serious crime   tl;dr: if Apple decrypted the phone, it would take away the only defense they have from future warrants (which is basically saying "guys we literally cannot do this")	legobmw99	t1_dhb3yph

So we cannot manage their AppleID or reset it.  Things we can manage; Exchange Account, Some restrictions (like iCloud drive use), VPN Settings, Wi-Fi Network, Domains, Certificates.

t3_69yxdn	t1_dhbr6ul	1494334590	That makes sense. I suspect I'm thinking back quite a while when there were managed Apple IDs and I remember reading about those and thinking it was an odd system whatever it was!	Rosydoodles	t1_dhbqwss

t3_6a2d83	t1_dhbs1lq	1494335908	Can you use Next to jump to the iPhone then pay it all off early? That way you trade in your Galaxy and no longer have to worry about monthly payments.	PavelDatsyuk	t3_6a2d83
t3_6a1v7g	t1_dhbu03k	1494338552	Uh, no. You can do it in 2 steps by buying a tone from the iTunes Store.  This is a tutorial for how to MAKE YOUR OWN ringtone using the editing tools in Garage Band and songs from your Apple Music Library. Obviously that requires a few steps to EDIT AUDIO.	Metriacanthosaurus	t1_dhbqnlo
t3_6a2d83	t1_dhbwith	1494341605	I probably could, but when i check if I have an upgrade it just tells me I don't have one at this time. Normally it says after x months you can upgrade or trade in and pay Y, but nothing right now 🤔	LaLechuga94	t1_dhbs1lq
t3_6a1v7g	t1_dhbwjtw	1494341636	Yeah, but why do you want to buy a ringtone online when it's legally available to download on YouTube?  It's certainly possible to import custom ringtones into GarageBand.   Plus, your still supporting the creator on YouTube unless your using Adblock.   Free &gt;&gt; $2.99	devopia	t1_dhbu03k
t3_6a2d83	t1_dhbx77b	1494342388	Did you ever send your Galaxy in for repairs or replacement? Sometimes this messes with your upgrade eligibility.	PavelDatsyuk	t1_dhbwith
t3_6a1v7g	t1_dhbxs21	1494343045	As a long-time Android user, this was one of my first surprises when I bought my iPhone. I used to use ringdroid to open an audio file, get precisely the clip I wanted, and then export as either a ringtone or notification.  This is similarly close to that. The steps are different, but the process is similar. Get file -&gt; open + edit file -&gt; Export results. Sure this feels more cumbersome because Garageband is fairly huge, but I'm glad to see there *is* an option.  edit: spelling	zakataku	t1_dhbqnlo

t3_69eoug	t1_dhc3j2f	1494349407	I've tried your app, I think the idea might be neat. It really depends on having fun users around you though. I had no users anywhere nearby it seemed and worldwide just saw people posting things like "sexchat?" so there's no point in using the worldwide feature for me. The interface is also pretty ugly, the icon is terrible, and it crashed on me several times. Good luck to you, I do think it's a nice idea, just seems like it might be a few years late.

t3_6aakza	t1_dhd1nz5	1494389982	I had the galaxy s2 when I was studying at a university. Back then phones have really small screens but I managed to do some editing on my phone regardless (not drafting, mind you, that is close to impossible).  So I would say the SE would work fine. But obviously having a bigger screen helps, a lot.   I used my iPad for writing papers when I returned to study last year, and it does make a difference.   So it all comes down to what you are actually doing (editing vs drafting). Personally, if you say you would be drafting papers, forget the SE, forget the 6s also. Just use a PC, or buy yourself a laptop.     Edit: You guys downvoting because I mentioned S2 or what? If so, no wonder people call us Apple Sheep...	naeads	t3_6aakza

But I dont't use my phone that often (with the only exception when I was still owning a galaxy Note 7, that thing was just perfect).  If not, I would just recommend to go for a 6 if you are doing anything MORE than just editing.	naeads	t1_dhd1rvg

t3_6aakza	t1_dhd76ty	1494402135	Let me tell you why you should care about 3D Touch.   &gt; I like SE's design, but I often type college papers my phone and I fear that screen may be too small.   If this is true then 3D Touch is huge for you. I have the 6S and my single favorite thing about 3D Touch is the fact that I can lightly 3D Touch the keyboard and hold to drag around the cursor. A harder Press selects the text for you.	dollahbill_	t1_dhd1tic
t3_6abd0k	t1_dhd7fe5	1494402822	Oh, yes, I'm an idiot. I don't think there's another way besides using QuickTime on macOS.   Edit: Does your screen take no input at all? Because if so, I don't think any method is possible. I was going to suggest using a Lightning to HDMI adapter (or whatever is applicable for your monitor) but you still need an input method.	icystorm	t1_dhd77xx

The 6 is going to be left behind a lot sooner than the 6S because the 6S was such a leap in raw power on the hardware level. The 6 also only has 1GB of RAM and that is going to be painful soon if it's not already.	PavelDatsyuk	t3_6aakza

t3_6ac4na	t1_dhds37s	1494436561	ah glad you seeing some stuff and many thanks for the help its a difficult app to test! We only show one day at a time which does mean in some places you wont see much. Thats a deliberate choice as there is no point on showing stuff you cant make it to anyway. Saying that i'm seeing lots in NY on any day. Make sure you turn off all the filters in the Do tab as that will narrow down what you see a lot. Oh and we are working on adding more stuff	tjsdavies	t1_dhdqi0y

t3_6ae607	t1_dhdzmqr	1494444500	Do you use Antenna as a reddit client? I used to, but it got to where it was draining my battery horribly. Had to switch to Narwhal.	o_g	t3_6ae607
t3_6ae607	t1_dhe0mgj	1494445511	Your phone is almost 3 years old, and you expect the battery to perform well? Apple tells you how many charge cycles you'll get from their batteries and they're usually not far off, my guess is you're leaps and bounds past what they recommend and your battery is probably swelling up. I would get a new phone instead of battery, you can find a 6s for like $300 on Swappa. The 6 chipset is just super slow now and you're going to be running into more problems soon if you keep it.	BasedGodTbh	t3_6ae607
t3_6ae607	t1_dhe0sp6	1494445689	I use Narwhal as well, I honestly never suspected a Reddit app to be a culprit of battery drainage.	fire__ant	t1_dhdzmqr
t3_6ae607	t1_dhe15gu	1494446064	Yes, I realize my phone is nearly 3 years old and definitely expected less battery power over time. I definitely wasn't expecting the battery to be in top shape at this point in time. With that being said, I find the battery drainage quite severe, which is why I wanted more input from you folks. But hey what do I know, this is my first iPhone and I don't have any ideas of how long these phones generally last!   I'm considering upgrading to a 7+, and if the iPhone 8 is a major improvement I'll sell the 7+ and grab the 8.	fire__ant	t1_dhe0mgj
t3_6ae607	t1_dhe1b0x	1494446232	I just got the battery replaced on my 6s+. Now it's working a lot more like it used to when I first got the phone.	dmaxel	t3_6ae607
t3_6ae607	t1_dhe2cp8	1494447355	Good to know, I'm leaning towards that or getting an upgrade. I'd love to hold out until the iPhone 8 comes out but that seems very unlikely.	fire__ant	t1_dhe1b0x
t3_6ae607	t1_dhe2sha	1494447821	As someone who jumped from a 6 to a 7+, totally worth it.	Aarondo99	t1_dhe15gu
t3_6ae607	t1_dhe31pu	1494448091	&gt;Do all iPhone's decide to conk out around the 2/3 year mark?  Most all smartphone, laptop, and gadget batteries, yeah. After about 2 years they work about half as well compared to a new battery. Many will have issues where they drain even faster or have issues staying on or being stable.  It's just a normal thing to need a battery replacement every 2- 3 years. Some go longer, but that's average. The unfortunate thing is that most phones no longer have a battery that's easy for the user to replace.  Apple can replace the battery for about $80. 3rd party repair places can do it for less.	my02	t3_6ae607

t3_6ae607	t1_dhe50bu	1494450182	Ah I see, I wasn't aware this was your first iPhone. For future reference, your original battery should be pretty shot after 2 years on almost any phone.	BasedGodTbh	t1_dhe15gu

t3_6aakza	t1_dheaymz	1494457411	I kind of like ultra portability though.  I think the SE is super sexy.  But I fear I may get buyers remorse when trying to watch movies or type long documents.  So maybe the 6s is a good in between.  However, the plus iPhones are still smaller than the phablets, so it can't be that bad.	stamina888	t1_dhe7quf
t3_694g43	t1_dhec8e5	1494459099	Oh not arguing at all. Just putting the blame on the app developer and not Apple. They give devs the tools but they don't use them sometimes.   The only way to really tell is to use an iTunes backup and use one of those apps that let you explore the backup file - like iMazing for example.	tsdguy	t1_dh9jx6h

t3_6agx5v	t1_dhf0nc9	1494504458	Generally, no there aren't. Android OEMs wisely chose iPhone battery life over iPhone size. If you do get a phone that isn't large or huge that isn't an iPhone or iPhone SE, it won't work on Verizon, so if you're outside the US it's fine, but if you're in the US, it means you have to settle for shit coverage for a more comfortable form factor.   I wish I'd gotten a 64GB SE instead of the 128GB 6s (I fucking love the 5s design) but i wouldn't trade down. Show me an SE that feels like a 7, has 128GB, and the camera from the 6s/7, and the touch ID from the 7, Taptic Engine, and force touch, and I'm in.	dragontology	t1_dheqsts

t3_6agx5v	t1_dhf0xjj	1494504975	Don't feel too bad. If you don't mind the 4" screen size (or even like it), the SE is an great smartphone that has amazing performance.	Switchfoot221	t1_dhf03l3

t3_6agx5v	t1_dhf32u1	1494508443	&gt; has 128GB  New SE's already have 128 GB :) And their camera is from 6s.	Shadow647	t1_dhf0nc9
t3_6agx5v	t1_dhf3dli	1494508869	I heard those were coming. And I meant (and should have said) the front camera. I know the back camera is the same, but they downgraded the camera on the front and that's kind of disappointing.	dragontology	t1_dhf32u1
t3_6agx5v	t1_dhf45f5	1494509927	I think the iPhone 6-esque size is perect for a "smaller" phone.  If they can shrink the bezels that would be fine and I'm definitely all for a solid glass phone.  I wish they'd return to flat sides, though.  The 4/4s design was my favorite with a close second to the 5/5s design.  I favor flat sides over the curved design of the iPhone 6-7 phones.	scrizewly	t3_6agx5v

t3_6agx5v	t1_dhf6vzg	1494513336	The point of the SE is that it's not meant to be a flagship phone...	stromm	t1_dhf0nc9
t3_6agx5v	t1_dhf71l2	1494513515	I traded from a 5S to SE over a year ago. Didn't know they had modified it since then.  But I am very happy with it. It's faster than the 5S and is great for what it is meant for, that being "mostly a phone/txt" device.    The larger phones are just too big and too expensive.  I only paid $20 to get the SE, without trade-in.	stromm	t1_dhepoqr

t3_6akjr6	t1_dhf8v8h	1494515576	Theoretically, any part of the phone can be replaced. If screen is broken and that's the issue, they can plug in a replacement screen. If it's the battery, they can plug in a new battery. As long as it's not the actual board itself, they should be able to recover the data on the phone. I don't know how they can actually download the voice mails, but at the very least you can probably just record them with a microphone.	andysaurus_rex	t1_dhf8pjp
t3_6akjr6	t1_dhf934e	1494515820	The screen is broken, not sure if that was the issue. I'll take it to an Apple iPhone store and get a verdict and do what I need to from there. Thanks for the advice! I've never dealt with an iPhone.	LexieFTW	t1_dhf8v8h
t3_6akjr6	t1_dhf96b1	1494515917	I thought voicemails were held on the phone company's servers. If that is right, putting the SIM card into another phone would work. Best luck anyway, I really hope he gets access to them.	Flugzeugler	t3_6akjr6

Honestly, I wasn't interested in getting a new phone right this second because either I will want an 8, I won't like the 8 but then the 7s will be cheaper. Seemed like a better choice to pay the $79 right now for the next few months. I sort of looked at it as $16 a month to lease my phone until I saw what else was out there.

t3_6akjr6	t1_dhfy5zx	1494543281	This.  Usually voicemails are stored on the carriers server. When he accesses his voicemail from another phone it should be there.	giganticprune	t1_dhf96b1
t3_6akjr6	t1_dhfyqma	1494544018	Was the phone backed up to iTunes? If so, you should be able to recover them from the computer.	kings4la	t3_6akjr6
t3_6akjr6	t1_dhfyzj4	1494544350	If you can revive the iPhone, and if he had Visual Voicemail, the messages will still be there until the device is wiped. That would be my fear; that the Genius or other repair tech would wipe and restore the device.  Assuming you meet all of the "if's" -- if it's reparable, if it had Visual Voicemail, and if the repair tech doesn't wipe the device -- then you can use something like iMazing to download the voicemails.	clefmeister	t3_6akjr6
t3_6alrol	t1_dhfz707	1494544624	Wunderlist is going away (Microsoft bought it), so don't go with that one. [Microsoft To-Do](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-to-do/id1212616790?mt=8) is decent, but kinda limited right now. It's being developed by the same folks who brought Wunderlist, which was my favorite other than OmniFocus until MS bought the company. I'd say it's still worth a look, since it seems to be getting new features and bug-fixes pretty regularly.	clefmeister	t3_6alrol
t3_6amxsl	t1_dhfz8u9	1494544691	Nice. One thing I used a lot on Android.	MrRiggs	t3_6amxsl
t3_6alrol	t1_dhfzw5r	1494545554	Cool. I'll check t out. Does his mean wunderlist will no longer work or what? Would you recommend checking Omni focus now or not? Tnx	DoctorQuinlan	t1_dhfz707
t3_6alrol	t1_dhg01f4	1494545753	Omni Focus is great if you have a lot of projects to manage. Most people don't. It's a paid app, too, which is a big deterrent.  Wunderlist will eventually be removed from the App Store, I presume. At the very least, updates for it will dry up. You are definitely best advised to choose something that's still in active development, which Wunderlist isn't :( I have some hope, though, that MS To-Do will become as good as Wunderlist.	clefmeister	t1_dhfzw5r
t3_6amxsl	t1_dhg01y6	1494545773	Nice! It looks super clean and easy to use. You should send me a free download... for "testing" purposes! ; )	TyCox	t3_6amxsl

t3_6alrol	t1_dhg0ti1	1494546831	Yep, they introduced a new to do app called, To Do, and will be shutting Wunderlist down for good. http://www.pcmag.com/news/353185/microsoft-retiring-wunderlist-pushing-new-to-do-app	tmazon	t1_dhfvqe2
t3_6anxdi	t1_dhg105g	1494547089	What do you guys think of this battery test? I think Apple will really need to step up its game in the iPhone 8. ﻿If the iPhone doesn't change this year, unfortunately, some of us might change to Samsung.	jackalope10101	t3_6anxdi
t3_6alrol	t1_dhg1xwa	1494548376	This might be a dumb question but does that mean even if I have it on my phone and Mac, it won't work? I imagine it won't sync but might work on my phone only and Mac only.	DoctorQuinlan	t1_dhg0ti1
t3_6alrol	t1_dhg20jy	1494548476	I doubt they will work as they still ping the servers. You could try airplane mode on your phone and see if it still works? And yes, sync will most definitely not work.	tmazon	t1_dhg1xwa
t3_6alrol	t1_dhg20tw	1494548487	I want to like it but it seems very limited if you don't want to pay. I'd be okay with a small one time fee but don't want a subscription. Do you use paid?  I've been messing with it all day. Nice layout. Seems you can't change the due date of many at a time. And can't comment on tasks. Could be wrong tho.	DoctorQuinlan	t1_dhg1wkb
t3_6alrol	t1_dhg23gl	1494548589	I got the free one month trial and after using it for 3 weeks I got my karma upgrade which gave me 6 months free. I just got another karma upgrade today actually and got another 6 months free lol.	Hallow201	t1_dhg20tw

t3_6alrol	t1_dhg2951	1494548807	Nah. Might as well switch now. I imagine in ten years tho, it'd be fun to look back at all the things I accomplished and how stupid some were. Hopefully that will still work lol.	DoctorQuinlan	t1_dhg20jy
t3_6alrol	t1_dhg2ca5	1494548926	You earn Karma by competing tasks, assigning projects and tags, etc. Basically for using all of the functions. After each "level up" you get two codes for three months of premium. No one says you can't use both so...	tmazon	t1_dhg27xk
t3_6alrol	t1_dhg2djz	1494548974	I actually use Todoist. It's pretty streamlined and works on everything. I pay for premium but it's not bad at all, at $28 a year.	tmazon	t1_dhg2951

t3_6amxsl	t1_dhg3so1	1494550861	I just bought this because I'm colourblind and it's actually amazing. There's similar apps on the App Store, but they're either garbage or outdated. You should post this on /r/ColorBlind.	dontbesuchajerry	t3_6amxsl

t3_6anxdi	t1_dhg5cq2	1494552957	I used the S8+ for a couple of weeks and I would say the battery life is about the same. My iPhone even had about 8 months of wear and tear on it too.	crisss1205	t3_6anxdi

t3_6amxsl	t1_dhg5xlz	1494553755	I like the app. I dont do anything with colors to justify buying it. But it would be cool to play around with.   Maybe an ad supported version? Show an ad every 5 clicks or pay $1.99 to get ad free?	phr0ze	t3_6amxsl
t3_6anxdi	t1_dhg618q	1494553892	Well played, Samsung.  I have no doubt that the iPhone 8's battery life will be substantially better.  We'll never get a perfectly fair test between Samsung and Apple, because they release phones about half a year differently than the other.	Lefthandedsock	t3_6anxdi
t3_6anxdi	t1_dhg658t	1494554041	Welcome to every year since the iPhone came out. Shouldn't Apple be out of the phone business by now since everyone's switched to Samsung based on your logic?	HugeIRL	t1_dhg105g
t3_6amxsl	t1_dhg6cwv	1494554329	It is a big problem. iPhone cameras do a lot of processing on the image before it comes to me with the raw data, which makes it impossible to extract true colors.   However, to calculate closest Pantones, I first convert the captured color to LAB color space and then find the closest Pantone colors. This makes sure the returned Pantone colors look similar not in terms of the RGB/CMYK values but in terms of human visual perception.   As far as I know, I can't reach for any higher accuracy than this. But I am still learning more in depth about color spaces and will keep updating my algo as I figure out how to make it more accurate.	kushsolitary	t1_dhg30a1
t3_6agx5v	t1_dhg6jnt	1494554583	Very good deal. It should work as the same as a regular high-end MP3 player. Which is what I am aiming to get.	naeads	t1_dhfig78

t3_6amxsl	t1_dhg7lbt	1494555956	That's totally cool! I wouldn't recommend buying the app either if you don't find it useful.   The reason I didn't do a free app with ads is because I personally don't like those apps and I believe it makes the user experience worse.

t3_6aotck	t1_dhg9a36	1494558372	It started again just now. Seems to be coming from both the bottom speakers and the top speaker. This time it beeped maybe 10 times and stopped.	Dirk-Killington	t3_6aotck
t3_6amxsl	t1_dhg9hsq	1494558695	You obviously wouldn't really use it day-to-day, but it's really useful when you're not sure what colour a t-shirt is for example, and there's no tag or employees nearby.	dontbesuchajerry	t1_dhg8kpn

t3_6anxdi	t1_dhgd3tu	1494564823	This all looks pretty good as of right now. However, I have very little faith in the longevity of the Samsung batteries. My S6 hemorrhage battery life by about 10% every half hour, with no apps running. It was actually a big reason why I switched back after not having an iPhone since the 4.  If this holds up, than I'm stoked that Samsung finally wrapped their heads around battery life, but I think I've owned my last Samsung device.	HappyNazgul	t3_6anxdi
t3_6amxsl	t1_dhgd7f3	1494565017	I haven't tested it against a device like Pantone Capsure, but if anyone has a similar device and would like to contribute the data then I'd love to share a promo code for the app with them.	kushsolitary	t1_dhgacfs

t3_6anxdi	t1_dhgh55x	1494574169	While physically the batteries would degrade, but I suspect the reason for your 10% drain per half hour has something to do with the kernal of the system.  I got the S2 and S4, and when I flashed both of them with cyanogen rom with new kernal, the battery life out performed when they were both brand new. So, if you want to breathe new life onto your S6 and not waste a perfectly good hardware, I suggest you flash a different kernal onto it and pass it onto your family member.	naeads	t1_dhgd3tu

t3_6anxdi	t1_dhglbhd	1494586197	Aside from Samsung's optimizations to the software etc they also have the benefit of using an soc on a smaller more efficient node process. Once we have access to the same node in the A11 soc then it will be a fair comparison and then we'll see what's what.

t3_6amxsl	t1_dhglsk5	1494587352	/u/kushsolitary I just bought your app and it is pretty great at identifying colors in real time! I have used the app "color screen" in a similar fashion when trying to match colors but yours uses the camera and that is brilliant. I have a suggestion for a feature... If you capture a color make some options to export it: Save it to camera roll as an image (you could use it as a lockscreen image for instance), send pantone info and a small color sample to a friend via text (that could be helpful when picking out interior paint colors, etc.), or even add it to a color pallette within the app. People who do design work would benefit from seeing colors grouped together for various projects.   But overall I'm glad I tried this one. Thanks for sharing!	ro50	t3_6amxsl

t3_6agx5v	t1_dhgnt2k	1494591510	False. Apple doesn't make mid-range devices. The 5c was an attempt to do so. They basically took the 5 and slapped a plastic back on it. It was a stupid idea and they probably won't do it again.  My demands for the SE won't be realized not because it's meant to be a mid-ranger, but there are technical reasons why not. They've been explained to me before. But a guy can dream!	dragontology	t1_dhf6vzg

t3_6anxdi	t1_dhgonaz	1494592935	Yes, we know that Samsung's screen is more energy efficient. Now use devices as a normal person and don't forget to charge Samsung in the evening if you want to hear an alarm in the morning.   PS: I've seen the last test, but 14h of a normal use is just not true. He shows that video playback sustains for 14h32min and then shows that real world use is 14.2h. The only "real world" I can imagine is a non-stop audio/video stream with low signal 3G.	smartello	t3_6anxdi

t3_6agx5v	t1_dhgsksd	1494598374	Uh, the 6 and soon to be 7 series are their Flagship lines.  They are faster than the SE.  They have better screens, they have more features.  So either the SE is a Midrange or Low-end series.  The 5C was a low end series.  I had a 5S and my wife got a 5C.  Night and day difference. My neighbor had a 5. Still that was better than the 5C.  At the time, the 5S was the high end phone, the 5C a midrange (relative to industry).	stromm	t1_dhgnt2k
t3_6amxsl	t1_dhgson1	1494598502	I bought this awhile ago. I had a ton of fun at a party telling people what color their skin was. As most have pretty funny names.	SlightlySlizzed	t3_6amxsl
t3_6amxsl	t1_dhgsua4	1494598693	People will spend $4 on a coffee but buying a $2 app that is made from code and took a person months to years to create is absurd to some folks. This isn't directed at you since you wouldn't find it useful, but free apps are what started this mindset.	SlightlySlizzed	t1_dhg5xlz

t3_6anxdi	t1_dhgu8ga	1494600347	The tests weren't really totally fair.  The S8 has a taller screen and his video and gaming tests weren't using the full display. This will drop the power draw of the screen extending battery life. Not saying that would allow the 7 Plus to outlast it mind you.  As the taller screen is pretty much the S8's biggest feature, it should have been fully utilized for the tests.	x3n0n1c	t3_6anxdi
t3_6amxsl	t1_dhgulns	1494600772	Wow, this really blew up! I wasn't expecting such an amazing response for my first app. Thank you for your amazing feedback and purchasing my little app. You guys really made my day! :)  So instead of answering your questions individually, I'll try to answer all of them here (makes it easy to discover).      **Would it be possible to add "x" feature to the app?**   Here's the [roadmap](http://kush.im/c23mt). If you couldn't find the feature you want in that list, please PM me and I'll definitely include that on the roadmap.  **How accurate are the colors captured?**   Not as accurate as a $500 physical device made specifically for that purpose. You'll be capturing the colors which you see on your phone screen, which may or may not be different from the real world, based on the lighting conditions and camera calibration.   However, most of the time during my testing, the camera calibrated just fine after a few seconds and I was able to pick colors accurately.  **Is there a way to manually adjust white balance?**   I am currently not sure if it's technically possible to do this but I've added this on my roadmap and will be looking into it very soon. If it's possible to do, then I'll surely do it.  **How accurate are the pantone colors to the captured colors?**   Very accurate. To calculate closest Pantones, I first convert the captured color to L.A.B. color space and then find the closest Pantone colors. This makes sure the returned Pantone colors look similar not in terms of the RGB/CMYK values but in terms of human visual perception.  **How did you manage to make this app despite being colorblind?**   Technically, it doesn't make much difference. I just had to trust the camera data and translate that to color names. Once I was done with that, I showed it to my friends with normal vision and they confirmed it was correct. After that it was mostly coding, haha!  Let me know if you guys have any other questions. I'll be happy to answer them. Also, I would love to know how you're using my app, and what all problems is it solving for you. It will help me optimise the app further according to your use cases.  Thank you!	kushsolitary	t3_6amxsl
t3_6anxdi	t1_dhgw6zm	1494602593	Battery degradation on my S7 Edge is one of the biggest reasons I made the switch to a 7+. I would leave it on my desk for an hour or two doing absolutely nothing and it would drain a quarter of the battery.	RapistNextDoor	t3_6anxdi
t3_6amxsl	t1_dhgxvpr	1494604484	Purchased your app, I work in large format digital printing . Will put the app to the test, could help a bit. If you could dial this app in to replace the i1 tools used to measure colour that could be huge.

t3_6akjr6	t1_dhgywaq	1494605623	Try asking /r/mobilerepair. They're professionals at this type of thing, the most an authorized repair center or the Apple store could do for you is swap the whole unit without the data.	PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES	t3_6akjr6
t3_6aseo3	t1_dhh07t5	1494607105	Is this a game pigeon issue or iMessage issue? Would updating to 10.3.1 fix it?	PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES	t3_6aseo3
t3_6amxsl	t1_dhh1dkq	1494608383	Yeah. I agree but free has its place. I definitely dont agree with those free to play games with false economies.   However I shouldn't go out and buy everything that costs less than a coffee. I do pay for apps I use especially if it has a professional use.   But I know what you mean, I see posts where someone knows they need an app badly and they are complaining because it costs $3.	phr0ze	t1_dhgsua4
t3_6anxdi	t1_dhh1dyl	1494608395	If true, that's pretty cool. I'm hoping that we start seeing a war for better battery life here in the immediate future. The 7 Plus has treated me really well so far, but I'll see where I am in a year.	HappyNazgul	t1_dhgdj7p

t3_6asbsa	t1_dhh49ik	1494611582	No Hiya doesn't ring your phone, it sends it to voicemail though. So I still get the voicemail notification. I don't want spammers/people to even have the option to leave a voicemail. Either direct them to a "The number is not in service message" (like Google Voice use to) or just reject the call and not send to voicemail.  "Block Contact" would require the spammer/person be in my contacts; Who wants to create a 100+ contacts just to block them. And I have no idea if that sends them to voicemail also, as I've never used it.	SlumnIt	t1_dhh3jgw
t3_6aseo3	t1_dhh4ine	1494611860	Yes it's stock iMessage. It's an iMessage app.	crisss1205	t1_dhh47n7
t3_6asbsa	t1_dhh591g	1494612688	Here's the trick I use to eliminate unwanted voicemails...  Record a 2-3 minute greeting.  The first 10-20 seconds is your 'hello, leave me a message', then I add, 'if you want to leave a voicemail press the star key', the rest is silence.  The scam voicemails are &lt; the 3 minutes of your 'greeting'.  Friends can still leave a voicemail by pressing star.  Even better change your greeting to say leave me a text or press the star key if you insist on leaving a voicemail, then 3 minutes of silence.  I think the problem you're running into is there's no way on the phone to reject a call without it going to voicemail.  I seem to recall that Hiya has partnered with some cell phone service providers to block calls at the carrier level.  This might be a better option for you.	jocamero	t1_dhh49ik

t3_6aga9l	t1_dhhbpyt	1494620031	We found the culprit. There were five audio files sitting in iTunes that said "Unknown Name, Unknown Artist". Deleting them after plugging the phone into iTunes seems to have solved the problem!	viaminorviator	t1_dhfto2l
t3_6aseo3	t1_dhhc5if	1494620543	I have the same problem and on the latest iOS update ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I guess it has to do with the app and not with iOS.	alex192000	t1_dhh1ur1
t3_6asbsa	t1_dhhcd97	1494620795	The only way to truly block calls is if your cellular carrier offers this feature.    In the US, T-Mobile and at&amp;t support call blocking at the network level.	crazyk4952	t3_6asbsa

t3_6agx5v	t1_dhhgy1w	1494626479	Wrong again. The 6 is not faster than the SE. The SE has the Apple A9 SoC, same as the 6s, which is also not faster. Of course the 7 is faster, it's newer.  As for the 5C, of course the 5s is going to be faster, but the 5 shouldn't be faster than a 5C. They have the same internals.	dragontology	t1_dhgsksd
t3_6asbsa	t1_dhhjwnm	1494630598	What crazyk4952 is saying is that Apple does not currently provide app developers for iOS a way to do what you describe. As of iOS 10, developers are not provided a way by Apple to intercept a users phone call. This means we can not provide custom services such as looking up a phone number during a phone call or blocking/silencing unwanted calls.  Android on the other hand does provide developers access to write apps that provide services such as caller id and call blocking apps in real time.	BonerOfNostalgia	t1_dhhgne4

t3_6agx5v	t1_dhhoyap	1494638062	So you have compared them in hand yourself?  I have.  For work, 5S to 6, 6/s to SE.  5 to 5c in a personal setting.  Regardless what the hardware is, the 6 is barely faster than the SE.  The 6S is almost exactly the same.  But those phones have larger screens and more options.  And were/are the flagship model.  I picked the SE for size though, not performance.	stromm	t1_dhhgy1w
t3_6aseo3	t1_dhhpj6n	1494638917	It's definitely an iOS bug, but one that hasn't been fixed in 10.3.1. I develop apps and the system for iMessage apps is buggy as hell.	mistermagicman	t1_dhhfc26

t3_6agx5v	t1_dhht6wa	1494644647	The SE and 6s use the same Apple A9 chipset, so they would have similar performance. I've covered this.  Why you think the 6 is faster than the 6s makes about as much sense as the rest of what you've said. I don't know what you're trying for, but it's not working. Maybe you can convince someone who knows less about phones than you do, but you happen to have found someone who knows more, and thus, most of your words make no sense. You might as well be trying to tell a car guy the gas goes in the radiator. Without trying to be insulting or condescending, it simply does not compute.	dragontology	t1_dhhoyap

t3_6asbsa	t1_dhhtx0j	1494645861	This simply isn't true.  Look up CallKit.  Hiya implements CallKit and blocks calls.    Perhaps what's up for debate is what a blocked call is.  OP's opinion is it won't allow the person to leave a voicemail.  Others might think it simply doesn't ring their phone; effectively sending the call to voicemail.  &gt; As of iOS 10, developers are not provided a way by Apple to intercept a users phone call.

t3_6awlbu	t1_dhi0imd	1494660820	Ah I see. Let's see, I've had my phone since launch and I came from an iPhone 6.  The battery life is pretty amazing I have gone through entire workdays without charging and still have close to 20% left when I head home. This wouldn't have been possible with my 6.  Honestly though, the camera is the kicker here. With the camera, all the shots I take as an amateur looks good enough to go up on social media as is without much adjustments. The dual camera really shines when in Portrait mode and also offers 12x zoom (nobody really uses this though).  This is the best iPhone you can buy on the market right now.   If you are open to integrating into the iOS ecosystem. If you are ok without the earphone jack (it didn't really bother me). If you don't want to customise everything like you did back on android.  This is a solid phone I really love it.	youshouldbeglad	t1_dhi0de1

t3_6avnxf	t1_dhi1ncz	1494664510	Five. Both index, both thumbs, right thumb twice - second time at weird angles. Not sure if there's really any substantial benefit in putting the same one in twice, but I never get any misreads and there's no lag on my 6s so why not.   *Edit - I just checked and in five tries using it at oddball angles, my "right thumb" entry definitely is the one that is being recognized.	chzplz	t3_6avnxf

t3_6awlbu	t1_dhi4esd	1494673927	The speakers and charging port are coated and insulated internally to prevent water damage. They are still the phone's weak points for water damage, so water hitting them with enough pressure (a shower, garden hose or just having the phone at &gt;1 meter underwater) could still cause damage.  But in general, they're water resistant like the rest of the phone and should be fine. The speakers do tend to sound very quiet and unpleasant when they've been exposed to water, so it's best not to use them for a while until they dry.	DatDeLorean	t1_dhi0nvc
t3_6avnxf	t1_dhi4giy	1494674070	This got me thinking... Apple should improve Touch ID and make it so that we can wake the iPhone using the same unlock finger. Similar to how those who have their "raise to wake" function enabled *unlock* their phone by simply resting their finger on the home button, those who have it disabled should be able to just *wake* the phone by doing the same.	budzwhiz	t1_dhi2ic7

t3_6avnxf	t1_dhid004	1494690528	I have one for my thumb and one for my index finger on each hand, so 4 total. I never even considered that it might slow it down. I don't feel like it does.   I guess technically it might take more time to compare against each stored fingerprint, but not that I can perceive. I can't press the home button when the phone is locked without unlocking it, unless I do it unnaturally fast on purpose.	HomemadeBananas	t3_6avnxf

t3_6avnxf	t1_dhifu4r	1494694687	Number of fingers registered *does not* affect the speed of recognition nor entry.  The iOS operating system is evaluating and obtaining the "key" from the fingerprint currently in contact with the TouchID sensor when you attempt to log in.  Once this key is known it simply compares to the set of stored "keys," not stored _fingerprints_.  Neither iOS nor TouchID compares fingerprints directly (due to the use of keys) so there is no resource intensive "print matching" against a large set of prints at the time of login.  This keeps things feeling speedy, regardless if there are 10 or 1000 registered fingerprints.  Source: I'm an iOS developer.	GetsHighDoesMath	t3_6avnxf

t3_6azwnm	t1_dhiqaeg	1494709678	I personally think current flagship phones are way too expensive. My high end laptop is cheaper than my iPhone 7. My 50" smart 3d tv with my home theater sound system is cheaper. Carrying little device on me at all times that's €1,000+ feels ridiculous. I remember first  iPhone, got it for free on 12 months contract. Same for 3GS - free on 12 months. And these phones were 10x better at the time than current iPhone 7 today. Which BTW I got for €399 on 24 months contract. If next iPhone is even more expensive I won't be able to justify that expense, fuck it.	majnus	t3_6azwnm
t3_6azwnm	t1_dhir1ua	1494710795	Don't worry, you can just buy an iPhone 7s! Of course it will look and feel very similar to the 7...and the 6s...and the 6.... /s  And of course right now it's just a rumor. If the 8 is priced similar to the S8 ($720 USD) I think it's a fair price all things considered. But $1k!? Lol, nope. I'll just buy a OnePlus 5 or Pixel 2. Actually I already plan to do that. But that price would justify the switch even more	verysketchyreply	t3_6azwnm
t3_6aypei	t1_dhisatp	1494712642	This is my very first post on reedit. YAY! Read the rules and expect i am submitting post in the correct sub.  Thank you kindly, in advance, for any support that you may be able too offer!!!!  I was under the impression that i could post and image with text though it seemed not to work, better lucky next time for me, apologies.  **Story:** Purchased an iPhone 4s second hand in 2013.  Few months back (around the time I created this first &amp; only account on reedit) I was driving with my partner, in morning peak hour congested Bangkok, Thailand traffic.  Phone was resting on my lap charging from a power bank purchased from an Bangkok "iStudio" premier Apple reseller.  Traveling at around 25km's per/hr I suddenly hear a fizz noise and immediately thereafter the phone overheats and precedes to smoke, smothering the inside of a small 4-door hatchback within seconds.  As soon as I realise whats going on, I slam on the brakes coming to a complete stop.  I pick up phone from my lap and toss it to my partner, she grabs it and tosses back to me and it falls onto the drivers floor.  By this time the car is engulfed with light white smoke, partner exits car from the passenger side door, I was trying to open the drivers door to get out.  However, weirdly I could not open my drivers door, and hastily preceded to exit the car via the opened front passenger door.  Subsequently, I ran around the car, opening the drivers side door and a big puff of smoke exited.  I considered, but refused to pick up the phone with my hands and toss it out of the car as it was still smoldering excessively.  I found some newspaper, picked the phone up, and placed it on the asphalt road.  Traffic slowed all around me, cars halted behind, and me staring down at the iPhone is disbelief thinking when did i last back up my phone data in iTunes.   Within 2 minutes flat a traffic police officer arrived at the scene on a scooter, wondering why i had stopped and explained what occurred, though did not understand initially, only until i showed him the partially smoking exploded phone.  Police Officer relaxed, got on his uhf radio, and told his colleagues some "Falang" (Thai word meaning white devil) phone exploded.   Several minutes later the phone stopped smoldering and cooled down,  then was able to wrap it up and be on my way.  **Assistance Required:**  *The reason for posting this thread is that i am wondering if i have any recourse on the manufacturer Apple, even* *though the phone is clearly out of warranty.  If so, how would i go about claiming compensation from directly* *Apple?*  *Is there anyway of being able to recover my data, eg photos and contact list in the damaged state the phone is *in, as shown, in the picture attached?*  *Is there anything else i may need to consider?*  **Thanks once again in advance.

t3_6azwnm	t1_dhit9uj	1494714033	While I don't disagree that nothing is free. At the time the market for non contact plans wasn't as big as it is now and the pricing structure was different.   The per month cost for a plan in contact was the same as the monthly cost once the contract expired.  I'd regularly get a new iPhone with contact. Next year find myself eligible for early upgrade. Get the next iPhone again and sell my old one for more than the $99 I paid for it for upgraded storage.   Then next and the plans like that came out and the game changed.	Aytewun	t1_dhislov

t3_6aypei	t1_dhizof2	1494723782	Sounds like the battery was the cause, but not 100%. I didn't see any power banks at my local iStudio, maybe it depends on the stores.  If you were using all OEM parts (Even the battery), then you can contact AppleCare and they'll get you to the safety line and ask a questions and such to see what they can do. If it was 3rd party or non authorized parts, you might be out of luck.	xFury86	t1_dhisatp

It's not even worth it on contract. It's already $500 to get on contract. If they raise the price even more it will soon cost you as much on contract as it used to cost for the phone outright.

t3_6awlbu	t1_dhj6eqh	1494734708	I am in the minority, but I'm switching back to my 6s. I'm on T-Mobile and on my 7 and 7 plus, have had constant connectivity issues. Both phones say no signal multiple times per hour, won't hold a wifi connection and reception is god awful. I did like the quality of the plus and the camera is great, but I can't get signal for longer than 20 minutes, so...	lauradiamandis	t3_6awlbu
t3_6azwnm	t1_dhj6j8u	1494734939	iPhones are definitely a premium product. The price is understandable for the US market but it's because of the USD/CAD exchange rate that makes it outrageous for Canadians.   Personally, I'm in the apple eco-system so it wouldn't make sense to leave even if it costs a premium. But there are options like the SE or going over to Android with low cost manufacturers like One Plus and Xiaomi.	murtadi007	t3_6azwnm

t3_6awlbu	t1_dhj85i0	1494737997	I was nervous about choosing between the two as well and I just got the bigger one in case I wanted to return it if I couldn't get used to it. I've gotten used to the size though, and holding my girlfriend's 7 feels way smaller now. The screen size is great for watching netflix, the speakers sound good to my untrained ear, and my battery lasts almost all day, but I tend to watch a ton of videos or read comics on my phone. Over all I don't think it's a bad purchase if you have larger hands. If it feels uncomfortable in your hands it might not be the best idea, texting one handed is doable, but sometimes a hassle.

I have also found I do not mind the supplied apple lightening plug headphones as well. YMMV, but I'm satisfied either way.   As a (former) die hard Android user fed up with the fragmented update/patch cycles (Google to Samsung to Carrier to end-user 6-8 months later), I just moved from a Note to a 7+ too and I could not be any happier.

Please don't take offense in that as I don't think they are calling you a white devil. Farang is generally used to refer to white foreigners and has no bad intent. It's just there's no easier word for it in Thai so we kept using this slang. The official word for it is longer (chao tang chard) and nobody bothers to use it in daily life.

t3_6b2ir0	t1_dhjd1h8	1494750616	Just: **why?** If you want a smaller screen then go for the 7 + Apple Battery Case. The SE is great but just for people that are looking for an upgrade or a totally new iOS device. It's litterally an improved 5S. iOS 11 will eventually enhance all the 3D touch features (that you miss with the SE) and offer better support for bigger screens. You'll also lose optical stabilization, faster Touch-ID and a decent front facing camera. The SE one is just ugh with no optimal light conditions.	Bishibazu	t3_6b2ir0

I did miss 3D Touch and some apps are totally built for 4.7/5.5 and not optimized for the smaller screen. I'll probably move to the new OLED phone next, whatever it will be named.

t3_6azwnm	t1_dhjjp5m	1494769230	I like buying the biggest size the sell for the HDD and in the special edition so I'm assuming that one might be like $1300 then you don't even have your case in that price or your other accessories, I think the best deals though are deals on Apple products found on sites like Ebay. I have a 6s and I'm not upgrading until it like takes amazingly better photos or the battery lasts way longer. I mean I might upgrade once the 8s comes out to the 8 if it has a sick rounded display and like higher than 720p on the 8s.   The trick is if you wait for the 8s or 8s+ that 1000 (or maybe even 1200-1400 for the larger sizes) phone used 8 will go down to like 400 bucks or like less than half and you'll get the fully loaded version with maybe a few scratches and without the box, I'll take that and save 600. I don't have a contract though so I have to pay full value on the new phones.  I got my iPhone 6s 128gb recently and I paid $360 thus proving my $400 theory but I think it will more likely be around 500 if it's more starting out.	wizardomg	t3_6azwnm

t3_6b2ir0	t1_dhjlg15	1494772253	I went from an iPhone 7+ to an iphone SE. I mostly use my phone for whatsapp, youtubing and clash royale. Honestly the only thing I can do on this phone now is whatsapp. Consuming media on this is a pain. My honest advice would be if you dont use your phone for media or gaming buy an SE but if you do stick to the 7+ and wait for the iphone 8. It is rumoured to have a bezel less display.   Also if you want to ask any specific questions go ahead.	Gr33d007	t3_6b2ir0
t3_6b2ir0	t1_dhjmcps	1494773652	If you don't use your phone anymore, the SE is definitely the way to go.  It's super handy to slip into your pocket and I like that I can sit down without taking it out.  That being said, you can definitely feel the strain in your eyes after like 20 minutes of looking at your screen.	Slyman180	t3_6b2ir0
t3_6b2ir0	t1_dhjn7dt	1494774942	I went from a 7+ to an SE, used it for roughly 3 months then switched back to my 7+. The only pros IMO of the SE are the decreased size in pocket and it doesn't feel awkward when holding it to your head. Otherwise I prefer the 7+ for everything else.	damstr	t3_6b2ir0

t3_6b2ir0	t1_dhjt1wn	1494783143	I went from a 7 to an SE. Bought both used and ended up selling the 7 for the same price I bought it after six months of use. Overall I decided that the 7 wasn't 400 dollars better than the se as they're especially the same phone in most of the ways that matter. 400 dollars is the difference in price between what I sold the 7 for and bought a 64gb se for.   The biggest irl difference I've felt is two hand typing. It's a cramped keyboard for sure. Swipe typing on Google keyboard is fine.   Ultimately it's a personal choice. Now after several months with the se in considering getting a regular 7 again as I've seen the prices dip. Seems like there's a good market of used devices now as people prepare to sell their for the new iPhone coming.   Why go back to the 7 if I'm fine with the se? Boredom and because I can 🙂. So you do you as well. If I was op and I could find an se on the cheap give it a shot	lotuskid34	t3_6b2ir0

When iPhone looses all power to the motherboard (removing battery, since it does not have backup baterry like PC MoBos have) it resets the time to 1970ish and therefore it can not find any service and makes you to "wait" until the time you last locked your phone.

t3_6b56oz	t1_dhk5b3x	1494798790	Oh. It's kind of arbitrary. Basically, every computer stored time as a 32-bit integer. The current time is that integer plus January 1 1970. January 1 1970 is "Unix Time," and they set the standard back when they _were_ the standard. There's no reason for every OS to use a different time when everyone is used to this one, and it worked just fine. There also isn't a specific reason that Unix used this time, other than it was like 1972 when they did.  There's actually a problem when they won't be able to calculate against that anymore in 2038.

t3_6b5oid	t1_dhkoiq0	1494828728	For an *signed* 64-bit int yes you're right.  But for unsigned you have the entire 64 bits to represent the int. You don't need to sacrifice the last 64^th bit as the sign bit.  So for 64-bit unsigned int you can have from 0 -&gt; 2^64 - 1. This max 64-bit unsigned value in decimal is 18446744073709551615. The min is 0. [This StackOverflow post clarifies the max of signed 64-bit int](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6003492/how-big-can-a-64bit-signed-integer-be)	ekeen1	t1_dhkoaru
t3_6b5oid	t1_dhkoq3g	1494829215	You're right about the uses for 2's complement. It solves the multiple 0 representation problem and is better for binary arithmetic!   But the key thing is that 2's complement still uses the sign bit. In fact, you can test it with a positive value, say 5.   5 in binary would be 0101.  To convert to a signed value, we perform 2's complement.  Invert the bits, add 1.  1010 + 1.  -5 = -8 + 2 + 1. (Note that the -8 is where the sign bit comes into play).  We now have the negative representation for positive 5 in binary (1011)!  For the OP's post, his iPhone is 64-bit. This means that the max decimal value of an *unsigned* int would be 2^64 - 1. What if it was signed? Then like the example above, the most significant bit would need to be used to represent negative numbers. You would then only have 2^63 - 1 as the biggest decimal value.  Sorry for the wall of text, I've noticed several people making the mistake of unsigned versus signed and wanted to clarify.	ekeen1	t1_dhkocgf
t3_6b5oid	t1_dhkp1w9	1494830013	99% of the time if you see a large, weirdly specific number, it's probably near one of the important powers of two (2^4 = 16, 2^8 = 256, 2^16 = 65,535 (which you would see a lot in "number of colors" for displays in the mid 90's, on 16-bit systems), 2^32 = 16 million-ish (number of colors for more modern 32-bit machines, or for 32-bit code running on 64-bit machines, so still very common), and this number, 2^64 = 9 quintillion-ish.  Once you know that this is a pretty common bug in programming (something any first-year CS student knows), then you don't even have to learn those numbers - when you see a big one, just google the powers of two and find it.

t3_6b9tkm	t1_dhl1ulj	1494858822	Only time Siri activates for me is when I'm watching YouTube videos...	FrederikTwn	t3_6b9tkm
t3_6b9tkm	t1_dhl26ky	1494859253	I use to have that problem and then I realized I can press and hold the home button while I'm talking. After I'm done I release the button and Siri processes what I said.	3seven1	t3_6b9tkm
t3_6b4k8w	t1_dhl2wt5	1494860154	Report them! The process is super easy and they make it very simple to narrow down exactly which directions were bad.	Sandurz	t1_dhkkxnl

t3_6b9tkm	t1_dhl8jp3	1494866756	Mine did it last week. I had never heard of the issue until someone posted here and then, *BAM*, mine started doing it. I restarted the phone and it cleared right up for me.	TotesSafeWorkAccount	t3_6b9tkm
t3_6b9tkm	t1_dhl8l08	1494866798	It happened to me a couple of days ago. I restarted my phone and that fixed the issue.	8-o-8	t3_6b9tkm

t3_6b9tkm	t1_dhld0hf	1494871787	Well, normally that's how it's supposed to work, but that's not the problem. The issue is that Siri flat out stops listening almost immediately, even if you're holding the home button down the whole time.  I hold down the button, and keep holding it down, but before I can even get a word in, Siri say, "Sorry, I didn't catch that." Try it again, same thing.  It's got to be something server-side that's affecting a small number of users.	cocobandicoot	t1_dhl26ky
t3_6b4k8w	t1_dhldf3b	1494872240	You can actually book tables in the Maps app as well. If you search for a restaurant, the Book Table option is right beside the Directions button. It's quite handy	N-Code	t3_6b4k8w
t3_6b9tkm	t1_dhldqho	1494872595	I posted about this just this morning. I came about this issue right after updating to 10.3. No luck yet.	jonathon8903	t3_6b9tkm
t3_6b9tkm	t1_dhlk8nf	1494879963	I had the problem for two or three days last week and right when I connected the phone to my laptop to attempt a back up and wipe, I backed it up and decided let me try One more time and she worked all of a sudden and has been ever since.   Either she saw her life flash before her eyes and decided to play nice finally as I prepared to wipe the phone, or maybe syncing with iTunes had something to do with it? Or maybe it was a lucky coincidence.	Nickachu92	t3_6b9tkm
t3_6b2ir0	t1_dhlxiy5	1494896813	Same. It wasn't for me either. I went to the 6s again but the SE is a really good phone.	lauradiamandis	t1_dhjh1uv
t3_6b5oid	t1_dhm7f9z	1494910596	Yeah that makes a lot more sense now, thanks for that.	Unclbobagil	t1_dhkoiq0
t3_6b9tkm	t1_dhmbjks	1494919808	I have this problem. Doesn't matter how I activate Siri, via Hey Siri or holding down the Home Button, it will immediately "close" and say "sorry I didn't get that" or whatever. I've tried resetting Siri, rebooting my phone (sleep and home, hold) and restored my phone. It just keeps closing after activation.	kevinythepanini	t3_6b9tkm

t3_6b9tkm	t1_dhmhock	1494936229	I've stopped using Siri altogether. What about you?	kevinythepanini	t1_dhmhnnm
t3_6b9tkm	t1_dhmiqgz	1494938036	I use it a lot less. If I keep tapping the microphone usually on the 5th or 6th try it will work.	moby323	t1_dhmhock
t3_6amxsl	t1_dhn4he9	1494962831	Jeez, you own an iPhone 7 Plus 256GB (most expensive model), and don't want to spend $2?	Chandler_is_a_girl	t1_dhg01y6
t3_6b9tkm	t1_dhplico	1495086486	Okay so yesterday I tried Siri on my MacBook and she had the same issue, but I tried Siri on my iPhone again today and she's back to normal. May have been the 10.3.2 update or my use of Siri on the mac	Sky_roller	t3_6b9tkm
t3_6b9tkm	t1_dhpurgq	1495109886	Mine is back to normal now too. I think it must have been a server side issue.	moby323	t1_dhplico
t3_6aotck	t1_dhqpn3z	1495144523	I'm having the same thing happen, just started within the last hour.   My ringer is off also so it should only vibrate	Unique_Coyote	t3_6aotck
t3_6alrol	t1_dhs2llk	1495220640	I really love Wunderlist but Microsoft is closing it, so I've been doing research on to-do apps.  I created this video that shows the pros and cons of the 6 best task apps https://youtu.be/xrWDhm2MNE4	guym	t3_6alrol
t3_6aotck	t1_dhtuvgz	1495327343	Mine JUST did it too and Idk wtf going on.	karmakamille	t3_6aotck
t3_6aotck	t1_dhwfi58	1495484081	Just had mine do it. Took me a minute to figure out that it was coming from my phone!	MsMagoo6862	t3_6aotck
t3_6aotck	t1_dhwxg9h	1495506498	So this happened to me at dinner tonight. I literally thought the restaurant was having issues. It lasted for like an hour and a half. No apps opened, no music , NOT an amber alert. Just like a smoke detector but not as loud. Any answers ?!	freckles-and-fur	t3_6aotck
t3_6aotck	t1_dhxl8gu	1495551790	Update: I lost my iPhone 7 in a river last week.. still nursing that wound. Brand new, no insurance. Fuck me right?  So I'm back on my spare SE right now. Whatdayaknow, same high pitched beep happening again.   Still nothing about it online.	Dirk-Killington	t3_6aotck
t3_67jf3i	t1_di3oznu	1495862856	It's a really good case and thin as fuck! I recommend them to everybody, they are slippery though and offer no protection but protection is for fools with butter fingers or drunks.	mygrammarrox	t3_67jf3i
t3_6aotck	t1_diadhc8	1496263013	Just had this issue. iPhone 6. On LTE at the time, reading Facebook. Does anybody know what it is?  Like others said, it sounded like a quiet fire alarm.	CallouslyThrownAway	t3_6aotck
t3_6aotck	t1_diadl0n	1496263127	It's a sound file that plays in the background. I have to close the phone then press home and pause the file for it to stop. I think it's some form of malware.	Dirk-Killington	t1_diadhc8
