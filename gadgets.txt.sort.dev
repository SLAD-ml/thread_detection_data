t3_5z3ofh	t1_dev52fz	1489400835	The answer to that would be the Asus Flip, (I have one). Convertible, as in the hinge allows the screen to fully fold flat and it has a touch screen. It also has Google play store support so you can run Android apps. All in all a very nice experience, full keyboard for when you need it a nice trackpad for precise mouse movement and a touch screen for when that is appropriate. As for relaxed useage, I sometimes find that a tablet can get quite heavy. So a laptop for factor that can be put in tent mode for watching movies can be the best solution.  Tablets are all good and well but I have not seen much innovation in the market for some time. Uber expensive ones that are thin and delicate. Or a race to the bottom with under powered devices with a poor user experience.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCx3uway4Pc	Tollowarn	t1_dev4prw

I think it is fair to have a $40 price increase from the 3 to the 3T, don't you?  I think that if OnePlus does things properly, they will be like the Tesla Motors of the mobile industry. Creating comparably affordable, yet superior, products. If they follow in Tesla Motors' footsteps, they will be able to make their products more and more affordable, as production scales (wishful thinking, I know, but this is how I hope things go down).

Are there any motion detection cams with good battery life that I can set up in my garage that will alert my smartphone?   My garage is within WiFi connection distance.

t3_5zaqam	t1_dexvmph	1489540541	They are usually interchangeable. It's just preference in my experience. I use Windows pretty much every day I come home, and it pisses me off once a week so I definitely wouldn't use it work. But it can be the opposite for some people.  Not saying work isn't possible on a PC it just isn't for me. I do a lot of graphic design and it's usually Mac's for the other folks in my industry.  I'd say mostly because Adobe products run like ass on Windows. But that goes back to Mac's not needing beefy specs. As you mentioned in the your previous comment it's a lot easier to optimize, not just for Apple but other developers as well. Same reason an iPhone is so easy to develop for. Closed hardware has its uses.  I just hate Windows, I wish SteamOS would've taken off.	Renegade8995	t1_dexmdn4

I would stay away from any Windows tablet on an Atom processor as they're just too slow.

t3_5z3ofh	t1_dey9e4l	1489563152	The charge 3 is a bit louder, but also slightly bigger.  That loudness also includes more bass (which I dislike). Personally, I prefer the UE Boom for slightly smaller footprint and sounds more clear. But I guess the sound preference could come down to what type of music you listen to. If you like hip hop or dance music, maybe you want more bass? Or maybe you want rock guitar solos to sound a bit more clear on the UE Boom 2?	evilr2	t1_dev4w0z

To me, the xmos is gonna give you all the quality you could ever want and deployment will be faster than trying to program all that DSP with the fpga.

t3_609nwj	t1_df5197y	1489950534	Yep, predictive maintenance for MRI. We attempted to take data points generated by the devices on board sensors to detect patterns that would indicate upcoming failures.  Not a rules based operation and alert but true predictive modeling. Because of the 'sneaker-net' component of having to manually pull device data logs, we could not automate the process and there for couldn't truly sell the value of having analytics run on the device.   Our work around was to use external sensors such as accelerometers to measure vibration and excessive vibration which is sort of the universal indicator of something breaking. It was too limited of a solution and the value was not great enough to justify the investment.   Lots of work went into it. A year of my full time attention and a whole team of Ph.D. Engineers and data scientists. Plus side is that I got to play with raspberry Pi and all sort of IoT sensor gadgets! Yay!	Hi_Dee	t1_df50iny

The initiative to use pi is because it is small so you can put it inside the machine, and because it is computer so it can pull data from your device then do some analytics?  I saw a lot of activity in pi , but interested in how it is used to solve real life problem.	hiacbanks	t1_df5197y

t3_609nwj	t1_df55dyy	1489955721	No, not a manual box to be physically pulled. It was a DOS version user interface outside of the MRI device in a control room. The device controls had to be in a separate room because an MRI is essentially one big ass super magnet. Can't have anything metal in the same room when it is running. To access the MRI sensor logs you have to sit down at the workstation in the control room and pull up the device menu in service mode, drill down and run a report. The report in binary and needed data mapping. Basically it was very labor intensive and could not be automated.   MRI for medical purposes are subject to lots and lots of regulations. One big no-no is changing the original design in any way, that being a OEM and hospital rule. It was permitable to  install external sensors and hardware such as the raspberry Pi to collect data to use in our predictive maintenance applications, but after much fooling around with lots of different hardware we found it to be a wash in the use case we were exploring.

All the attempts in developing an IoT use case of great value to ANY market has open the door to security threats of whole new caliber on many levels.   Any one in "IoT" knows that security is gaining foothold in IoT faster than any other. Reason being all our non-security attempts to create an applicable use case in any form has put an abundance of accessible hardware and software in places they have never been put before, and as such, opened up a whole new world of opportunity for hackers.

t3_61s1gw	t1_dfh25uc	1490632792	I keep getting tempted to get one but I had a horrible allergic reaction to my Charge.

t3_61s1gw	t1_dfh5ukw	1490636730	Idk why you're being downvoted. All my other health info (weight, body fat %, lean muscle mass, sleep time, blood pressure, and labs) are all already in Apple Health, which allows me to have one spot that collects data from all my apps. Those apps can then pull data from it as needed. Data that can't be moved or shared is much less useful. Being locked to Fitbit's platform is a big reason why I haven't bought one yet.	dolphinsarethebest	t1_dfh0mbd
t3_61s1gw	t1_dfh6bec	1490637225	Do you have any of the other Fitbits? I have a ChargeHR and honestly the vibration is so much that it actually wakes my partner when sleeping on opposite sides of the bed. If it's a lighter vibration, I might actually prefer it.	thelmick	t1_dfgtmaa
t3_61s1gw	t1_dfh80md	1490639026	I know you were being sarcastic, but i'll bite anyway. I have been looking into getting one because I have an office job and very little time to devote to exercise. I think having something like this will help remind me to do a little extra each day, and hopefully that in turn will make me think more carefully about my food and drink consumption. I'm turning 40 next month and it's high time I get back into a healthy routine before it's too late.	SpaceGoonie	t1_dfh5bbu
t3_61s1gw	t1_dfh8948	1490639274	I don't actually. I have an Apple Watch, but I was late to work because of the weak vibration. Not taking any more chances and sent it back. Other gripes is it's not waterproof so I have to take it off to shower. And the display screen doesn't stay on long enough when looking at your heart rate or other things. I had the original fit bit and really want to believe, but this device is not for me.	Gjproducer	t1_dfh6bec
t3_61s1gw	t1_dfh9dfr	1490640437	How do you like your Apple watch? I've looked at it a number of times, but the lack of sleep monitoring and battery have always been a weak points for me. I really want one, but just can't justify it for the price.	thelmick	t1_dfh8948
t3_61s1gw	t1_dfhddj9	1490644791	I have an Apple Watch too, charge it at work and use an app called Pillow to monitor my sleep at night, only complain is I have to tell it when I'm going to sleep instead of it knowing automatically. Battery is a bit annoying until you find a gap in your schedule to charge it everyday. Haptic feedback and everything else is really nice. I also dislike that there is no option to start a weight lifting gym workout, only cardio workouts	Muawiyaibnabusufyan	t1_dfh9dfr
t3_61s1gw	t1_dfhftxt	1490647594	Wow, are they still having that issue? I had a Force back in 2014 that gave me what the company claimed "irritant contact dermatitis". (I'm not allergic to anything as far as I know, and countless of watches/fitness bands have never caused me skin problems.) There was [a huge recall](https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1243), and I never got a fitbit again. It was more because of how the company ignored early complaints and completely downplayed the issue.	chinlaf	t1_dfh25uc
t3_61s1gw	t1_dfhgxiw	1490648915	One full WEEK before a charge, impressive.  I bought my Withings Go almost 9 months ago.  It is still on the original battery.  It’s not pretty, the display is boring B&amp;W, and it has no heart monitor but… the battery life is a non-issue, I can actually sleep without it irritating the hell out of me, and wear it in the shower without worry.	hmspain	t3_61s1gw
t3_61s1gw	t1_dfhrqze	1490662389	I had a really bad reaction that looked like a chemical burn. I'm allergic to both nickel and latex. They claim there's no latex in the band but there is a trace of nickel in the clasp however it's "surgical grade" material and thus is hypoallergenic. My dermatologist said mine was definitely a reaction to something. I had to be treated with prednisone to fully clear it up and I had some slight discoloration that lasted for about 10 weeks after I stopped wearing it.   Fitbit is still claiming there aren't allergy issues and that it's dermatitis. I loved the Charge, I liked the software, but I don't want to risk another reaction for that kind of money combined with how Fitbit handled the complaints as well as how they continue to handle them.	angrygnomes58	t1_dfhftxt

t3_61y5uh	t1_dfjkkqn	1490755492	&gt; if the batteries ever go bad, you need a new controller.   That's not true, you can often just replace the batteries. It's easier in some controllers than others, but it's usually not that hard to do. I know on the Wii U Pro Controller, there's only one screw in the way. Easy peasy.  Personally, I'm pretty done with replaceable batteries and I die a little bit inside every time my Xbox controller batteries die and I have to swap them. I much prefer the convenience of being able to quickly and easily charge things. It's just so much simpler to me, I don't have to dig around a drawer to find batteries all the time.	jooes	t1_dfigov9

t3_61y5uh	t1_dfksd7t	1490821956	I wouldn't call it a step backwards.  I know people love the option to swap when dead, but a lot of people who don't necessarily play marathons would love the option to just top it off without having to take out batteries and worry about a separate charger. It's not like you can't have both.  My g700 mouse is able to swap out a rechargeable battery when I want, yet also have it charge when plugged in.  And can be used on a dead battery on just usb.  It may add a little weight or cost but if you're paying that much for controllers, why not cater towards both sides to make everyone happy?	baicai18	t1_dfkezxo

It never failed to wake me, and it always did so gently - over the course of a minute or two.  My vivoactive HR, on the lowest setting, startles me out of sleep. They 'fade' it as well, but the initial starting point is way, way too high.  It never ceases to amaze me how half-baked Garmin products can be, beyond fit and finish...	alltheacro	t1_dfh6bec

t3_61y5uh	t1_dfm8fqn	1490900652	You can already have both. Microsoft already sells Charge and play kit made specifically for the xbox one controller which can be charged while in the controller just by plugging the controller with the 9 feet cable that comes with it (and the controller can be used while its being charged). I don't understand what you want more.	shmed	t1_dfksd7t
t3_61y5uh	t1_dfmbp20	1490904121	That's like an extra $20 and then basically converts it to lithium. You can't charge them outside (perhaps there are wall chargers) and you can't use your own batteries.    The method I was referring to with the g700 is that it can take any normal nimh rechargeable AA battery to use and charge at the same time. So you can swap to new batteries when you want, yet if you just want to plug it in to charge you can.  When your battery starts to not hold a charge as long, just get  new AA and replace it.  That's pretty much the best of both worlds, but you don't really see it much with controllers.  Personally I don't really care, I have extra batteries and a wall charger, and for the base model controllers I'm fine with them being cheaper and not including the extra costs to have a built in charging capabilities.  But I think some people looking at the more expensive controllers would like this feature. Yet a lot of people resist it thinking that they can only go swappable and no charge, or lithium and chargeable, yet the option for both have been in mice for years	baicai18	t1_dfm8fqn

Ehhhh  Currently have a Nexus 6P - and I'm not a small handed man by any means, and I still can't comfortably use it one handed flying around a few apps, etc etc.   Don't get me wrong, I'd love to use one as the tech in it looks great, but once the "new" wears off of any device, the massive size is a bit of a dealbreaker.   I have normal size "guy" pockets, and when the phone is taking up the entirety of them making it weird to sit down sometimes, I have to stop and think "damn, not exactly  cool"	MrNerd82	t3_629l4o

All of this stuff can be replicated on my S8, but it will never be as seamless as with my iPhone.   I've been super satisfied with my 4 years of iPhone use, but the iPhone 7 is just so uninspiring, I couldn't justify giving them my money for this iteration. I'm sure I'll be back though.

t3_609nwj	t1_dfsrfcm	1491271827	Disclaimer: I don't have any firsthand experience with any of this stuff, I've just been researching.  I've been toying with the idea of making my own no-internet, voice-activated home controller without having everything it hears sent-up to Amazon or Google.  So I started looking into various solutions. Most stuff out there seems to rely on PocketSphinx for speech recognition.  It looks like the killer feature of the Alexa isn't the voice-recognition - which has multiple competitors, and can be "run" on a Pi - but the far field mic array to pick up human voice from distance.  Respeaker is the only other option available that I'm aware of with a far-field microphone array (https://www.seeedstudio.com/s/respeaker.html). However, the mic array is only compatible with their custom, Arduino-compatible board.   I'm interested to see which one of these options will be better. Respeaker is pretty new, but seems to be geared more towards people who want to build 'apps' than setup an entire OS. It comes with PocketSphinx, but I'm not sure how difficult it would be to get Jasper running. I'm not sure some of the home automation tools like OpenHAB or CastleOS can run on this board directly either.  This Matrix solution would definitely be cheaper, and there are plenty of guides available for installing PocketSphinx, Jasper, OpenHAB, etc on a Pi. There might be a higher chance of adoption from the diy community since there's a lower cost entry. Maybe a better chance of someone making nice 3d printed case to house everything and a speaker in an Alexa-like enclosure as well.	jsheets	t3_609nwj

I'm owner of UX303LB laptop, and it, while having a little outdated and less capable CPU, beats UX330 in some details. It has same screen with same resolution, same weight and dimensions, but it has 4Gb RAM on the motherboard with additional DIMM slot so you can have up to 12, if you need so, and, more important, it has dedicated graphics (yeah, I know, it's only 940M with 2Gb, but still).

t3_63t3do	t1_dfww3nj	1491494138	Microsoft can have the most powerful system but if they don't have any games there's nothing Sony is worried about. Sony is killing 'em with exclusive titles right now.	kirbyfox312	t1_dfwsq28
t3_63t3do	t1_dfwwraf	1491494824	More exclusives don't necessarily mean better games. If every game I want to play exists on both consoles and the Scorpio plays those multi-plat titles better, then I would get the Scorpio, especially considering I vastly prefer the Xbox controllers to the PS controllers. The only exclusives I like on either side are Halo, Forza, and I'm drooling over that new Spiderman game. But The Last of Us, Horizon Zero-Dawn, and the other PS4 exclusives don't interest me all that much. As long as Scorpio has Halo, Forza, Shadow of Mordor, and Mass Effect, I'm a happy camper :)	stevenmcountryman2	t1_dfww3nj
t3_63t3do	t1_dfwwz2l	1491495048	Yeah it's super fun to manually turn on my tv, get up from my bed, walk to my PC, turn it on, sign into it, launch Steam, launch Steam big picture mode, then launch a game from there to have full controller support (if the game supports it at all), and then go back to my bed to play games without HDR support.   That's all muchhhh better than just reaching over to my nightstand, pressing the xbox button on my controller, having it auto turn on my xbox and tv, then clicking the "A" button to auto launch my last game in full HDR glory and having easy two-button access to invite friends to party chat, record game clips, and switch to other games/apps.	stevenmcountryman2	t1_dfwv7cz
t3_63t3do	t1_dfwx3yi	1491495186	1: remotes exist for TVs, 2: steam pcs exist 3: the increase in quality makes the downsides moot in comparison 4: steam controller exists (its compatible with EVERY game)	RedSolarflareRuby	t3_63t3do
t3_63t3do	t1_dfwxmwj	1491495731	Not really.  They're still releasing most games on PC.  There aren't that many exclusives and anyone who wanted to use 4k would already have a decent PC.  PS4 still has the advantage for exclusives.    I'm still not convinced this will be able to do native 4k without some wonky checker boarding shit.	walrus_of_fate	t1_dfwsq28
t3_63t3do	t1_dfx0zfz	1491499161	What's the most interesting ils that the GPU has 40 compute units, which means it's more powerful than the RX 480(32CUs), and isnt a Polaris chip. Meaning it's a cut Vega, or a bigger Polaris. Edit: As u/Hustleman420 said and as I did some more research, this seems to be a fully custom SOC based on TSMC's 16nm mode , having a dedicated decoder/encoder to cut in half CPU load based on draw calls being processed under DX12, which in itself, is very interesting.

t3_63kstd	t1_dfx4d41	1491502628	&gt;Wang predicts that this new self-healing material will be used for phone screens and batteries by 2020.      Wang should probably stick to chemistry and leave the predictions to other experts.	iushciuweiush	t3_63kstd
t3_63t3do	t1_dfx6csa	1491504742	Let's do the math here. Let's say worst case scenario that Scorpio is $500.  PC:  GPU $200 RAM $100 CPU $120 MOBO $80   Cool we're at $500 and don't even have a functioning PC, let alone one that can do 4K. Scorpio may not be able to compete with high end gaming PCs but it seems like it will offer a value to someone who doesn't want to invest $1000+.	AvoidingIowa	t1_dfwv7cz

t3_63t3do	t1_dfxc19d	1491510851	In the console race, Sony is doing just fine.

t3_63nbz5	t1_dfxiues	1491519153	True enough. That's a lot of tax, though. On the other hand I sometimes see games being sold for "£40 or $50USD or 50€". Try and make sense of that lol	Ya-Dikobraz	t1_dfxhvtn

t3_63nbz5	t1_dfzloha	1491631766	I got the 2015 version, still going strong. I'm a computer science major, meaning I use it a shit ton to consume media and do a lot of programming. It handles Android Studio, PHP Storm, Visual Studio, Photoshop, and X2go like a champ. Many of times I have some or all these programs running at the same time. The RAM is a life saver for the laptop! The battery life is great, as long as I'm not doing more intensive things obviously. I can get a solid 8-10 hours doing shit on the web maybe a little less when developing. This line of computers is great and would definitely recommend them.	Zadye2	t3_63nbz5
t3_63nbz5	t1_dfzv6wi	1491659054	I submitted mine for this exact issue after 10 months. They claimed that it was not a manufacturing issue but that I had used it improperly.

t3_64jkbq	t1_dg2npte	1491834385	I have a neighbour who just bought one of those. No, a 5 minute youtube video doesn't cut it.

t3_64jkbq	t1_dg2p7ok	1491836156	If kodi is the only OS on the box then yes, that actually IS difficult. But any android based media device would update automatically. Which by the way I don't think its wise to update that often.  Kodi is a good product but their definition of "stable" can sometimes be a stretch.	Hemmer83	t1_dg2npte
t3_64jkbq	t1_dg2pafq	1491836245	Are they insanely overpriced on Amazon? You can get them for as low as $25 from Chinese retailers. At least that's what a friend paid a year ago for an admittedly outdated Android 4.4/1GB RAM/8GB storage box with pre-installed Kodi. But it gets the job done for 1080p media and runs RetroArch fairly well.	Hal_Nein_Thousand	t1_dg2lour

t3_64jkbq	t1_dg33x43	1491851943	They're cracking down on resellers, guys who buy the devices, install Kodi and some pirate plugins, and resell for a big markup.

t3_64jkbq	t1_dg3zjxs	1491895007	Like I said, you should not be updating kodi that often. Android boxes are not like Apple, every box has slightly different hardware that is going to run into different compatibility issues. If its running alright and you're not on a several year old version of kodi don't bother updating.	Hemmer83	t1_dg3xg25

t3_64jkbq	t1_dg49jjm	1491918214	&gt;Which most people use for Kodi anyways.  Not accurate ***at all***.  Most people using Kodi with FireTV (Or some other product) is not the same thing as most FireTV users buying it for Kodi.  There is a disconnect between people (like us) who use Kodi and the general public, we get this idea that "everyone" knows and uses Kodi (or whatever our favorite is) because we surround ourselfs with like minds and it's simply not true.  The vast majority of FireTV owners do not have Kodi installed. They do not even know what it is. Reddit (and other sites) are a bubble. You can get 10,000 posts on Kodi and assume "well, everyone is using it".  As for reasons to what Amazon does...  Amazon has their own ecosystem, they want "us" to buy media from "them".  It is a business move and a smart one. Not selling rival devices is just as "smart". (relatively speaking). If they "allow" easy and wanton access to pirating, their media delivery business suffers.  Here's the thing, they do not care about FireTV hardware sales, so pissing "you" off (or inconveniencing you) by doing something that might hurt or limit your ability to pirate can only benefit them, not hurt them, as some (not you) will be more apt to purchase content rather than pirate it and if you do not, it's still not a loss.  It's amazing to me how logic and reason are discarded by some people when it comes to business decisions. It is literally not about "you". Your decision to maybe not buy the next FireTV has absolutely zero effect on Amazon.   Pats self on back..."Haha they fucked themselves didn't they".  Nope. They most certainly didn't.	lostintransactions	t1_dg2pwgx
t3_64i4r1	t1_dg4ag28	1491919395	Yeah I havent heard too much bad news about them. Any idea where might be the cheapest?	suckseggs	t1_dg4a3n8
t3_64jkbq	t1_dg4c4mj	1491921476	Can you prove that most fire tv users don't use kodi?  You think retailers are selling out of fire tv sticks nationwide because of the amazon prime service?  Don't be dilusional.	staplesdude	t1_dg49jjm

t3_64i4r1	t1_dg72d4m	1492053553	Hey Everybody,  I'm having a little bit of difficulty finding a piece of equipment, and could use a little bit of advice.  What I'm looking for is, ideally, [like this.](http://usb.brando.com/micro-sd-hc-trio-3-in-1-card-reader-ii_p02865c031d15.html)  The critical factor here is that it fits into an SD card holder.    As far as I can tell, however, no one seems to still be making those.  So, if that is true, another thing that would work would be a Micro SD to USB adapter that has a similar form factor to an SD card, again so it can fit in an SD card holder well.  Barring all of that, a flash drive that fits in an SD card holder would also work.  Sorry if my post seems rather scattered, I'm a bit frazzled after looking for so long.  Any help you would be able to provide would be greatly appreciated.  Additionally, this is my first post, so if I broke some written (or unwritten) rules, or put this in the wrong place or something, please, mock me mercilessly, I can take it.  Thank you again.

t3_6577r5	t1_dg8bnfm	1492121906	I've always thought that high write speeds came from high rpm.this is a 5400 rpm drive. Why not just use a 10k drive?	seanbrockest	t3_6577r5
t3_6577r5	t1_dg8cwzk	1492123578	RPM is only half the story, the other half is data density. A 1TB drive at 5400RPM is much faster than a 250GB drive at the same speed. With more capacity at the same size, data is packed into a smaller area and the head passes over more data in the same amount of time. I'm not sure how exactly much it benefits random reads, but for linear stuff (big files on non-fragmented disks), you get faster and bigger drives in the same move.  I'm don't know the full reasoning for not going full 10K speed, but it's likely that high capacity HDD's like in the article are "fast enough" for most business purposes, 10K wears the drive motor out much faster, and high capacity SSD's are slowly moving into that market segment.  Edit: Read the article again, noticed it says the drive is aimed at surveillance workloads. 5400RPM is definitely fast enough for the job, faster would just needlessly waste drive lifetime.	bakagamedev	t1_dg8bnfm

t3_6577r5	t1_dg8elzr	1492125836	Purple is designed to write data quick and also last longer. A surveillance system HD runs non-stop so the purples are designed to run all the time without burning out. However, since they are only writing video data, their focus does not need to be on writing that data very accurately. With a pc it's very important for data to be written very accurately as it's constantly writing data from different types of  files on the system. WD Black, and other pc HDs are designed to focus more on accuracy but are not great at running 24-7 without giving out.	kabycd	t3_6577r5

It was very expensive back in the day but it has been so worth it, the thing was beautiful back then and still kind of is. The backlighting is getting dimmer though so it's near end of life, but I'm very tempted to splurge on another Ultrasharp.	Grummond	t1_dg8791c
t3_655f52	t1_dg8kyyl	1492134526	Good thing I'd never run 1080p with 27 inch screens, I don't want to notice individual pixels ;)   I'm looking at the 24 inch dell ultrasharp U2415, apparently it can run for as low as $250, so dual panels, IPS, accurate amazing color, and 16:10 for around $600.  My other option was the 27 inch ASUS PB278Q, a color accurate, but LCD instead of IPS, 1440p panel for $400. I wouldn't be able to afford two at one time, so I'd eventually buy another one. I'm just afraid of the colors looking odd due to panels aging at different times.	nndttttt	t1_dg8j7w4
t3_655f52	t1_dg8lbvb	1492135023	I was considering getting the PB278Q aswell. Figured the IPS(?) was a good upgrade for my current all TN tri monitor setup but i wanted to get a 144hz panel. God damn does 144hz make a difference though. Almost life changing. And the color accuracy is quite well with the main VG278HV i have in the center of the setup.

t3_655f52	t1_dg8yc17	1492161445	If it was an LG panel, then Dell is getting a *very* nice profit margin.  The B6 65" OLED TV also costs $3500 and, instead of a single 65" panel, LG instead made four 30" panels, then one would expect that the price of each 30" panel would be less than half the price of a single 65" panel.

t3_64i4r1	t1_dg94a5j	1492176190	I'm looking to buying a tablet with pen support (not a capacitive stylus, but smth like S Pen or Apple pencil). In size it should be about 10" with the standard 4:3 aspect ratio, since I find it better than the widescreen one (but I guess I could manage 12" widescreen, too). I really appreciate portability, battery life, and the longevity of software support (it can either mean it's going to be a Windows tablet, or an Android w/ LineageOS support, etc.).  I would like to use it in my academic life (electronic study materials, articles), to be able to manage some of my computers if needed (teamviewer is really appreciated), and to draw sometimes.  What good tablets are to be found in this niche? So far I found the Tab S3 (good stuff, but the quirks of Android, and relatively few tablet-optimised apps, for about 680$+cover), the Ipad Pro 9.7 (good stuff, but the 100$ for the pen hurts a lot, also does the lack of expendability, for about 680$+cover+pen+apple tax), and nothing else. The Windows tabs I found were definitely bigger and heavier: the TabPro S, the Miix 510 (both for about 850$), and the Surface devices (for about 300$ more in my country).	Nashtore	t3_64i4r1

t3_655f52	t1_dg9nauz	1492199338	The resolution is independent of the panel size - the 55" OLED and the 65" OLED are both 4k, yet the 65" costs 50%+ more.  30 + 30 does not equal 65, but you don't need it to be exact since, as I said, panel size and resolution are independent of one-another.

t3_64i4r1	t1_dg9sjby	1492205762	Hello, I'm rocking a Sony MDR-ZX 330BT here. So far I found it to have a nice audio quality, with a little drop in the volume of the bass. No distortion is to be heard, though.  It is quite small, and also features a mic. When using the mic, the audio quality drops to GSM-like (I guess the bluetooth bandwidth isn't enough). I guess that it's the same with all the other headsets (can't confirm).   Battery life is a week (I listen to about 4-5hrs music a day, so I guess its above the advertised 30 hrs). What sucks is that the charging is slow (2-3 hrs), and the headphone jack is omitted. Nor is audio via usb. So when the battery dies, the headphone can't be used, which sux.  The price? Regularly 99$, bought mine for around 60$. Pretty much a steal, I love it, despite its shortcomings.	Nashtore	t1_dg9jhs2

t3_65l1f1	t1_dgbbjyd	1492297779	You can't control a drone perfectly.  These sliders are about perfectly controlled and timed movement at a constant pace for smooth shots.  Drones are good for a lot of stuff but smooth footage over small movement distances are not it (well not without very expensive drones with advanced stabilization).  Also what's easier? A bit of wood you slide, or programming a drone. You can carry that slider around with you set it up and take your shot in seconds.  And a drone often needs permission. I mean you tend to upset people trying to use a drone inside buildings.	StarkyA	t1_dgbawaj
t3_65l1f1	t1_dgbbnhb	1492297922	I would probably prefer a drone outdoor as well. But in my country it means you need to get special permission the fly it in a city, so a small portable slider has to do the job.

t3_64i4r1	t1_dgbo4ku	1492316282	So when it comes to processors, higher GHz is better. Gigahertz measures how many instructions a processor can run a second.   1 instruction a second would be 1 hertz. But there are 1 billion hertz in a GHz so a computer with a a 3.8GHz processor can perform 3.8 billion instructions a second. Likewise a computer with a 2.7GHz processor can only (only, lol) process 2.7 billion instructions a second.  I don't work in the industry, so I have no idea what that means in terms of practical application other than it's what makes your computer fast or slow.

t3_65vmah	t1_dgdjsvf	1492439673	I am trying to figure out a justification for this and I can't. I would need to buy a special printer in order to apply a skin to my iPhone - something that I can already do by hand.

t3_65vmah	t1_dgdkj8u	1492440624	I won't pay anything for it on Craigslist because it is faster to buy a skin and apply it myself. At a fair, I might pay the $9 that a regular skin costs. Maybe $10 for the novelty of watching a machine skin my phone.	Sylanthra	t1_dgdk51n

t3_65vmah	t1_dgdmzqz	1492443591	So if it costs $800 (I have no clue), and you're selling skins for $10 (you can probably sell for more, even though people can get it at a better price, just because of the gimicky gimick of it).  Each skin will cost:  * $1 electricity (ignore this if you're doing craft fairs, because electricity is usually included in booth rent) * $2 vinyl material (??  I have never even owned a 3D printer) * If you pay an employee to run it and handle money $12/hr and you can do 10 skins per hour (5 minutes each plus some downtime between) that's $1.20/skin labor  $5.80 profit per skin  Machine will pay itself off in 138 skins, assuming no maintenance or breakdowns.  That'd probably 2 or 3 craft fairs that you make no profit while the machine pays itself off.  Then you can make $464 per craft fair minus booth rent.  Edit: Someone says $299 according to their website (but out of stock).  So it would pay itself off after 51 skins.	skyroket	t1_dgdkj8u
t3_65vmah	t1_dgdp0y4	1492445910	Seems a little impractical when you can just buy a skin for like $8.	unscot	t3_65vmah

t3_65vmah	t1_dgdt7tc	1492450568	Charge $9.99 per wrap. Have a very simple booth that has 2 flat screen TV's on either side of the booth playing a video of the machine working and when a machine starts it cuts over to a live video of the phone being printed on.  Minus the cost of rental for the space and the cost of cartridges (which it says is a 3M product) you could make the cost of the machine itself back in 30 sales.	_____FRESH_____	t1_dgdm1j7

I have a couple of projects that might be considered fringe and have been looking for the right partners:  - an app that tells you if you need more toilet paper -- you take a picture of your TP roll and it gives you a bunch of information, like how many movements you have until you need another, etc. It can be connected to an online purchase source so you never run out of TP again! Imagine, reaching for that last sheet, but hearing the doorbell that signals your new 12-pack has arrived! [We will also make a special "diaper" (but it's not a real diaper) that you can wear to retrieve the new TP delivery and make it back to the toilet without embarassment.]  - a device that tells you if it is daytime! Yes, if you are ever uncertain, use this device to let you know that it is, indeed, daytime. (I am working through the logistics now for a night time version, stay tuned!)  I know these are revolutionary ideas that are going to make a lot of people uncomfortable (down with toilet tech and all that), and not many poeple will see their value, but I think this team is just the right one to help me move these projects to the next level!

t3_64i4r1	t1_dgirvug	1492705878	About the price of the tab s3. The iPad pro with pencil is a little bit too much (considering it already includes apple tax, and pencil tax).   So, about 600$, if I were in the us market. Unfortunately, some great devices never make it to my country (ehm, surface), and some make it so much pricier (ehm, miix tablets and tab pro s). So I was just wondering, if I should stick with the tab s3 (yea it's a tablet and 600$, but the wacom+amoled combo makes me want to buy it), or is there a better option for much cheaper ( the price of it covers many great laptops in my country, even gaming pcs which I find to be more useful).   I guess I can wait a little, until fall anyway. New surface devices and iPad pro 9.7 refresh is expected, alongside with tab s3 price drops (the initial reviews weren't so warm). I hope that I can buy a surface device (if finally they come to my country), I like windows on tablets so much more than android and iOS!	Nashtore	t1_dgiof3u

t3_66h1v8	t1_dgix75s	1492711518	This is fucking hilarious. I remember a year ago when [no one fell for this shit either, this is just the cherry on top.](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/31/11337444/juicero-wifi-connected-smart-juicer-is-ridiculous)	hatramroany	t3_66h1v8
t3_66h1v8	t1_dgiyaff	1492712693	I kind of don't expect to see anyone cut these things open anytime soon.  Seeing as how you have to buy the machine to buy the bags, I probably wouldn't be keen to prove to myself what a sucker I was after blowing that kind of money.	thelivinlegend	t1_dgiu5pm
t3_66h1v8	t1_dgiypwd	1492713164	This seems a bit made up, I'm not falling for it.	YoureProbablyATwat	t1_dgipn38
t3_66h1v8	t1_dgizatj	1492713797	that juice came out way to easy on that bloomberg video. i'm betting these bags are pre filled with juice or severely liquified produce. no way there are large chunks of fruit or vegetables in there!	mikespry	t3_66h1v8
t3_663brx	t1_dgizsrl	1492714341	Why would you buy an iPhone if already is released obsolete?	sn0wr4in	t1_dgi6e2t
t3_64i4r1	t1_dgizxp3	1492714489	Check Yiynova MVP22U(V3) or Nexus 7. As for laptop, Acer Aspire E5-575G-53VG is quite nice, or if you want to squize few bucks, get one without SSD, you can always put 1 later (it is easy, PCM or CompTech subreddit can help you. Or contact me). Also chech Huion brand, my friends have few of their drawing boards, they are good, and they have tablets that run Win.	nebojssha	t1_dgirvug

t3_66a70i	t1_dgj38jc	1492718043	I wish people would boycott this product on general principle, but I'm sure it will sell like crazy... Hurray for another Christmas season of mini consoles nobody can buy!	GoldfishTX	t3_66a70i
t3_66h1v8	t1_dgj3btp	1492718137	You can do the squeezing yourself, but it's more fun to let the local massage parlor do the squeezing for you for $100.	ContractorConfusion	t3_66h1v8

t3_66h1v8	t1_dgjhuri	1492735566	Youre wrong. The bag contains the juice already, thats why you can squeeze it by hand. There is some produce in it but that only accounts for 0.5oz of the content.   So it is a machine that squeezes LIQUID juice from a bag filled with ALREADY LIQUID JUICE.	Wonderingaboutsth1	t1_dgim5qs
t3_66h1v8	t1_dgjhxtx	1492735668	This is exactly it. This sub is making me angry, everyone here keeps missing the point.  The product is exactly what you just said. The bag has almost only already liquid juice and very, very little produce (0.5oz).   That is why you can squeeze it with your hands. Why isnt this sub getting it?	Wonderingaboutsth1	t1_dgis3al
t3_66h1v8	t1_dgji0u3	1492735765	You need to scan the QR code of the toilet paper before it lets you use it to ensure its a branded, official toilet paper! You dont want no non-branded ones!	Wonderingaboutsth1	t1_dgirop6
t3_66h1v8	t1_dgjilup	1492736493	I'm just relaying what I read about the product.  I'm assuming they put some kind of solid in there in case someone actually looks at what's in the bag so it's not too obvious.  That it's already juiced would also account for the ridiculous markup on the 8 oz serving as well.	thelivinlegend	t1_dgjhuri
t3_66h1v8	t1_dgjrvrj	1492748906	All it is is juice in a bag, there isn't a fruit in there that it squeezes.  It's a $400 pair of hands.	TrumpItPlaya	t1_dgjilup
t3_66h1v8	t1_dgjs185	1492749177	It's not smashing fruit, it's smashing a bag, that has liquid inside of it.	TrumpItPlaya	t1_dgin4rt
t3_66h1v8	t1_dgjtw3m	1492752867	Yeah but the maid already has a hard job, she can use the machine, it's cool.	smilbandit	t3_66h1v8
t3_66h1v8	t1_dgjv1mf	1492755472	I actually see the attraction of this device for someone wealthy enough to afford the machine and the packs which are delivered fresh and chilled to your door at regular intervals in insulated boxes.  You are paying for the convenience of not having to shop for fruits and vegetables, wash, cut, measure out the appropriate amount of each to create a specific juice blend, store the unused portion, methodically manually feed pieces into a juicer, dispose of the remaining fiber and clean the juicer, all of which are time consuming.  For someone who will buy this system, their time is worth more than the $400 device and $6 - $8 per drink. But for most of us, this seems like an insane expense.	macbrett	t3_66h1v8
t3_6577r5	t1_dgjy16c	1492763936	Maybe it's also easier to sell something that's marketed with "helium".  It's a bit more exotic sounding than nitrogen. But I'm just speculating now.	centristtt	t1_dgjgp3v
t3_663brx	t1_dgjze80	1492768231	How is it obsolete? I bought a HTC One M7 when it came out and it's still running perfectly fine.	DARDAN0S	t1_dgi6e2t
t3_663brx	t1_dgk314t	1492777068	Why would I want to buy an Android when it isn't equipped with dongles and wastes so much space with a 3.5mm headphone jack?  Seriously,  I crave the innovation, and courage that's standard with Apple.	pachydermusrex	t1_dgi6e2t
t3_663brx	t1_dgkag7t	1492787374	It's their right sure - but the software is inferior and people are forced to use it / not aware of an alternative. also their products suck. show me 1 galaxy phone ever that doesnt run hot	LazarusLong1981	t1_dgk8m8y
t3_663brx	t1_dgkcgto	1492789658	You can update to the last Android? No you can't. With my two years old iPhone I can update to the last iOS, that's the difference.	Benja1016	t1_dgjze80
t3_663brx	t1_dgkdnm8	1492791008	Do I really care? I can phone people, email, text, take decent pictures and video, emulate Gameboy and DS games, listen to music and browse the Internet. Other than a fingerprint scanner what can newer phones do that mine can't?	DARDAN0S	t1_dgkcgto
t3_663brx	t1_dgkjhyj	1492797533	I'm happy with my phone, you are happy with yours. I don't like Android phones, you have any problem with that?	Benja1016	t1_dgkdnm8
t3_663brx	t1_dgkk3vr	1492798244	Nobody is forced to use their software. And all phones run hot. That's what phones do	tophusurvivor	t1_dgkag7t
t3_663brx	t1_dgkkthy	1492799056	some phones run much much hotter than others. like samsung phones. iphones for example run much cooler. My newest android phone runs much cooler than my previous samsung phone  on my note, if I want to wake up the phone from sleep with my voice - it can only open the samsung assistant. I can not say "ok google" and have it open google now. It defaults to the assistant, requiring an app, "switch for s voice" to work. I think this has since been changed but this is just one example of MANY. fuck samsung. worse than windows mobile 6.5 imo	LazarusLong1981	t1_dgkk3vr

t3_66uuvy	t1_dglgxzf	1492847684	If goes with the fingerprint, the sensor can also stop working with the same case :D what about that?	oliviaeva	t1_dglgvjr
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglhnhk	1492849929	Wait, is that actually a thing?   Edit: or was that a roast that I just picked up on	BaileyJaydon	t1_dglgvjr
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglkmci	1492859927	How does fave scan work? If someone steals your phone from you can they unlock it by pointing it at you? Like a TSA agent?	thefranster	t3_66uuvy
t3_66uuvy	t1_dgll8lr	1492861646	Gets even "better": The last time I tried face scan, I was able to use my employee ID badge to unlock my phone, even though that's supposedly not possible. I'll be sticking with fingerprint.	GoodShitLollypop	t1_dglkmci
t3_66uuvy	t1_dgllfhq	1492862158	Man, get a one plus. Probably one of the best Android phones out there.	lilgas52	t3_66uuvy
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglmaww	1492864341	Password is the best.  You can't be forced to unlock phone by police its covered under the 5th but your finger print isn't.	Slingenink	t3_66uuvy
t3_66uuvy	t1_dgln2fz	1492866110	Yeah, unless you're a drug dealer I don't see the point tho	thisiswilli	t1_dglmaww
t3_66uuvy	t1_dgln6ty	1492866376	The iris scanner is neat but honestly I use more to show off my cool new toy than anything.  The finger print unlock is perfect for me.  My finger naturally rests right on top of that thing when I pick up my phone so to me it is like it is never locked, but for anyone else it is.  Also you can get it to use your finger print to remember other passwords which is cool.	Kahoots113	t3_66uuvy
t3_66uuvy	t1_dgln8l8	1492866478	Don't use the fingerprint scanner. Its so inconveniently placed...  However I find it to quite easy use. So much fuss, do little adjustment.	bertinthesuburbs	t3_66uuvy
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglnafr	1492866585	Yeah I read that most photos will unlock it. That's kind of absurd for me. Imagine any agency taking your photo, any criminal taking from your social media, etc	thefranster	t1_dgll8lr
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglnnc6	1492867324	I use the power button. Faster and simple to remember	godzillabobber	t3_66uuvy
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglnyyk	1492867975	I love my S8. She brightens everytime when she sees my face, if I stare at her or if I touch her in the right place.	Landoostic	t3_66uuvy
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglodjr	1492868759	I use Iris or pattern when I'm out. I also have phone set to be auto unlocked when I'm home or in my car on Bluetooth. After just the setup of the fingerprint sensor I knew I wanted nothing to do with that.	Joker03XX	t3_66uuvy
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglp6n7	1492870206	I believe the point would be a right to privacy	Mafia_Bob	t1_dgln2fz
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglphbg	1492870714	These are all neat... but how's it's explosive power?	bozzy253	t3_66uuvy
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglpspm	1492871235	Let's be real, if you are using anything except a long password *only available in your head* you aren't using this to prevent dedicated criminals with all your personal info from unlocking your phone.  And let's also be real, if the criminal has physical access to any normal phone he can probably get into it. Relying on your unlock screen is foolhardy if you are insisting on strong security.	krispygrem	t1_dglnafr
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglpyvd	1492871520	Password the rest of that shit will only work 50% of the time	Cat-Hax	t3_66uuvy

t3_66uuvy	t1_dglquzb	1492872936	I'm not sure how s8 works but on an iPhone 3 wrong attempts and passcode is required. Also if you restart phone. So, in this case just powerdown your phone if police approach. Or, give 3 wrong fingers or bad placements. It would be so annoying for me to have to type six digits 20 times an hour...	Nomandate	t1_dglmaww
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglqw05	1492872982	This is known as "the stupidest argument ever" when it comes to personal privacy.	Nomandate	t1_dgln2fz
t3_66h1v8	t1_dglqw4k	1492872987	Amusingly, chopping the fruit/veg impairs its freshness, since it exposes all the inner surfaces that the skin usually protects.  It is packed in a bag, of course, but still...	etherealeminence	t1_dgim5qs
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglvgn6	1492879578	I *kinda* get what they're saying. I don't think this is the stupid "Why would I mind? I don't have anything to hide" logic. I think it's more like: "I lock my bathroom door because I want privacy even though I'm not doing anything wrong, but installing a deadbolt seems like overkill."  I don't necessarily agree, but I think there's a difference in the two thoughts.	-Badger2-	t1_dglqw05

t3_66uuvy	t1_dglyd4k	1492883448	Only Windows Hello can detect twins and photos and reject them, because it doesn't just do facial recognition, it does depth of field and infrared scanning to make sure it's actually you. Phones are too small to pack that tech, so they're far less secure.	stevenmcountryman2	t1_dgll8lr
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglyict	1492883632	They had a phone app to launch ships in Ancient Greece. Helen of Troy's phone was hacked, when she looked at her it, she launched a thousand ships.	MasterFubar	t1_dglgvjr
t3_66uuvy	t1_dglyqq1	1492883919	Yes, although I don't know about you, I however have never randomly had to have my phone checked by police.	Natheeeh	t1_dglp6n7
t3_66uuvy	t1_dgm1zdf	1492888310	Guess we'll be hearing plenty of these every time Samsung releases something.	Noodles_fluffy	t1_dglphbg
t3_66uuvy	t1_dgm2dhw	1492888838	The point is that such considerations are irrelevant for most people. The reason why most of us have security settings on our phone is to prevent criminals access, not prevent police access.	kremfjes	t1_dglqw05
t3_66h1v8	t1_dgm2wfu	1492889560	I saw the video where a bag got cut open. It was full of stuff that looked like somebody had chewed up and spat out into the bag. Pre-chewed for your convenience. If I chew my own food would that expose me to a copyright enforcement action? Huge rooms of professional pre-chewers, chewing and spitting all day, only to get outsourced by those cheaper Mexican chewers, or even the vast Chinese pre-chew factories! Trump save us!	mzp1001	t3_66h1v8
t3_663brx	t1_dgm3nrg	1492890592	As someone with an iPhone, I think you have some apple bias. That screen really is something cool. The rest of it seems good, but the screen is stand out. I hope the next iPhone does the same design, with even less bezel.	syntheticcfm	t1_dgj5j8w

t3_670phq	t1_dgms3mp	1492926205	Has anyone used it IRL and compared it to actual capacitive/digitizer displays?  AFAIK Microsoft began the Surface project with light detection just like this AirBar, but scrapped it because it wasn't good enough. They only resurrected the Surface project after the iPad (&amp; it's capacitive touchscreen) became popular.	H4xolotl	t3_670phq
t3_670phq	t1_dgmt60e	1492928490	From the reviews it seems that it works on a very limited number of computers.	AmericanKamikaze	t3_670phq
t3_670phq	t1_dgmu9df	1492931155	I would guess that the lack of pressure sensor is a limitation. Having tried such systems with and without the pressure sensor, it makes a really big difference (to draw, but also just to write).	sphks	t1_dgms3mp
t3_670phq	t1_dgmuqpa	1492932446	if the location is precise, it could work very well with a pen that senses pressure. it could be a game changer if it is accurate because touch screens for drawing cost like 400 dollars for a cheap 21inch one.	pigscantfly00	t1_dgms3mp

t3_670phq	t1_dgmyc5q	1492943578	I actually bought one, and it is reasonable accurate. It is sometimes difficult to close windows or stuff like that, but for scrolling and other generally non precise tasks it is fine	NoOutsideObservers	t1_dgms3mp

If your mouse freezes due to poor construction  (it's a common issue on Toshiba laptops, which usually is easily fixed by refreshing the screen) or much more seriously, malware, you can still use your finger to search for a way to alleviate the problem, among other uses.

t3_670phq	t1_dgn1276	1492951138	Completely a tangent but would you happen to know how touch screen yeah was implemented in the CRT monitor days?  My local library had one as a kid and it blew my mind having not even owned a PC let alone finding out I could touch the screen to move the mouse.  It looked the exact same monitor wise as the other three computers they had but it had touch capability and your post reminded me of that memory    Edit: apologies to whoever down voted me for asking a semi related question?   Edit 2: Thanks everyone for the wealth of knowledge and  helping me satisfy a childhood curiosity!

t3_670phq	t1_dgn1mj8	1492952444	I have one and actually forget it is a touchscreen until someone touches it and it moves.    It makes sense in a flip-style laptop that folds flat to become a tablet but It is absolutely useless in a standard laptop.	PintoTheBurninator	t1_dgmve54
t3_670phq	t1_dgn1p18	1492952597	Thanks! That's exactly the one I'm looking at. Do you think it would be a good investment for a casual/hobby use, or should I save my money and stick with a cheaper wacom tablet without the display?	cuddlefucker	t1_dgn1jtx
t3_670phq	t1_dgn1vrp	1492952997	Resistive mostly. Even early smart phones had resistive touch screens.   There were a few products that used light similar to this, but it completely surrounded the monitor and had a grid of lights and sensors on opposite sides of the screens.	solnear65	t1_dgn1276
t3_670phq	t1_dgn1yqi	1492953168	Decent. I use it on my second monitor to adjust volume levels and over settings mostly. YouTube's website is really good for touch though so I'll use it for selecting another video as well	SomeGuyWithABible	t1_dgn1vsp

t3_670phq	t1_dgn2fi0	1492954107	Look up reviews of monoprice tablets vs Wacom. They're pretty comparable, and without the Wacom price, they're more accessible to beginners.   I would say to start with the cheapest of either line that meets what you're looking for in a tablet (drawing area size, macro buttons) — which may be either one. Then once you start wanting something more, do a lot more research into all the options at that time and choose what sounds best to you. I made the mistake of jumping straight into an expensive intuos, and now I only draw on my Surface because it's inconvenient to drag out a huge external tablet all the time in my current situation.	spiralcall	t1_dgn2217

t3_670phq	t1_dgn2jfm	1492954318	Because Node.js support is garbage on Windows. (admittedly getting better with recent Bash for Windows updates).  Mac is a very popular choice for front end developers because it gives you virtually all the development advantages of running Linux combined with companies that actually develop software for it.  If I didn't have to work with designers who worked in Adobe suite / Sketch / etc, I would probably just code in Linux.  Unless you're doing game development or like ASP, Mac is definitely a better well rounded choice.	intoxxx	t1_dgn21lu

As for navigation as people are suggesting to owning a touch device yet to find how good it is to use when we have keyboard shortcuts.

t3_670phq	t1_dgn8hyo	1492963638	Actually, on CRT you don't need resistive touchscreens at all. On a CRT you have a scanning electron beam, while it moves faster than your eye could detect at every single point in time there's just a dot present on the screen, the dot moves along line per line forming the image. Light pens abused this to get cheap touch recognition, the pen itself only detects light, when you put it on the screen it will see black except for the moment when the dot is passing exactly where the pen is, thus determining where the user is pointing. The downside is it's not the most precise thing in the world, and only works on CRTs, but it was super cheap and a pen would work on any monitor.	kadupse	t1_dgn1zcj

t3_670phq	t1_dgn9rrb	1492965322	To be honest, I'm not into the art community, and I don't know at what point you consider someone an experienced professional. [Here's a review from Frenden](http://frenden.com/post/31659364200/the-little-monoprice-graphics-tablet-that-could) - he takes clients and is a digital illustrator by trade.  You can google for comparison articles, as well as reviews for either tablet brand specifically, and get a variety of opinions. They're regularly positive for both sides, but their conclusions depend what models you're looking at. Comparing a $400 intuos to a $50 entry-level monoprice? Probably not a fair contest.  If you're looking for a professional option, it's going to be a bit subjective, and I'm definitely not in any sort of position to tell you what's better. If you're really looking for something to use as a daily, commercial driver, it's worth doing your homework on to choose the quirks that work best for you and your work flow.	spiralcall	t1_dgn8m5j

t3_66uuvy	t1_dgovkzc	1493054161	It was a while ago, not much he can do now. And even if he did, the chances of that particular cop getting more aggressive outweigh the prospect of getting home and forgetting about it.   I've dealt with police a few times, sometimes by nice cops, one who let my friends go for speeding after we complied with him, and a cop who helped me out when I was a poorer youth in a bad environment. I have had less-than-favorable cops, like two who made me "shut up" by saying that I was clearly on heroin and that they would take me in if I resisted a ticket for vending without a lisence. And a cop who pulled me over and told me to put my hands up because I was "suspiciously going into an apartment and back out a number of times" one morning (though he chilled out as it progressed, I pretty much got stopped for going in my house).   You learn to hope for the best, and keep your mouth shut in case you're dealing with the worst. In my brother-in-law's example, it's not worth fighting. You want to get home. You take the embarrassment and move on. No reason to fight a losing battle for the sake of a cop possibly getting disciplined in the far future.   But back to the point, I don't think cops are always looking out for my well being. I've had too many situations where they've been needlessly aggressive, or prodded when they had no right to. I've heard of too many stories from family and friends who were wronged by cops, or ignored completely when they did need them. And I see too many stories where the populace automatically sided with the police instead of investigating the story further because authority = righteousness. Anyone can be a bad person, a badge does not make you a good. But good luck getting a court to hear you out on that one.   I never feel like the law is on my side, especially when it's the law enforcers who are seemingly invincible.	SickTwistedWorld	t1_dgou6f6

t3_678jmj	t1_dgqe4nw	1493136046	Are you going to get features that even a cheap chromebook purchased today will get, like the ability to use Android apps? Or just security updates? My friend's​ Pixel LTE was purchased for over $1,000 less than 3 years ago (new ones are still being sold on ebay) but it won't get the new features. When an OS has to be custom tailored for each different hardware configuration this is bound to happen. It's bad enough that the support cycles for phones are so short, now we are starting to see the same with laptops.	DopePedaller	t1_dgpw3az

t3_678jmj	t1_dgqqo21	1493149318	Mine has 32GB. An installation of linux takes ~1GB and all my standard apps take up ~6GB and my dropbox folder with personal files is 6GB so i still have 19GB free for misc stuff which is fine for me. Some chomebooks have replaceable SSDs but it is getting rarer nowadays sadly.  Most basic stuff takes up way less storage space than you'd think. Libreoffice is just a few hundred MB and so is firefox/chome which is the only application some people use. If you would be doing something heavy like gaming, modelling in cad or video editing why would you even consider a chromebook? If you have a lot of pictures on your camera you can put those on your desktop, in the cloud or on a external harddrive. I have a couple of indie games on steam currently and that fits fine on that tiny SSD. I also used to play Gamecube games in an emulator on it for a while which worked surprisingly well (dipped from 30fps every now and then, but very rarely below 22-23), and that's on a laptop i bought for freaking $250!	zenolijo	t1_dgpww68

t3_66uuvy	t1_dgsj4f3	1493240239	Honestly how many people try to unlock your phone? No ones ever tried to unlock mine.  How many thieves know their victim and have access to a picture of their victim that clearly shows the face in a neutral pose(or whatever pose unlocks it)? If someone steals my phone they're most likely gonna factory reset it and take out the sim.  If it's someone who wants to steal my data or info and wants to use my picture then it's prob someone who knows me and has targeted me in which case I need to keep better company.  I'm willing to risk that slim eventuality to be able to just unlock my phone by looking at it which will happen about 50 times a day!	kaizoku7	t3_66uuvy

t3_64i4r1	t1_dgubfn8	1493331023	Ok, first of all, that is a LOT OF MONEY, even too much for things that you have written. Unless you want to play AAA games, you do not need that. What kind machine do you have right now (maybe you just need system reinstall to solve your problems and save you money)? Do you might consider standard PC? As for you question, yes, you get faulty one, and you can consider between Razer Blade Stealth or HP Spectre 13. Do not worry about smaller SSD or lack of HDD, on those laptops you usually have empty slot for another one, and it is easy to swap (and quite cheaper).	nebojssha	t1_dgu4rsi

t3_66uuvy	t1_dh2q6eq	1493821218	big problem with the fingerprint scanner is that if you hold your phone in a way that triggers your scanner without reading your print, you can lock yourself out for up to 60 mins. I was locked out for 10 mins yesterday when someone started talking to me as I took out my phone.   Doesn't seem to be a way to turn this feature off and it's easier to do than you'd think.	aupsymonkee	t3_66uuvy
t3_64i4r1	t1_dh9622q	1494186047	Hey. I have 2 questions.  Since mother's day and father's day are on the horizons I'm planning to buy a few gadgets for my folks.   1) Chromebook  Is it a good idea to get my mom a Chromebook? She's started her own online business so she might need a good laptop but I can't afford to splurge a lot since I've already spent a shit tonne on mine and I'm in debt already. Her requirements will be basic, running a facebook page, using canva for social media posts which I'll teach her. What laptop would be best for her? My budget is $300-350 for a machine that's basic use is just gonna be using the internet, not a lot of heavy softwares.   2) Smartphone  My dad's smartphone is giving him problems. He has a huwaei Honor 4 or 3. I don't remember which one I gave him 3 years ago. I was thinking of getting the Huawei honor 8 lite for him since he uses his phone for basic stuff too. Internet, calls, facebook, stuff. Would Honor 8 be a better call or Honor 8 lite?   Thanks in advance!	Idiosyncraticity	t3_64i4r1
t3_66a70i	t1_dhcoz2j	1494373648	Everyone keeps saying that this is a cheap alternative method where you get access to way more games but wasn't the whole idea behind why people went crazy for it is that it is a NOVELTY item?
