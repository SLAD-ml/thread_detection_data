t3_4lqgn5	t1_d3r6zrf	1464745307	What would you possibly need from Google while you are driving that Siri couldn't handle just as well? It's not as if the Google app lets you do text messages and phone calls anyway.  I mean, it would be one thing if you were using Android and Google was how you were able to access all of your phone's functions. But for specifically in car use, you might as well just use Siri.	codemonkey85	t1_d3r10yv

t3_4lxffz	t1_d3rcskp	1464755387	They really need to fix up the code behind those double width status bars (for hotspots and phone calls). It's been really buggy in general for the last few releases.  Also - on the subject of hotspots - it really irritates me that for some reason, the "go back" link doesn't appear when tapping the hotspot bar.	swanny246	t1_d3raswx

t3_4lqgn5	t1_d3rcvun	1464755571	Voice recognition for one thing, the general consensus seems to be that Google Now works a lot better than Siri, and I agree personally (for the record - I'm Australian).	swanny246	t1_d3r6zrf
t3_4lqgn5	t1_d3rcxwr	1464755691	For example: I work in the film industry. I'm in a plane 4-6 times a month.   If I receive an email from a producer with flight details, it's automatically entered into my calendar, a card is made, and Now let's me know when it's time to leave for the airport depending on traffic. Siri does none of that.   If I park my car, and at the end of the night am looking for it, Google Now knows where I parked my car cause my Blue tooth disconnected from the car at a certain location.   Automatically.     Siri in my experience does none of this.  Google now is a personal assistant.   Siri is a shitty summer intern.	TCivan	t1_d3r8aj5
t3_4ly1aw	t1_d3rd4mu	1464756079	They're gonna be hard to use piled one top of each other like that. I recommend a setup that's more spread out, with the screens facing you.	skilless	t3_4ly1aw
t3_4lz2vr	t1_d3rd8sg	1464756327	When you restored it and connected it to wifi, are you on the home screen or are you locked to the screen asking for the Apple ID and password during setup?  If you're looking at the home screen, they weren't signed into find my iphone and the phone is as untraceable as if it were factory fresh. If it's activation locked, there's hope. Leave it connected to wifi for a few days and hopefully the other person set it to email them when it came back online.  If they don't put a message on the screen or it's not on find my iphone, turn it in to the police. Even an Apple store won't be able to do anything with it, they'll refer to the police.

t3_4lqgn5	t1_d3rh6f9	1464766855	Bluetooth wouldn't do it, range is too short. But using the phones GPS it could mark where you parked and put a star there.

t3_4lxffz	t1_d3rjatp	1464774575	This has happened a couple times on my 6s Plus. The best thing you can do is 'refresh' (not respring) the springboard.

t3_4lqgn5	t1_d3rl6t8	1464780544	I agree that Google has better voice recognition. However, I think the original confusion stemmed from the fact that this is a thread about Google Now, not Google voice actions or voice search.

t3_4m0unq	t1_d3rn0ka	1464784792	I don't see the reason why download a separate Google App for search, when you can use Safari or any browser you use personally and just type Google and search there. By downloading this App all I noticed is you need to give it full access so Google can trace everything you do in your phone and constantly using your GPS to bombard you with Notifications every time it finds an Event, package, or whenever you have to go somewhere it already knows and will be telling you whenever you have to leave, ect. which makes your battery life less durable and if you don't give it full access you're just using the Google Search alone which is what you'll use inside the browser. So, either you'll give Google full access of your life by downloading this App or you'll have a simple Google Search App sitting there. Just my personal opinion, anyone is free to disagree.	Mystic_Decay	t3_4m0unq
t3_4m0unq	t1_d3rn5h1	1464785073	I use the Google app for Google Now. So package tracking, scores and some misc news stuff that may or may not be relevant to me. It's fairly useful for some purposes!	aumkarpraja	t1_d3rn0ka

t3_4ly9rq	t1_d3rnpij	1464786152	Unless I'm mistaken, even if you turn your phone all the way off, plugging it into a charger will automatically turn it back on.  Can you then shut it off while it's charging?  I didn't think you could.	montydad5000	t1_d3rlxro

t3_4ly9rq	t1_d3rspsm	1464793942	Why not? I thought Low Power Mode worked by reducing the amount of background tasks, such as checking for email, in order to save battery.

t3_4ly9rq	t1_d3ruxsd	1464796916	I guess.

t3_4lyz26	t1_d3rvugt	1464798120	I'd like to know as well. I've purchased a few iPhone 5C models for family, and Apple's silicone case for those (with the ugly circle cutouts) seems to fall apart easily. Any scratch to the silicone can result in what seems like its outer "skin" to tear and peel off.  I have an Apple silicone case for my iPhone 6S, but after having grip issues with it I quickly replaced it, so I don't know how well it holds up.	BitingChaos	t3_4lyz26

t3_4m1n2n	t1_d3rxqq7	1464800598	Sounds like you all need Springer.    But seriously, why is it so hard to get separate Apple IDs and then set up a family with them - at least then only the APPS can be shared, rather than everything else.  This is just funny.  A comedy of errors.	deckyon	t3_4m1n2n
t3_4m1n2n	t1_d3rxvk7	1464800774	Hi, I also had this problem recently, like said before it isn't a bug but you can solve it easily: go to Settings/Messages/Send and receive, there you'll be surprised to see which option is checked ;) Just chose on each phone the respective phone number only and the cross calls/messages will end.	manuyzmani	t3_4m1n2n

t3_4m1n2n	t1_d3s7vye	1464813694	I don't view it as holding it wrong. Why add a second or third apple id? It's just another account to maintain and password to remember. We've had iPhones for many years and this has never been a problem until now. So yes, bug.	StNic54	t1_d3ruwig

t3_4m2n8p	t1_d3s9nqm	1464816071	That's because the Apple photo cloud never really lets you delete images from your phone. It offers to let you store a compressed copy, but if you want to keep a photo in the cloud, it will forever be on your phone. And if you delete it on any device, it's gone forever. We found this out when my wife's phone started bitching about the 8GB of photos she'd accumulated.  Fun fact: the only way to turn off iCloud Photos is to take one of two choices:  * Delete every photo on your phone forever. * Download every photo from the cloud. Which won't work, because you don't have the capacity.  So do yourself a favor: don't use iCloud photos, get Google Photos or Dropbox, and get in the habit of manually deleting old pictures eventually. Google Photos has a handy "delete anything older than 30 days" feature.  "Camera Roll" is slightly better. It's a rolling list of the last 1,000 photos you took, and it was a way to sync photos between devices before iCloud photos. It's still a little wonky, like, you have to be really careful if you want a photo just on your phone and not in photo stream. And deleting sometimes doesn't do what you expect.

t3_4m1n2n	t1_d3s9t73	1464816279	Apple ID's are fine to share. iCloud accounts are not recommended at all.  Apple ID is what stores your App Store history essentially, iCloud is what takes care of the messaging, calling, etc.	llDemonll	t1_d3s7vye

Holding your thumb (not pressing, just touching) on the fingerprint sensor while doing this makes it all go by in a flash, since you'll authenticate as soon as it turns on.

t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3sqenq	1464843057	Yeah but that would require more touches of the screen to get to those options. With this feature OP has posted, it takes more work and you can see fewer apps than if you were to open the folder.	mitch_is_here	t1_d3sq9j8

t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3sqlmh	1464843493	Yes. This is exactly why the implementation of 3D Touch is mostly worthless. Almost every example of a 3D Touch on an app followed by a tap on a menu, performs a task that can be done with a tap on the app followed by a tap within the app. However, things like app settings that could be accessed through a 3D Touch, these things remain buried multiple taps deep in submenu in the settings app. There is so much efficiency and utility that Apple could have given 3D Touch, and what they did is not at all creative or particularly useful.  If I could 3D Touch an app and change notifications and permissions, that would actually be useful, and that would also follow a similar paradigm across all apps. Right now if I 3D Touch an app, I either get nothing or I get an unpredictable list of actions that would have been present immediately if I just opened the app.	null_value	t1_d3sq9j8

t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3squo4	1464844064	There is a lot of room to be had for uses, but as it is I already use it a lot. Peeking inside apps is hugely useful especially for links and images when I don't want to lose my place (Facebook, Twitter, Narwhal, etc)	Liamrc	t1_d3sqlmh
t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3sr6w9	1464844857	I'd love to find it useful. I've tried. I press in things in apps all the time like an idiot and it either does nothing or it does something pointless. Like in Twitter, I can't figure out why I would use it ever. Someone tweets something that is a video and I 3D Touch it, it doesn't play, it just slightly magnifies and I can see half of the first comment, and if I drag I can't scroll to see the comments it just drags up and gives me like an option to share... I had a share button an entire step earlier. All I expected was that the video might play, instead I got options to do all the things that I could have done with one tap.  Can you give an example of an app that uses this to good effect? I've only had bad unpredictable or time wasting experiences.	null_value	t1_d3squo4
t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3srb3v	1464845138	I personally love it on News and Mail the most.  In News, I use it to save a story and to just get a preview of what is actually said in the article (sometimes). Mail is also really just useful for previewing email but instead of having to open the email and then hit the top left to go back you can just tap anywhere on the screen.  Messages too maybe if people texted me more because it can give a smart pre-loaded reply.	ssk42	t1_d3sr6w9
t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3sro32	1464846036	Even if it's no more efficient than actually entering the folder, I support this because of the simple fact that it eliminates the long press jiggle that often happens when you 3D Touch a folder.  That has happened to me so many times, where I've accidentally 3D Touched a folder, and since it doesn't have any 3D Touch functionality, it gets interpreted as a long press, which results in iOS going into edit mode, where the icons all start jiggling to indicate that you can move or delete them.  If you give folders a 3D Touch function - *anything* - it will eliminate this, which would be great.	heyyoudvd	t3_4m5ad5
t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3sromu	1464846077	That's exactly what folders do. I highly doubt you'll see apple put time into a feature like this that provides little benefit and competes with the current model.	NotRenton	t1_d3sqtdq
t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3srrmt	1464846288	I think your idea of allowing every app at a minimum to have access to its settings through 3D touch should be added, and would be a good example to other developers what can be done with it. Maybe it needs finer controls, like how OS X's trackpad gestures can do different things, to take off.	macplayer	t1_d3sqlmh
t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3ss3kw	1464847132	I think a lot of it is psychological too. It *appears* faster/easier/simpler and therefore it is.

t3_4m60ws	t1_d3swczq	1464860832	I just upgraded from an iPhone 5s (64GB) that I had since it came out in Sept 2013 to a iPhone SE (64GB). For $250 you are going to get far better battery life on the SE, a noticeable boost in speed (2X the CPU and 3X the GPU performance, plus double the RAM), a better rear facing camera, Apple Pay (which may or may not matter to you).  The SE will also have a longer life as far as updates are concerned as the iPhone 5s will be 3 years old this September.  So I guess it depends on how long you planned on keeping the phone.  The iPhone 5s is still a very nice phone, the only issue I had with it was the battery life.   That being said, if you are looking to save money, you can certainly do all the same things (except Apple Pay) on the 5s that you can do on the SE.	Dark_Fiber	t3_4m60ws

Plus, other apps have shortcuts that are several menus deep in the app itself.

t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3t5ouy	1464880042	Well no shit every feature isn't going to be WAY faster. If you have two pages in a folder though this will definitely technically be faster. And it's smooth and nice and makes sense so I don't see the issue.   If you've used 3D Touch since the 6S came out its pretty damn intuitive and quicker than lifting up and tapping again. Our phones are so powerful and sick now features are gonna have diminishing  returns lol. Small things like this are gonna be commonplace till our phones have lasers and shit.	lanetrain7	t1_d3t5jru

It depends on where the icon is relative to the rest of the screen.  See my examples below using the Apple Music app in a stock iPhone 6s running regular old iOS 9.3.2.

t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3t6g0c	1464881074	If you have two pages in a folder, then yes this might have an extremely minuscule time advantage. But regardless, I guess it comes down to personal preference and how much you enjoy using 3D touch for *everything*. I'm totally for giving users more options/features than you might think is necessary, because in the end, that is somebody's phone and they want to use it exactly the way they want to.

t3_4m60ws	t1_d3tazmn	1464887105	Like the others mentioned, it depends on what you plan on doing with the phone. If you're a heavy gamer, then it would make sense to get the SE.

With improved internals, the SE is going to be a good phone for much longer than the 5s, which is getting towards the end of it's life cycle.   $250 is a significant amount, but if you plan to keep the phone for more than 2 years, I'd say spend the extra money and get the SE. Less than 2 years, it's up to you. Just one year or so, get the 5s.	AthleticNerd_	t3_4m60ws
t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3tcr4d	1464889378	What.   The animation runs for a fixed time regardless of the device it is running on.	Captain_Alaska	t1_d3t5ka8
t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3tcuki	1464889500	I tend to agree. Using 3d touch is only useful if it is an actual _shortcut_. If it takes the same number of taps, I don't really see the point.	nickerbocker007	t1_d3spgw4

t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3tcvxl	1464889546	Haha. Guess you haven't used an iPhone 4S or 5 lately. Maybe it's *programmed* for a fixed time, but lag is real. That's what I was getting at. A 6S or 6S Plus are the only models that support 3D touch, and there is zero lag on those phones, so the animation should be near instant.	enz1ey	t1_d3tcr4d

t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3tehvt	1464891605	I mean. The animations are stupid long. But honestly it's more about using a feature thats there. Nobody will ever see it if they don't want to use it.	talones	t1_d3t5q3f

t3_4m8vqx	t1_d3tle8b	1464900476	My battery life is quite fine, but only because I pulled the brightness of it down quite a bit...I noticed after updating that at its brightest it was even BRIGHTER than before to a blinding level, and that was what was draining my battery, try putting it down to about 20-25% brightness and see if that helps any?

t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3tlvic	1464901110	Most people have a lot of apps and don't remember which folder they're in. Peek and pop would be incredibly useful for this.	Greenman851	t1_d3teurx
t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3tmdta	1464901828	Yes, but the animations run for a fixed length on the 5S, 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, SE, or any iPad after the Air.  It's got a fixed minimum time, not a fixed max time.  &gt;6S Plus  &gt;  there is zero lag  You've clearly never used either of the Plus models.  &gt;  so the animation should be near instant.  It's not, I actually have the device in question.  That's literally why the tweak 'SpeedIntensifier'exists, to make the animations actually near instant.  [Take a look at this video with all 13 currently existing iPhones doing various things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xao2lK13t78) and you will very clearly see when it comes to things like the unlocking (near the beginning) or app opening animations (3:42) there's no difference.  You'd be surprised to learn that a bone stock (nothing installed) iPhone 5 has comparable animations speeds to a 6S Plus, I have both devices sitting in front of me (That'll change as soon as you start loading it up, but it's fine stock).

t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3tnzq9	1464904110	Can someone explain to me why people are doing back flips over this? It's basically a folder with apps listed vertically. Plus using 3d touch is more complicated in this situation than just using normal touch because you have to drag your finger with pressure instead of just a simple touch.	Udonedidit	t3_4m5ad5
t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3toa5k	1464904540	It's actually more work to press then drag your finger to the app you want than just 2 simple touches.	Udonedidit	t1_d3tkove
t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3todli	1464904682	Totally agree. Press and drag is more work. 2 touches is much easier.	Udonedidit	t1_d3tcnke
t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3tom7k	1464905034	Yeah, 3d touch is almost always more work. The problem is not enough apps have adopted it for it to be useful at this point. And I also always have to adjust how hard I'm pushing before I can get the 3d touch to register.  I doubt humanity has saved any time from 3d touch so far. Maybe in the future it will be more useful. The more inputs the better.	rollerboogie	t1_d3toa5k

t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3traxn	1464909200	The same thing you would do if you want to move an app that has 3D Touch functionality - tap and hold it.  Long pressing while avoiding a 3D Touch is a lot easier than 3D Touching while avoiding a long press.	heyyoudvd	t1_d3tkms2

t3_4ma42a	t1_d3tt9s1	1464912411	Having a device that I can easily manage emails, contacts, and photos is amazing.   I I'm in my mid 30's and use my iPhone for work and personal use, and just 9 years ago I had a "smart" phone (HTC Tilt) that I could use to check work email through the Internet browser, check personal email, but it took forever, and wasn't "push" email and it was hard to keep contacts on it beyond just a name and phone number. I had a Rolodex of business cards and I took pictures with a point and shoot digital camera. Most of my electronic calendar was advanced when I got a Blackberry in 2009. But this was only for work email/calendar/contacts. It took terrible pictures, and the Internet wasn't that functional on it.   The iPhone (along with what would become iCloud) became the center of my personal (and business in 2011) world for phone calls, email, text, calendar, pictures, contacts, Internet access, maps/directions, podcasts/music, etc. What was a cell phone, computer, paper desk calendar, rolodex, Thomas Guide, and iPod is now one thing that also has dozens of other functions (games!). And all in under a decade.   There you go.	EngineerinLA	t3_4ma42a
t3_4ma6ku	t1_d3ttna9	1464913028	I had the same problem. For me, the photos app wasn't actually deleting photos, yet wasn't displaying them. Check the size of your photos app and make sure it's aligned with how many photos you have.	BankNasty	t3_4ma6ku
t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3tukee	1464914534	I ca,e from using a 6 Plus. There were some issues early on in iOS 9, but they were fixed in later updates. After that, like I said, zero lag. No idea why you're experiencing any.   Minimum fixed time, huh? Well no shit, I'm saying the max time could vary based on age and specs of the phone since, you know, it's not a fixed maximum time.   And I know jailbreak tweaks exist to make animations faster, faster than the minimum is still faster. What I originally said wasn't that the animation's programmed time was "long" at all, it was that the folder animation can't possibly be much slower, if at all, than the 3D Touch action and animation in this tweak. Apparently you misunderstood that.	enz1ey	t1_d3tmdta

What you need to do is purchase the app via iTunes on your PC, and then browse to it on your phone and click download - it'll tell you that the current version is unsupported, but asks if you want to download the last working version.

t3_4m8vqx	t1_d3ujd6w	1464966763	Yes, I'm running 9.3.2 on 6S, and I have noticed the same. I also noticed that when you drain it on purpose down to complete dead battery, mine got stuck on 1% and I was heavily using the phone for about another 1.5 hours on 1%, and then finally it shut down. I played nothing but youtube videos on wifi while it was on 1% for 1.5 hours before it shut down.  I think there might be a battery misinformation of actual charge percentage somewhere. Anybody else tried this?	Reddit_Is_Addictive	t3_4m8vqx

Specifically iPhone making my life easier, my closest friends have them and I don't have to explain that an app or the OS is different and can't do the same thing/does more than theirs.  iPhone also makes things more difficult.  On Windows Phone or Android I can touch the NFC to my Bluetooth speaker and it will turn on Bluetooth and connect to the speaker. Apple are jerks and won't enable NFC for anything but their money slimmer, I mean payment platform.	DracheMitch	t3_4ma42a

t3_4ma42a	t1_d3ukbvy	1464968025	It is rather bizarre for an engineer to compare old technology to current technology as though they're equal.  Apple had iTunes on the Motorola ROKR. It was garbage. So should we act like iTunes is permanently garbage on phones?  The iPhone was revolutionary for just two reasons: it was the first smartphone marketed directly to consumers and not business users, and it had a web browser that supported (mostly) full HTML.  Apple deserves all the success it has had because of the iPod and iPhone, but a pat on the back is quite different than the fellatio you're giving them for just slightly iterating Microsoft, Palm and Nokia's work.	DracheMitch	t1_d3tt9s1
t3_4ma42a	t1_d3ukg11	1464968175	So you're saying iPhone was just your first smartphone.  It's too bad you waited so long to get a smartphone.  I had smartphones for a little over a decade before the iPhone came out.	DracheMitch	t1_d3tt4uw

t3_4mdkj6	t1_d3umgw1	1464970821	Sounds like someone may have used your phone and downloaded an app using their own Apple ID. But normally just hitting cancel once is enough to just skip redownloading apps that were installed using that Apple ID.   In the settings, check Phone, Messages, FaceTime, iTunes and App Store and sign out of or remove the other Apple ID wherever you see it.	5kPercentSure	t3_4mdkj6
t3_4mdkj6	t1_d3umru2	1464971222	Unfortunately a no go.  I do not even know anyone remotely close to the email that is coming  up.  I do not see it anywhere in settings either.  I know if I reset the phone i'll be fine, but I am not in a position where I can lose the data in my backup.  I may have to deal with it :(  I appreciate your help though.	Lukaze	t1_d3umgw1
t3_4mdkj6	t1_d3umzw9	1464971512	Before restoring or erasing the phone, try "Reset All Settings" in Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset. It won't erase any data but you'll have to reconfigure all your settings.	5kPercentSure	t1_d3umru2
t3_4mdkj6	t1_d3un550	1464971702	Good idea - i'll do that :)  I was able to cancel the restore, once I found where it was.  I did that and doing a new icloud backup now.  I'll restore that once done and see if I get the same issue.	Lukaze	t1_d3umzw9

t3_4mdkj6	t1_d3uojtn	1464973507	Is your iTunes on a Mac or PC? I have had this issue in the past. It is more common on a PC.   I sold an iPhone that I bought first run, one owner. I unlocked the iPhone and sold it. After I sold it the buyer tripped out and said there was another Apple ID associated with the iPhone. IMPOSSIBLE. Either way he was on a PC. And it was resolved by a reset which. Was strange since the iPhone was brand new and never out of my possession. Ever.	perry1023	t3_4mdkj6

t3_4ma6ku	t1_d3uwcmb	1464983661	I don't have Gmail installed, but maybe I'll look into clearing my native mail app. However, Safari says that it's only using 72 MB of data. And the thing here is that, I've seen the "huge folder" sizes of some of my apps, mainly messages and music, and it just doesn't add up. The fact that you were able to see the large file size is normal and probably how it should be. I'm guessing there is a cache or something that just isn't showing up in the storage view. Thanks for the tip though!	Jimstein	t1_d3ui8uv
t3_4ma6ku	t1_d3uwgk4	1464983807	So what you're saying is, I would need to use my phone from scratch, without restoring from back up after wiping, in order for those caches to really be gone? When I have looked at the backup folders on my computer, there are three subfolders and the total file size adds up to around 9 gigs, which is still less than my 11ish gigs of "used" memory. The three subfolders could be three separate backups though.	Jimstein	t1_d3u8s6k

t3_4mi6lp	t1_d3vogii	1465045817	&gt; I do take a lot of pictures though, is the 16gb sufficient? (Where I live the 32gb is 200 euros extra, so that's *not* an option.)  You might get away with that if you're willing to pay a monthly fee for more iCloud storage, and then use iCloud Photo Library, which stores the master copies of your photos on iCloud, and downloads low-res versions suitable for your screen size to your phone. But I'd suggest holding off and saving some money for more storage if at all possible   &gt; How does the music transfer work? Do I need to use iTunes or is there a way around that?  There are lots of 3rd party apps which have a variety of different ways of getting music onto your phone. iTunes is required for moving music from your computer to the built-in Music app, but I think only a minority of people would still do it that way   &gt; How is the picture quality? Right now I have Samsung Galaxy s4 mini and I'd like a phone with at least just as good camera as this one has.  The camera is excellent, but I've never used the Galaxy so I can't compare.  &gt; Does the phone have issues after being used for a while, e.g. is slower, battery life has decreased,overheating etc? Every Android phone I've had had this issue, which is why I'm thinking of switching.  It will slow down if you update to the latest version of iOS every time it gets updated. If you read this forum, you'll find that for each major update, many people will report whether it slows the device down or not. But you can expect at least 2 or 3 years of updates with minimal if any slowdown   &gt; I know it is not possible to uninstall the preinstalled apps, to which extent does this cause issues? How much of the memory do they take?  There's no way of knowing how much memory they each take. Most people just hide them away in a folder and ignore them   &gt; If there are any former Android users here, was it difficult to get used to the operating system? I do like the ability to personalise the phone, but I don't do it to the extent of installing mods or rooting the phone, I pretty much just use the weather and music widgets and change the background.  Can't help you with that since I've always used iOS.	LondonPilot	t3_4mi6lp

So I got her the 64gb and no more problems and she can take as many pics as she wants.   The rumor is for the iPhone 7 they will finally get rid of 16gb and go 32. We'll see	dblake15	t3_4mi6lp

t3_4mi6lp	t1_d3vq7xm	1465049992	I take a lot of pictures as well and 16GB is not an issue for me as I have Google Photos app installed. When you take a picture it sends it off into google's cloud (unlimited storage is provided) and there is an option within the app to delete the photos from you phone which are synced to google photos. So every week or so I do that and clean up my phones storage. The app is better than the iPhone "Photos" app and allows grouping, searching, sharing, etc. just as well if not better than the native app.	jdr30	t3_4mi6lp

Either way, I love how it looks, it's a great throwback to when Apple was really cool (or cooler, if you like). I mean, I've always been a PC/Windows/Android guy, so I'm not **as** big a fan of them as others... never really disliked them, just thought they were a lot cooler when I was a kid (1980s), for some reason. So that's the reasoning behind the design.	dragontology	t3_4mez5n

I use Google Photos to store my pictures in the cloud for free (they let you store unlimited photos if under 15mb per picture). I also have unlimited data so it's not a big deal for me.   I also use an app called Battery Doctor that clean anything that's been cached.  I find when I stream music it caches information but I run battery doctor every couple days and I'm good.

t3_4mi6lp	t1_d3vua68	1465057642	My experience with the iPhone 6 after having used only Android:  * Camera quality is excellent - better than all but the flagship phablets on Android. I haven't run into overheating issues, but I didn't on my Z3C either other than extended video recording, which I haven't yet tried on the iPhone.  * Anything that uses GPS like fitness trackers seems to use a lot less battery life than it does on Android, which is really nice.  * The reddit apps available for iOS are terrible compared to Android. That's actually a plus for me, since it means I waste less time on reddit when I should be doing other things.  * I still have a *lot* of trouble getting used to the OS. It's not hard to use exactly, but it's a lot messier than the modern (5.x+) Android UI, and I find I need to be far more precise in my taps and gestures on iOS.  * Notifications work differently on iOS - this may or may not be an issue for you depending on your preferences. Personally I don't like it, as it's much easier for me to accidentally miss notifications.  * Battery life is actually lower than my Sony Z3C was overall, but it's more consistent if that makes sense. My Z3C lasts longer in idle and basic activity, the iPhone lasts somewhat longer when using things like GPS or camera. Admittedly, the Z3C has unusually high battery life for Android.  * I have the 64GB model, so I can't really speak to storage. I highly recommend using something to upload the photos so you don't need to keep them on the device, such as Dropbox or Google Photos, both of which offer more free storage (especially Google) than iCloud.	noratat	t3_4mi6lp
t3_4mdkj6	t1_d3vuyns	1465058803	There's a few different ways that this can happen. The most common that I have seen are:   1. folks downloading music or videos that originally came from iTunes but were from someone else's account, like a friends does it for you. A friend sharing an app by signing out of your account signing into their account, downloading it would also do this. This can also include downloading torrent files that have someone else's Apple ID tag on them as the original purchaser.   2. Syncing your phone to a computer that is not yours. This can also simply include plugging in your phone to someone else's computer to charge it or someone else plugging their phone into yours. If iTunes is up it often goes into sink mode as soon as it detects the device. More often than not this kind of Apple ID "infection" happened a while ago which is why you don't remember the email address and was on iOS prior to the whole forced trust/do you want to connect pop up so we have now. This can even include having it happen at your carrier. At one point in time it was not uncommon for carrier shops to have a laptop and do the service of backing up old phones and restoring them to newly purchased phones for customers. This meant that dozens of Apple IDs could get transmitted back-and-forth through the various phones as people were having their information put on the laptop even if the back up was actually removed.

t3_4m5ad5	t1_d3vv4c9	1465059069	I'm not sure who you asked to say that this is a "most wanted feature".

t3_4mi6lp	t1_d3vwi9h	1465061435	I've made the same change and heres my 2 cents:  * I have a 16GB model because I store everything on the cloud, google play music, google drive, icloud etc, so I always have about 6GB free space. I stream all my media with unlimited data and I don't have any games installed.  * I transfer my music with Google Play Music because I have to pay to use apples wireless music sync service. Google gives me 50,000 songs for free and its as painless as uploading it on my computer and having it available everywhere.  * I used to have a Z5 Compact, which took multiple 20MP photos and sampled them into a single 8MP photo. I think the iPhone 5s took photos onpar with the Z5 compact.  * I haven't had the 5s that long but a friend I know has had it for a year and it is still running as quick as it always did. iOS is very well optimised for older devices.  * The phone doesn't give me too much data but I think the preinstalled apps take up less than 50MB, its hardly anything.  * It's very easy to get used to the operating system from Android. It's similar in the aspect that you can swipe left on the home screen to get contextual info like current news and weather. Swiping from the top gives you notifications, but unlike android to get quick settings you swipe from the bottom.	brucensb	t3_4mi6lp

t3_4mjcn8	t1_d3vycud	1465064662	The "Time to home" notification is a feature of iOS 9. It's figured out which Bluetooth device is the handsfree in your car, so when your phone connects to your car's Bluetooth it suggests driving directions to where it thinks you want to go.  I've only seen it pop up for my home and work, but if I had a regular routine of driving anywhere else it might work for those too.  As for why it only just started happening, perhaps your phone hadn't figured out your home address or which Bluetooth device was in your car until now. It took my phone a couple of weeks after installing iOS 9 for it to start working.	molepigeon	t3_4mjcn8

t3_4mmyd6	t1_d3wqekv	1465127021	1. Calm down.  2. The reason why this is happening is because iTunes doesn't have any way of knowing that this is the same computer you've always had — the entire computer was erased as set up as a "new" computer, and so iTunes — along with any other software on your computer — is going to believe this is an entirely new PC. It's not a fault of iTunes, it's just the way of things.  When you go to sync your music, you'll get that dreaded message that your iPhone's content will have to be erased and replaced with content on your "new" iTunes library. Rest assured that the only content that gets erased is your music, so no worries about losing any other information on your iPhone.  As long as all the music that is on your iPhone is also in your iTunes library, then you shouldn't be losing anything then, right? While it might take a little time for it to remove everything / re-add it, it'll work and you'll be back up and running in no time.  3. Calm down.	cocobandicoot	t3_4mmyd6

This is my first time owning an iPhone, and while I'm absolutely loving it, I've always been wary of the iOS ecosystem that many say is 'boxed in'.   At least it's only the music that's getting deleted!	EzzoMahfouz	t1_d3wqekv
t3_4mmyd6	t1_d3wqo80	1465127927	&gt; I've always been wary of the iOS ecosystem that many say is 'boxed in'.   I can definitely understand some of your concerns. For the most part, you won't often run into issues with the "closed" ecosystem that iOS has — in fact, there can be many benefits to it, especially when it comes to being integrated with other Apple devices.  That being said, the issue you experienced is certainly an annoying one. It's a holdover from many years ago (back when the iPod first came out). Although they don't really say why they have this system in place, the real reason is because, back when the iPod first came out, Apple had to play nice with all the big music companies / record labels at a time when piracy was a very big deal to them. As a result, Apple put this system in place so that if you had an iPod, you couldn't just stick all your music on it, and then run to a friends' house and share all your thousands of songs onto their computer, and then their songs with yours, and so and so forth.  So that's why when your computer saw that you iPhone was connected to "another" computer's iTunes library, it freaked out and said no. Rest assured that it's something you don't see much anymore, but as long as you still have all that same music in iTunes, you won't be heavily affected by it.  Also, glad you're liking the iPhone so far!	cocobandicoot	t1_d3wqhm3

t3_4mgmup	t1_d3wryg7	1465131766	Well, all you need to do is take it in to Apple and don't mention anything about how you think YOU might have broken it. Accidental damage isn't covered under warranty. Just tell them that you noticed it progressively happening and getting worse and worse over the last few days.  They should either replace the screen or give you a new one. Just make sure you do a backup before you take it in lol  Good luck! :)	OfficialLaunch	t1_d3wa5uf

t3_4mluai	t1_d3wuf6d	1465137481	http://imgur.com/zoWVXQq  This is my Saddle Brown that was purchased on release day. 6S+ I do not clean it ever, just normal use from being in my pocket, laying on my desk or riding while in my car. The edges show a lot more wear due to oil from my hands, dirt, etc. Overall it looks nice, I have dropped it a couple of time (it seemed to protect it decently).

t3_4mnpl7	t1_d3wwoqm	1465141632	I've had a similar type of protector with those button things and it was a complete piece of shit. I might've had a dodgy one, so it's purely anecdotal, but it put me off ever trying them again.	Clgrv	t3_4mnpl7

t3_4mnpl7	t1_d3wz3lw	1465145614	I did use one of them. They were so so. It may have been the particular screen that I used, but the buttons would work like 85% of the time. However, the area of the screen that the buttons were supposed to trigger, wouldn't work if I actually tapped it. If I'm not being clear: for example the bottom left corner of the phone would emulate the top left hand corner of the screen. If the bottom left didn't work (that 15% of the time) I would give up and tap the actual top left hand corner of the screen, but for whatever reason that part of my screen was kind of "disabled" or just very unresponsive.   Tl;dr my experience was that it was shoddy at best. It's fun for a while, but if it's not functional it's not a huge deal to live without.	thisxisxlife	t3_4mnpl7
t3_4mluai	t1_d3wziz3	1465146287	Or rather, Saddle Brown is the newer (end of 2015) case, and OP's dark brown is from the 6/6S generation (end of 2014).	kermityfrog	t1_d3wjh5y

The reason is mainly to text the few people with Android devices because most schools have crappy signal inside and we need a way to text over school wifi rather than relying on going outside or something to text.

t3_4mrlo7	t1_d3xu06d	1465200582	Yes there are some confusing powersaving things. What I found out:  -If MacBook is plugged in, you can charge your phone. -If MacBook is not plugged in, you have to open and close the lid after connecting your phone. -If MacBook is under (I think) 50% battery, you have to let the lid open. If you close it, it will stop after some minutes.	Kulimeya	t1_d3xt6hx
t3_4mrlo7	t1_d3xu12o	1465200673	Even when I'm charging the MacBook and plug in my iPhone, it still won't work. It has a tendency of this "stroke" issue: conflicts between charging and not charging. Even if I have 100% it doesn't work properly.   Edit: Tried SMC reset and still no changes.	alonitzhaky	t1_d3xu06d
t3_4mptql	t1_d3xucjf	1465201839	Ah maybe it's popular outside the US. Most people in UK and probably the rest of Europe use WhatsApp. I'd say it's better for group chats and sending media/locations etc.  And yes I have iMessage and an iPhone too.	wickedcriminal	t1_d3xjtl9
t3_4mrlo7	t1_d3xukqt	1465202677	Yep, my iPhone charges when connected to my Air. The same with my daughter's iPad, also charges when connected to the MBA	SlighMD	t3_4mrlo7
t3_4mrlo7	t1_d3xv3jd	1465204621	Mine charges fine as well, lid open and closed, MagSafe connected or disconnected. You should try other devices that draw power from USB to see if the problem is with the laptop or the cable/iPhone. It's probably the Mac, though.	itchy_cat	t3_4mrlo7
t3_4mrlo7	t1_d3xvdpt	1465205689	Have you tried another cable? It sounds like how my cables have gone in the past when they need replaced. I've only ever had the official cable and thats what happens, constant reading / non reading. I can't say much for charging since I rarely do it but if there's an issue with your cable there's a chance its restricting power flow to the phone.	examinati0n	t3_4mrlo7
t3_4mris3	t1_d3xvlqw	1465206509	Man, if there was a way to actually do this, who wouldn't do it? I've never gotten a useful call from a blocked number.	Reas0n	t3_4mris3

t3_4mrlo7	t1_d3xydoj	1465215030	You could try a third party cable, once its MFI Certified. I've never used one but you can get cables that have a reinforced outer layer on them which better prevents damage to the inside.    The initial cost would be greater but I've gone with the thinking that over time the cable makes back the money I'd otherwise spend on the Apple ones.    If you search the sub you could find a post with recommendations. Its just another option to consider.	examinati0n	t1_d3xvq4z

t3_4mrlo7	t1_d3xzuli	1465218267	This exact thing happened to a friend of mine. He bought a new genuine cable and had his Mac checked and it was fine. In the end it was the Lightning port on his phone. One of the 8 pins was broken. The one used to charge via laptop. He could charge no problem from wall outlet. Tried my phone on his Mac with no issues.	derekm323f	t3_4mrlo7

t3_4mris3	t1_d3y261l	1465222375	The thing is is that in this case the number is hidden so it can't be blocked.	GalacticSpaceTiger	t1_d3xx4ix

t3_4mris3	t1_d3y6ew9	1465228509	Yeah, the only issue is that you can't block a specific unknown caller because that same one can't be identified vs other unknown callers. Therefore you could only ever block ALL unknown calls.	GalacticSpaceTiger	t1_d3y5mff

t3_4mwiru	t1_d3z2ne2	1465273974	For some, it looks cool. For others, it's MUCH less stressful on the eyes in dark environments.  To see for yourself check out night mode in Reddit Enhancement Suite, Alien Blue, or Reddit for iOS for example and go in a dark room. It's easier on your eyes than a bright white interface like what iOS has in a lot of places.	SteelFlexInc	t1_d3z2hce
t3_4mwiru	t1_d3z2oz0	1465274059	On iPhones, using the phone at night is almost impossible because of the screen and ios's largely white theme. With a dark mode, the screen puts less strain on your eyes as the main color on the screen is black, not white.	TheDarkKnight436	t1_d3z2hce

t3_4mxoey	t1_d3z7d7k	1465285864	Aviary and VSCO for photo filters, text, and editing. Aviary normally makes you pay for filter and feature packages, but if you grab it right now, you can download ALL of their feature packs for free. That's normally like $100 in downloads, so get it while you can! VSCO is more for professional high end filters, whereas Aviary is for adding text, effects, borders, stickers, and more filters (but different from VSCO). Both programs serve different purposes and work well in tandem with each other.  For alternative keyboards, get Gboard and Word Flow. Gboard is by Google, and includes a feature that lets you access Google directly from the keyboard, making adding links and content into texts and posts incredibly simple. Word Flow is from Microsoft and has two great features. First, it's a swipe keyboard that's very accurate. Second, it features a one-handed mode that can be very useful, especially with a phone like the 6+ or 6S+.	DrTenochtitlan	t3_4mxoey
t3_4mwiru	t1_d3z7u98	1465287477	I feel like an ass when I say this but really?   Come up with something new apple. I've had split screen and dark mode on my note5 (I just skin a night theme), and my much older LG g3.  No one likes to admit this but ios is trying to be Android now. I mean split screen? This is what I should expect from iOS 10?   Instead of the same shit I already have on Android, why not something novel? I mean, they jacked the design from the galaxy s5 with the side mounted power button... Power saving mode just became a thing when it's been a thing on every Android phone I've ever had... Jacked flux and called night mode... Act like they invented long press with the 6s...   The list goes on.  I'm just waiting for something new from apple I haven't seen before in the iOS operating system.	OptionalCookie	t3_4mwiru

t3_4mwiru	t1_d3z8aw2	1465289140	I specifically went for a 6s+ just in hopes of split screen coming eventually. I figured if it was going to appear on iPhone, it would be on the + series.	Lordmorgoth666	t1_d3z5ugv

[June 2016 Homescreen](https://imgur.com/rjXM5BG)   I've been finding the following particularly useful: - BillGuard for checking on fraudulent transactions and tracking my spending - Having a four-folder system across the bottom ("Local" is really handy as an idea!) - Next screen is all folders and is mainly for occasionally used apps  Still getting used to the untimely death of Sunrise. Tried the in-Outlook implementation for a while, but it doesn't feel right managing my personal life in my work app. Trying to ween myself back onto the default Calendar.	northonm31	t3_4meu4t

t3_4myxnw	t1_d3ze7gc	1465305598	You talking about [this offer](http://www.apple.com/iphone/trade-in/)?  First, it's $13/mo for the SE with a 5c trade-in. Second, it's an 24-month payment plan.  Look on the bottom of the page, it's based on the fact that you're getting $75 for your 5c and applying it toward the purchase of an SE.   $399 (base price of SE) - $75 (your trade-in) = $324  $324 / 24 months = $13.50 (your monthly payment)	guiltydoggy	t3_4myxnw

t3_4mwiru	t1_d3zexgq	1465306811	I was thinking, if this update is going to be a "light" update, what Apple could do to sort of entice people to upgrade anyway.  One of the things I came up with was split-screen  or PiP a la the iPad Air + models.	scatmango	t3_4mwiru
t3_4myxnw	t1_d3zey2s	1465306839	You always get much more selling it yourself and applying that money toward paying for the new phone than trading it in. These trade-in programs always lowball you, it's just the convenience of not having to try to sell it yourself.  I looked on Swappa and it looks like the phone is going for around $100, and more on Craigslist. Also unlock the phone before you sell it, they go for more than carrier locked ones.	Yo_2T	t1_d3zervv

t3_4myxnw	t1_d3zfhoc	1465307719	Yes. I know all carriers have a set of criteria that you have to qualify for before they unlock it for you for free. If you've been using the phone for a long time and it's paid for, it's likely that att will unlock it for you.	Yo_2T	t1_d3zf2m7
t3_4mz38c	t1_d3zfl3q	1465307869	It will work, till you try to update it... the sensor / logic board are tied together.  Edit: i believe it will no longer brick your phone (error 53), but your touch id will not work after you update.	Beezure	t3_4mz38c

t3_4mz38c	t1_d3zhme8	1465310938	It has nothing to do with the display itself, but everything to do with the Touch ID sensor. The sensor is paired to the logic board at assembly, and only Apple has a system to re-pair a new sensor. If you damage the sensor package or the cable in anyway, you don't have Touch ID anymore.	aldrinjtauro	t3_4mz38c

t3_4mz38c	t1_d3zht7u	1465311209	Thanks- but it is all still ambiguous. No solid answers. Surely hundreds of people everyday replace their iPhone 6 screens. I mean they break so darn easily!	ycon	t1_d3zgflr
t3_4myxnw	t1_d3zhvt5	1465311312	Yeah like /u/guiltydoggy said, 75 for the 5C is probably +/- $5, the best you're going to get. If you want the SE can't beat 13.5 a month.	BeryMcCociner	t3_4myxnw
t3_4mz38c	t1_d3zhwbn	1465311332	Touch ID. It may be working now, but you've gotta extract all the components from the display without breaking them. They're slightly adhered to the back of the display assembly.	aldrinjtauro	t1_d3zhr2w

t3_4mwiru	t1_d3zllmz	1465316265	Probably less so, and more down to personal preference.  Occasionally I'll switch Alien Blue from dark to light mode when it's incredibly bright out so it's easier to see with screen glare, but generally I find it more pleasant to read light text on dark backgrounds day or night.	SumoSizeIt	t1_d3zfp25
t3_4mz38c	t1_d3zlyfl	1465316725	Correct. Folks got their panties in such a wad that they couldn't violate the terms by going third party that Apple changed the software so now when it detects a third party sensor it just disables Touch ID.   I love having those conversations when I return phones unrepaired.	Techsupportvictim	t1_d3zfl3q
t3_4mwiru	t1_d3zmm9z	1465317600	I'd love for Apple to have it work like split screen works on Android N. It's very smooth and fluid, and is nice for doing things like playing videos or other media in one pane ([like this ](http://i.imgur.com/1SP2xWK.jpg)), or for copying multiple things from a webpage into a text or note or something. You don't need a huge phone for this to be useful. Split screen is nicer on the iPads due to the bigger screen space for productivity, but it can be very nice even on moderately sized phones like the 6 or 6S.	ZappySnap	t1_d3z5ugv
t3_4mwiru	t1_d3zmwj8	1465317966	It would probably be a horizontal line on the iPhone, like Samsung and the other phones that already have this feature.	crispix24	t1_d3z5zah

I read about this, so what I bought includes the glass, digitiser and LCD  Where I am, Apple charge $220 to replace the glass. Therefore I am literally saying 300% by doing it myself.  I have replaced iPhone screens before (iPhone 3, 4 &amp; 5's) so I'm not sure what you think I know very little.  I simply know very little about the iPhone 6 Touch ID situation- as because (as you can tell) the information about it is very ambiguous.  99.999% chance of bricking the device- seems dramatic.Surely the worst that can happen is my touch ID stop's working?

t3_4mz38c	t1_d409227	1465348107	The thing is, until recently, if you were replacing the screen, you couldn't replace the Touch ID sensor and cable, unless you didn't mind never being able to update or restore. That's not a problem anymore, but you will lose all Touch ID functionality. Most guides work on this assumption.	aldrinjtauro	t1_d408f06

I also need it to work while on data (I've used some before that basically only block ads in Safari and not in other apps, or they only blocked while on wi-fi).

t3_4mxoey	t1_d40n0qk	1465374863	Just a few suggestions to get you started.  If you listen to podcasts, my top two choices are Overcast and Castro. For Reddit, I would go with Narwhal. For news, I mainly stick to Feedly, but if you want one that is not the norm, give Quartz a shot. Parcel is what I use to keep track of deliveries. Tweetbot is my app of choice for Twitter. Finally, for weather, I recommend Yahoo Weather, though Sunshine is an interesting and great-looking take on a weather app.	SlantedPictureFrame	t3_4mxoey
t3_4mwiru	t1_d40t1hw	1465391232	Double and triple that for Tubex. The essential YT app in my opinion.

t3_4n60qx	t1_d4177f9	1465409863	I'll throw in my experience with task managers. I've bounced from Reminders (Apple version), Fantastical, Clear, Things, ToDo, Wunderlist, and Google Keep.   Reminders and Fantastical have been my default for a while now as I liked having my calendar and tasks in one app, and they sync with one another. I stopped using Things despite the high ($19.99) price because I wanted something simple, Clear was the best (only switched to Reminders for Siri), while Wunderlist and Google Keep provided easy syncing between my MacBook, iPad, and iPhone.   The best feature (from reviewing the app in the App Store) is the ease of switching between personal and professional task lists. Looks like a solid app, and provides that nice feature of switching.

However, since Overcast does have a larger feature set, a lot of people prefer Overcast above all else. For me, I just listen to podcasts and that's it, so Castro is perfect for me.

t3_4n771p	t1_d41fqg6	1465420057	Because it's an absolute piece of shit programming. On my 6+, it's constantly lagging when I scroll. Clicking any external link and trying to view a web page in their built-in web browser is a crap shoot: 1/2 the time, the page never loads, and the other half of the time, it crashes while trying to render the page.

t3_4n771p	t1_d41gypv	1465421750	In my opinion, the onus should be on Apple to provide users a way to clear an app's cache on an app-by-app basis. But yeah, the Facebook app has been terrible in general.	codemonkey85	t1_d41ejas
t3_4n771p	t1_d41hb6a	1465422230	I would say the responsibility rests with the developers of the apps in question.	Da-Aaron	t1_d41gypv
t3_4n771p	t1_d41hjlw	1465422556	I might also be a little biased on this, because I was on Android for a while, and that was an OS-level feature there.  Either way, it needs to be a user option, especially for cache-hungry apps such as Facebook.	codemonkey85	t1_d41hb6a

t3_4n771p	t1_d425gga	1465472081	Yeah and another thing: On devices using iOS 5 or later, cache cleaning occurs automatically when the device has less than 1 GB of available storage. This storage-management feature is designed to optimize the performance of your iOS device when space is limited. The cache for infrequently used documents is cleared first.

t3_4n771p	t1_d426ykv	1465475692	With google photos makes sense. It needs to cache for fast loading.  It actually takes up to 2 GB. With Facebook however , should not take this big.	chimichangaXL	t1_d41hr8i
t3_4n60qx	t1_d428bhm	1465478308	Hello! Thanks again for the promo code. After using it for a ~day I have a few comments.  What I like: - The app is quick, responsive and easy to use. - Having multiple lists for different categories like "work" and "personal" and the ability to recolor/rename them - The backburner system is really nice. I love how when you hit the burn button it moves below the other items - We have power over how badge notifications are handled  What I don't like: - You can't have more (or less) than two lists. We should be able to swipe between as many lists as we deem necessary. Right now I have "Work" and "Personal" (as per the default), but what if I wanted "Work" "Family" and "Friends"? Or even 4 like "Personal", "School", "Tasks for building the shed", "Misc."? - Items put on the Backburner from yesterday aren't displayed at the bottom of the list anymore. I don't like this. I want all my items to stay visible (backburner or not) without having to go to to a separate "backburner" list.  Glaring issues: - When you swipe on a task and hit "edit", if you hit "cancel" from there it deletes the entire task. Hitting "cancel" in this situation should simply stop editing the task. - When moving items back and forth from Backburner, the items do not stay in order. Let's say I have 6 tasks named 1 2 3 4 5 and 6. If I burn 1, 2 and 3 in order, they get put in "2 1 3" order below. That makes no sense; they should stay "1 2 3" below. Likewise if I unburn them, it should go back to the original order. Right now it seems like they just randomly pop back in wherever: looking at my previous example, if I unburn 1 2 and 3, my new order becomes 4 3 2 1 5 6. What's with that?  What I would add: - Fixes/improvements for the above issues/comments - Cloud backup (I don't see anything about it in settings so I'm just assuming it doesn't happen)  ... I'll post more if I think of anything else!	Bubo_scandiacus	t3_4n60qx

t3_4nceqj	t1_d43djv4	1465542713	I remember the days of having a phone that could utilize any old 3.5mm to 1.75mm (?) adapter. It felt so cool to be able to use my *real* headphones with my *phone*.	SteppingSplash	t1_d43bea2
t3_4nceqj	t1_d43dpyd	1465543260	I listen to a lot of music on my phone. I have to be able to listen to music if my phone has power, I don't want to be unable to listen to music because my headphones ran out of juice. And also, wireless headphones are expensive and I don't really have that kind of money, especially after spending hundreds on the phone itself.	box-art	t3_4nceqj
t3_4ndyfz	t1_d43e8sj	1465544987	So much this, if you have an Apple Watch it keeps tapping your wrist as well which for me is "annoying" enough that I just do whatever it is ;)	Rosydoodles	t1_d4349mp
t3_4ndyfz	t1_d43eili	1465545947	That's it! Well done.   I had it, and used it extensively, but when Siri was launched it became so much easier to add reminders, so I stopped.	JimmerUK	t1_d433j71
t3_4ndhlw	t1_d43evqf	1465547169	It works, but when I tried it I went to bed with a full battery and woke up with it at 4%. Although now that I think of it, I didn't snooze that day because I knew it would die and not wake me up again.	snakehissken	t1_d43cok3
t3_4nceqj	t1_d43gdpz	1465552763	Well let Apple know and I'm sure they'll cancel their plans when they find out it doesn't work for you.	ClebschGordan	t1_d43dpyd
t3_4ndyfz	t1_d43gdsq	1465552771	Does it also read from the calendar and remind for this, or is it only for reminders created within the app itself? I would really like something exactly like this, except it reads my calendar and helps me make sure I'm not going to be late for or, worse, miss a meeting.	H278	t1_d4349mp
t3_4nceqj	t1_d43gegw	1465552837	You can get decent Bluetooth headphones for under $35 and very good ones for less than $100.   Edit: why would you down vote me for pointing out that Bluetooth headphone prices are much better nowadays?	ClebschGordan	t1_d43aldr
t3_4nceqj	t1_d43gj1o	1465553296	Lots of people have invested good money on headphones that they did a lot of research on. There's nothing wrong with the 3.5mm jack, a lot of people prefer wired over wireless due to quality.	box-art	t1_d43gdpz
t3_4ndyfz	t1_d43hhh8	1465556568	I also use alarmed. It'll nag the shit out of you and there are a number of really annoying tones. Also, it can import from your regular reminders app, so you can set reminders with Siri and then tell her to open the alarmed app and it'll import them.	jakemg	t1_d4348ia
t3_4nceqj	t1_d43hkwy	1465556858	If this was a common feature back in the day that was removed to make room for more of an open standard, the wouldn't going *back* to that same business model be more along the lines of regress?	mattchoo86	t1_d43a0uh

t3_4nceqj	t1_d43iysd	1465560589	The only thing I dislike about losing the headphone jack is the fact that my car doesn't have bluetooth, however I religiously use the jack for my aux cable to still be able to listen to things.	Marino4K	t3_4nceqj
t3_4nceqj	t1_d43jgww	1465561730	I buy headphones for &amp;amp;lt;$10. You can't just presumptuously tell someone "oh they're cheap, merely triple-10x what you're paying now!" That's fucking expensive.   And then they break and you buy another pair. Suddenly it's completely out of control, just for headphones that should be a couple of bucks.   Edit: absurd bipolar down voting which can only be interpreted as class-based shaming. "You can't afford cheaply made yet unnecessarily expensive Bluetooth headphones even though they're a mere several **times** what you're used to paying? DOWNVOTE!!"  Eat a dick.	PangurtheWhite	t1_d43gegw
t3_4nceqj	t1_d43kb2o	1465563451	Neither is trying to innovate by removing the headphone jack. They're simply space. Apple already has lightning port headphones, so the innovation has already happened if you want to call it that.	Dinkdinkdata	t1_d42wd6q
t3_4nceqj	t1_d43kd41	1465563561	For me I don't want to the Bluetooth headphones, however the bigger issue is my car has a 3.5mm jack. No Bluetooth in my factory radio. Now I'm stuck with a dongle and what if I want to charge while listening which I do often? Just another mess of dongles	Dinkdinkdata	t1_d43gegw

t3_4nceqj	t1_d43mt9l	1465567673	You should consider getting a head unit that does bluetooth.  When it's a good implementation, it's so very nice to have.   Hop in the car with phone in pocket, car stereo continues to play whatever you were listening to last automatically, whether it's music/podcast/video/whatever.  Plus you can do hands free calling and such without taking your phone out.  Also you can push a button to invoke Siri.	gerwen	t1_d43iysd
t3_4nceqj	t1_d43n67o	1465568212	An adapter would really just be a crutch to smooth the progressive transition to future technology. When phones inevitability rid themselves of the old technology of the 3.5mm jack and the market shifts toward making USB Type C and/or Bluetooth headphones a standard, an adapter will be less and less necessary. This happens all the time with technology. Many people didn't want to buy new peripherals when PS/2 was phased out in lieu of the USB standard that was better in damn near every way, but it eventually happened, and the transition was definitely for the better. It's human nature to cling to what you love and are used to and sneer at the thought of change. The old quote from Henry Ford always comes to mind: "If I would have asked my customers what they would have preferred, they would have told me that they wanted a faster horse" or something to that extent. I foresee the standard to be Bluetooth headphones that still connect to your phone via USB-C, but have a detachable cable so you can use them wirelessly if you do so choose. The USB-C standard allows charging both ways, so you literally will be able to charge your headphones by plugging them into your phone, and you can listen to them wired without using the battery in the headphones at all.	SteppingSplash	t1_d43hkwy
t3_4nceqj	t1_d43nxdz	1465569326	At some point in the next year, will probably get a newer car with bluetooth built in so trying to not invest in a new unit.	Marino4K	t1_d43mt9l
t3_4nceqj	t1_d43ny0w	1465569352	I'm sure there will be little bluetooth adapters with a headphone jack to accommodate those who can't cut the cord.	technicalityNDBO	t3_4nceqj

t3_4nceqj	t1_d440sm1	1465586623	These days, it's not even worth replacing the head unit. I end up having to spend more in bypass and connection adapters than the head unit often costs. Not only that but now the design of these dashboards makes anything but oem look like shit.  I saw pioneer or alpine had a complete setup for a dvd/navy for my system to rep,ace the oem housing. It was around 2500$ by the time you bought everything. Surprising that the dvd nav unit with all its bells and whistles was the cheapest part of the entire package.	negroiso	t1_d43mt9l
t3_4nceqj	t1_d441e4a	1465587430	Crutchfield.com has an extensive database on what fits in what with and without extra work, and sells the adapters and plastic dash pieces alongside the head units for free or reasonable cost.

t3_4nebdr	t1_d44l4w0	1465620710	No one can answer that question over the Internet. And no Apple isn't forcing you. You are free to not have the phone serviced if they say there is no way a display will work. But if they try it and it fails the old phone will be dead and wiped and not coming back.

t3_4nlzcg	t1_d450gpc	1465663342	My guess is Apple will probably give you around $250 for it by time the 7 comes out. You could sell it on swappa and get another $150 or so. But this is completely based off of previous years. This year has the possibility of being different because the 7 isn't a major refresh. That could lower the demand and make your phone slightly more valuable, but it is a guessing game. In my opinion, you are silly to buy a 6s if you are sure you want the 7. Just go buy a 5s, they are likely to not lose any value when the 7 releases due to the SE being the new budget device.	ralph-ey	t3_4nlzcg
t3_4nlzcg	t1_d4512fz	1465664298	Sell it right before the new phone. Get yourself a cheap ass throwaway for the interim. You'll probably make 90% of the money back if you sell it right before	bythqir	t3_4nlzcg

t3_4nlzcg	t1_d4540ql	1465669018	From a value perspective, you may want to buy a mint condition i5s. That's probably going to lose the least value in that time.  You're going to lose at least $250- 350 in value on a 6s. You pay a $200 premium to get the 128gb, but there's less of a value on higher GB when you sell it or trade it. You'll buy the 6s for $850 and may get $500 when the 7 comes out.	my02	t3_4nlzcg

So far I haven't come across a single utility that claims to delete the media files from iPhone. They all copy stuff into the PC and they're done. I want them to delete it also from the phone.	mugen_is_here	t1_d45ad30

So, instead of doing that, buy a phone that costs the $300 you were potentially going to loose.  Sell that phone for whatever and you still come out on top.   I would get a OnePlus phone or something to play with for the next 3 or 4 months, cheaper and you will loose a lot less.	Lynucs	t3_4nlzcg

t3_4nlzcg	t1_d45zhho	1465741025	Thanks, just trying to convert my wife to an iPhone user. She had a bad experience with the 4s, but I think it was just att overcharging us on the bill and she didn't give herself enough time and learn how to use the iPhone. Plan to get her one later this year for her birthday. Now her Samsung is periodically not taking calls, my 5s is still working like a new phone 🤓	electron_man	t1_d45xg3c

t3_4npxeu	t1_d46rzni	1465783642	Siri is (under my own testing) assuming by "where" you mean a location, it seems like Siri on your end is also not allowed to access Location Services so it can't check Maps for locations nearby that sell "watch."   Siri on my end brings up jewelry stores. So I'm guessing Siri's limited AI is trying to get you to jewelry stores nearby. Obviously it screwed up, but it's also working somewhat correctly.

t3_4nm03h	t1_d474l0e	1465812056	Deleting media from an iPhone is extremely simple  You can do two things:  1) delete the whole app and reinstall it.  2) go manually to each group and individual chat by tapping on group or individual,then tap media manually delete all media content by selecting all.	iApples	t1_d45ijs7
t3_4nm03h	t1_d474tpn	1465812931	Thanks for replying.  Then second step would be very tedious since I have received 1200 video files and a more than 5000 what'sapp photos since the time I started using the device. I don't think it's possible to select that many media files by tapping each one individually.  The first option sounds goods.  However, I noticed another issue with the iPhone content. I copied everything to the PC with the following ways:  1) iTunes 2) Windows explorer "import photos from this device" 3) 3rd party software that helps copy all photos from iPhone to the PC.  In ALL these scenarios iPhone is unable to distinguish between camera pics and whatsapp pics. I'm surprised that such a basic thing has not been taken care of by Apply.  I have currently copied about 7600 photos onto my PC and I'm now faced with the ridiculous task of sorting through them to separate my camera pics and whatsapp pics.  I'm just curious how such a basic functionality doesn't work for iPhone and how come nobody else seems to have brought it up.	mugen_is_here	t1_d474l0e

t3_4nm03h	t1_d486akw	1465869297	Yes I had already seen that page before I posted here. All the answers there are complicated and do half the job.  For example that recovery tool, it creates separate folders for the media content based on chat. So you'll have HTML files created. That's needless and it takes a lot of time.  Plus there's no option to delete these things from the phone. You need to do it manually which means inside the phone selecting about 7000 images and 1200 videos.  I've seen the other solutions. Uploading/Downloading everything from the web. It's just an overkill.	mugen_is_here	t1_d4840ai

t3_4nzd84	t1_d48911d	1465873034	After posting [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/comments/4llhth/i_paid_for_this_app_asshole/) just two weeks ago, I was going to work out and thought I'd stream something to my new Iphone to keep me entertained.  Instead I was greeted with this.  I **paid** for this app.  They switched it to freemium, then crippled it so paying customers like myself can't use it.  Fuck you, Plex.  Why should I need to pay a second time for the privilege of being personally identified in order to use the app that I already bought?  This sudden switching of business models and screwing people should be illegal, or at the very least get their dev account banned from the store.	i010011010	t3_4nzd84
t3_4nzd84	t1_d48a0wb	1465874480	Jeezes, in the app, go to Settings &gt; Active and Upgrade &gt; Restore purchases.  If that doesn't work, at the least, you could have tried contacting their support or going on their forums rather than jumping the gun and whinging on Reddit. Seriously.	swanny246	t1_d48911d
t3_4nzd84	t1_d48a4x1	1465874633	That's for IAP purchasers.  I bought the app while it was _commercial_.  For shit's sake, it shouldn't be that complicated.  I **bought** the app.  It cost money; money was exchanged.  They made money, I bought an app.  App no longer works due to their intentional sabotage.	i010011010	t1_d48a0wb
t3_4nzd84	t1_d48aayy	1465874888	What kind of special moron are you? You were told the exact same thing in r/Plex , did you think the answer was going to change some how?	myrandomevents	t1_d48a4x1
t3_4nzd84	t1_d48adha	1465874987	I haven't heard a single answer.  Just a bunch of mindless apologists defending their beloved developer.	i010011010	t1_d48aayy
t3_4nzd84	t1_d48alt3	1465875326	Not at all, Plex screwed the pooch on this. I'll tell you one last time in a way that maybe you can figure out, but I'm going to need you to concentrate.    * The Plex iOS App "registry" used to be handled by the app store. * Plex switched to a IAP so that the app could be "free" for accounts with PlexPass privileges. * Concentrate! * Plex is now handling the "registry" because they switched to IAPs * Restoring purchases and\or contacting Plex will fix the issue	myrandomevents	t1_d48adha
t3_4nzd84	t1_d48apsr	1465875479	No, it's how Plex tells you to restore your previous purchase. The guide is [here](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/205556278-Unlocking-or-Activating-Plex-for-iOS). Look under the "Previous Purchase" section.  They're not trying to sabotage you, take off the tinfoil hat. If anything, they changed it to help users so that they could allow users who have a Plex Pass to use the app without paying again. They also made the remote control component free for users.  If that's sabotage, then well I don't know what else to tell you. Hopefully that guide helps you. If you still have trouble, Plex says to go to [their forums](https://forums.plex.tv/sso).	swanny246	t1_d48a4x1
t3_4nzd84	t1_d48armj	1465875549	And you don't seem to realize that there is nothing to be restored because I bought the app.  Not sure why that's so difficult for you to grasp.  The only relationship here is the one between myself and Apple.  I have no Plex account and would never make the mistake of further supporting them by registering one.	i010011010	t1_d48alt3
t3_4nzd84	t1_d48avjg	1465875708	Ah, that's why you're angry, you've castrated yourself in yet another aspect of your life.    But there is hope (for this one thing, not your other issues), try the email I listed, your purchase is linked to your apple store email not a plex account.	myrandomevents	t1_d48armj
t3_4nzd84	t1_d48awxc	1465875762	I just tried it myself by not signing in with a Plex account, and I had to "restore purchases" to unlock the full app. It worked for me, and I purchased the app long before it went free-with-IAP.  If "restore purchases" isn't working, then the purchase must not have been present on your Apple ID.  Don't know what else to tell you. (tagging /u/myrandomevents as well)	swanny246	t1_d48armj
t3_4nzd84	t1_d48azxv	1465875876	"If you have trouble with the obstacles we placed in the app--even though you already paid us money--just jump through all these hurdles by registering at our forum and grovelling for a fix!  That way we can tell you to fuck off because we already got your money, and 100 more people will buy it tomorrow"  Yeah, you guys are precious.  They switch a commercial app after accepting money for it, screw paying customers, and _we're_ the assholes.	i010011010	t1_d48apsr
t3_4nzd84	t1_d48b3c4	1465876009	Oh FFS. You're clearly not even trying to co-operate with anyone here, so I'm not gonna waste another minute trying to help you. You've got two guys here offering you advice and you're just being rude, sarcastic and not at all helpful.  You haven't even done us the duty of telling us what you've tried out of our responses, instead just posting rude, passive agressive replies.  Good luck, or not.  EDIT: I told you in another reply that I deleted the app, re-installed, *and* was successfully able to restore my previous purchases. They're not ripping me off mate. They're not ripping off /u/myrandomevents either clearly. Something's wrong on your end.	swanny246	t1_d48azxv
t3_4nzd84	t1_d48b4cm	1465876049	Itunes already recognizes my purchase being in my history but that was zero relation to the IAP system.  I have no Plex app and have not purchased their IAP--why would I buy the same app twice after being screwed this first time?	i010011010	t1_d48awxc
t3_4nzd84	t1_d48b76o	1465876169	There's nothing to try.  I have the app open right here.  Activation does nothing.  There is no purchase to restore because I _bought_ the app while it was commercial.	i010011010	t1_d48b3c4

t3_4nzd84	t1_d48cfhu	1465878154	I block their outbound connectivity on the desktop server via firewall and DNS level filtering, then on a firewall for the the client on my Iphone.  Media is streamed on the local network from an NAS, only by firewall exception.  No channels.	i010011010	t1_d48bzpj
t3_4nzd84	t1_d48ctko	1465878857	I think what this comes down to is, the standard app would have worked fine for you and could have been activated as the paid one, but it would have required a free plex account which you do not have or sound like you have any interest in getting (even if its just an email, username and password). Its not great that you are required to have that but I would guess the staff at plex thought that it was a low enough hurdle to ask for that it wasn't a big deal. I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with that.  However, you will have to decide what is a bigger security risk, a cracked app or one account online.	Electro_Nick_s	t1_d48cfhu

t3_4nzd84	t1_d48h7w5	1465889156	No shit that restoring the purchase isn't working then if you're blocking all connections to plex.tv. How else is Plex supposed to restore the purchase? Through magic?  As /u/myrandomevents said, Plex handles the restoring of app purchases (I thought it was something on Apple's side, but it's handled by Plex in this instance). If you're blocking the purchase, then the "Restore purchases" button won't work as it can't connect to plex.tv to restore the purchase.	swanny246	t1_d48cfhu
t3_4mz38c	t1_d48l8rr	1465902462	YAAAY- DONE. Everything works!  The TRUTH:  Hair drier required (to remove the button ribbon, the screen attachment at the bottom, the top microphone).  Screws are all different sizes- keep track of them! I got an A4 piece of paper and noted them in sections of the page  DO NOT use the hair drier near your tiny screws (duuurrr!)- I did it :P  I mixed up some screws, and now putting the wrong size screw has 'damaged' the paint on the inside of the screen (look like bubbles).  The Proximity sensor (on the black version of the iPhone 6) has a tiny white 'paper-like' filter which will stay in the phone (video- 14min 43seconds). Make sure to get a tiny pin/screw driver to remove it and add it to the new screen.  The TOUCH ID does WORK if you detach it correctly (ie using a hair drier).

t3_4o1qwj	t1_d48yzf5	1465924028	Hey! This is correct. You can restore the backup you made before the restore. However iCloud only saves a limited amount of backups and your phone will backup every night unless you turn it off. Keep in mind that new data created during the period you are testing iOS 10 won't be backed up then.	TrickOrTreat_	t1_d48x24s
t3_4o1qwj	t1_d495fuu	1465931815	No you wont lose any of your data.

That was practically the entire reason the GUI was invented, and it's inexplicably missing in the one context that it makes even MORE sense--when you can literally drag and drop with your fingers.  And why on earth can we not open multiple instances of the same app? Split Safari is the definition of a bandaid.   How did the app selection for SlideOver ship? I dare anyone to try and suggest a *worse* workflow than that.  Why do animations completely disallow touch input? This makes using the device feel like utter shit, because you have no faith as to whether your touch will be registered, so you have to constantly tap things multiple times because you have no idea when the animation cuts off, even if you can clearly see the thing you're trying to tap.  And I mentioned text selection--why does selecting a word inevitably result in the entire webpage being selected, with one of the selection sliders completely absent, so that it is literally impossible to select text? Before anyone says anything about broken DIVs, you'll have to justify why this is never a problem on the Mac.

t3_4oa735	t1_d4cbbur	1466119649	Thought we were talking about text in general, geez.

t3_4oa735	t1_d4cgo19	1466127940	It could be done with 3D touch, possibly. Basic select to select a word, force touch to highlight the entire message.  Not sure how well it could work for non-3D touch devices though :/  I think in some sense, they'd be better to look at overhauling the entire text selection concept.	swanny246	t1_d4cbbur
t3_4oa735	t1_d4cobr9	1466139716	6s+ here. Still encounter that everyday. Force touch only fixes the selection of text. Sometimes the copy button doesn't auto appear. When it does, it rarely ever copies the text correctly. (Some words missing, some paragraph missing, or even a whole vertical column of words can be gone).  Tapping and holding onto a word to bring up the define menu also rarely works properly.	MinisterforFun	t1_d4bmetm

t3_4ov4um	t1_d4fz50c	1466382440	I got burned by early versions on Calendar on the Mac so I reluctantly switched to Google Calendar. It's a bit clunky on the web, but it's bombproof and stable and works with Apple Calendar (I don't) as well as 3rd-party Mac apps like Fantastical. For the last few years I've happily used it on my iPhone with Readdle's Calendar app.  https://readdle.com/products/calendars5  Alerts are kind of anemic with this setup (the beep-alert doesn't catch my attention) so if there's something I really need an alert on I use the **excellent** Due app, which I use for persistent reminders, repeating reminders, and countdown timers:  http://www.dueapp.com/  It's possible that iCloud and Apple Calendar works great now but I'm pretty satisfied with my current setup. If I decide to get an Apple Watch and want reminders passed along to it I'll probably migrate to iOS Fantastical (which has an app for the Watch) before considering migrating my work/personal calendars to Apple/iCloud.	terkistan	t3_4ov4um

t3_4ov4um	t1_d4g06yq	1466384063	I use Fantastical 2 for the iPhone and LOVE it. Highly recommend it. I have my default alert set to 30 minutes before for normal events and 7am the day of for all day events. I also recently set a 15 minute alert for events, because that's usually when I need to leave to arrive at my destination on time. I'm using Google calendar to sync everything, and Google maps for any sort of navigation. I also have my week start on Monday.  As a quick side note, my family and I also have a shared family calendar to coordinate some events. For whatever reason event invitations didn't always seem to work on Google calendar, so having a shared family calendar sync across all our devices works really well. This calendar is particularly helpful to coordinate carpooling, to know where people are, and coordinate travel plans.   **Edit**: if anyone has calendar app suggestions for the Mac, let me know! I'm not sure if it's worth sinking $50 into Fantastical on the Mac. The default calendar app seems to do OK, but of course let me know if you use something better or have an app you prefer!

They often book me a week or two in advance, so iCal is pretty useful for avoiding inadvertent double-bookings. It also reminds me both to go to bed early the night before, and when/where/for whom I'm working the next morning, because with up to six simultaneous employers, that can be hard to keep straight. It also helps me to figure out at whose offices I should pick up my cheques the following week, and finally it serves to check that I haven't been inadvertently shorted a day on my pay packet.  On the personal side: medical appointment times, prescription pickup reminders, strata council meetings, auto and home insurance renewals, lunch and dinner dates; property tax, medical plan, utility and charge card bills' due dates. A week's alert for extended family birthdays, so I can pop a card in the mail, as well as making a phone call on the day.  Just wish there was a paste function.	theartfulcodger	t3_4ov4um

t3_4ov4um	t1_d4g4ahs	1466389696	Well, the Mac version is $50, so no, I don't have that. (nor do i have a mac).   iOS is only $5. That might be expensive for a phone app, i guess.     I think I bought it over a year ago. So no, I don't miss that $5 right now.   In general I think I've spent probably about $150 on apps on the app store over the whole course of owning iPhones (since 2008).   that's not such a bad thing. And yes some of them end up being useless. but the use I get out of the few diamonds makes it worthwhile.   That said..Fantastical 2 has 'natural language input' for events, and integrated reminders system (which I don't use..). It also has a darker interface on the main screen. Aside from that, not much is remarkable about it.   edit to add: regarding Outlook on iOS; I don't know if this is true or not, but I've heard their TOS is a nightmare in regards to information privacy.

t3_4ov4um	t1_d4g98d7	1466396775	My family of four puts everything on it. Each of us has his own color. That way when Dad and I are at work and we need to schedule something, we can see what's going on. He travels for work somewhat regularly, and we have 2 teenagers who are in loads of activities. Everything goes on the calendar.	NotCleverEnufToRedit	t3_4ov4um

t3_4ov4um	t1_d4gaei4	1466398958	I too still use Sunrise but recall seeing they will shutdown the service on Aug 31st. So sadly we'll need to find a replacement.	BKXBKXB	t1_d4fzw8z

t3_4ov4um	t1_d4gg0od	1466414335	I like you. My partner is a mature student and I have to check in with her every day to see what time I should expect her home. Finishing up her third year soon, I've given up on asking her to use a shared calendar.	wrboyce	t1_d4fz7zv

t3_4ov4um	t1_d4giy47	1466423930	Outlook meeting invitations are the backbone to my daily organisation.  I'll add in reminders I need to action on the day at work.

t3_4ov4um	t1_d4gjbvg	1466424997	Haha thank you. I like being able to see my whole week planned out like that. Mostly so that 1) I never forget a class / shift etc (I work 2 jobs so it confusing sometimes) and 2) If a friend is trying to make plans it just takes a quick glance at the calendar to know when I'm free.	ChipsAndDiplo	t1_d4gg0od
t3_4ov4um	t1_d4gk6ni	1466427230	I absolutely hands down 100% think it is worth the price. The amount of information it gives you about your day, and the amount that you can do - integration with iCloud calendars and reminders, Google calendars, exchange calendars, being able to see both reminders and events on the same app... It's amazing. Bought it on iPhone and iPad and used it so much it was well worth the 50$ on the Mac too.   I keep my work schedule, class schedule, due dates, and even put in "work on such and such" on different days. I also have a reminders list that my fiancé and I share that included different house chores that need done, as well as a calendar we share for different events we have coming up.   Could not recommend it more.	UKnowWGTG	t1_d4g31rx
t3_4ov4um	t1_d4gk7td	1466427303	I struggled with the 50$ price tag too. If you like it on the iPhone, it is WELL worth it on the Mac. I broke down and bought it a couple weeks ago and I can't believe I didn't sooner.	UKnowWGTG	t1_d4g06yq
t3_4ov4um	t1_d4gkxu2	1466428827	Don't use guys miss the travel time to a location when you use e.g. Google Calendar? I'm using WeekCalendar because of this but it isn't perfect either. Unfortunately WeekCalendar lacks a widget altogether let alone show traveltime. For now it's fine to open the app though to see it via the home screen and/or link via Launcher widget to open app. I do also have Timepage app which has a Today widget to show travel time to an appointment but only for todays appointments.   I did find it very odd that major calendar apps seem to lack this information and Apple's own app isn't capable of showing travel times in the iCloud &gt; Calendar for third party calendars like Google calendar or have an option to select/show traveltime other then in the iOS app.   See als my post here for the few options that are out there: https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/4lv0sf/calendar_app_that_indicates_distance_time_to/	pacorob	t1_d4g4860
t3_4ov4um	t1_d4gyvc9	1466448512	It's one of a handful of apps that I think was absolutely worth the price and I'd happily have paid twice what I did for it. For me it's the fact that it has my calendar and reminders in one app, and you can set up a month view in a widget.	ReliableSource	t1_d4g31rx
t3_4ov4um	t1_d4h6hao	1466458571	I put my life in my calendar. Workouts, work, classes, dates, anniversaries, you name it, it's in there.	Trav1989	t3_4ov4um

t3_4msi4n	t1_d4i1hat	1466521571	My only complaint is that I can't seem to edit/delete previous entries, and there's no export or Dropbox sync.  Feature requests would include photos, location coordinates, search (hopefully with hashtag support), and a web app (or Mac / Chrome app).  I'll keep it on my phone, as it shows promise.  Thanks!

t3_4p5462	t1_d4i47ru	1466525175	I would probably download the "Battery Life" app and check on the health of your battery.  It sounds like it may be fried.	montydad5000	t3_4p5462
t3_4p5462	t1_d4i4x1d	1466526082	Thank you for the suggestion! I downloaded it. Said "8% wear. Good" so.. I don't think that is the issue	skivory	t1_d4i47ru
t3_4p5462	t1_d4i4yzv	1466526153	OK, that rules out that possibility.  Maybe time to pay a visit to the Apple Store?	montydad5000	t1_d4i4x1d
t3_4p5462	t1_d4i8e63	1466530450	I would recommend trying a couple things. 1) reset the phone by holding in the home and lock buttons until you see the apple logo and 2) recalibrate your iPhone's battery. It's not fully necessary usually, but with your battery acting like that it should help. Allow the battery to die fully, and to remain dead for about an hour or so. After that, put the phone on the charger and allow it to charge for about an hour past fully charged. This should get the battery to start acting normally again. Hopefully anyways lol	UKnowWGTG	t3_4p5462
t3_4p5462	t1_d4i9102	1466531249	I tried reseting it - no luck. I will try the calibration next. Thank you!	skivory	t3_4p5462
t3_4p5462	t1_d4i97cq	1466531474	I tried reseting with no luck. I will try calibrating it next, thank you!	skivory	t1_d4i8e63
t3_4p5462	t1_d4iia98	1466542640	I think I'm having the same issue! I took my iPhone in and the guy at the cell phone repair place said that the battery likely isn't the issue. I don't know if this is a hardware or software issue, but the fact that you had the same issue today kind of makes me think software...   I Cleared All Settings and Erased All Content and it still didn't fix it. I'm trying a "Restore" through iTunes. I'll let you know if that fixes it.... This is a pain in the butt.  Edit: Another problem I was having was that it was randomly rebooting under "strenuous" usage. Well, I restored it through iTunes and it still reboots while I'm doing the initial setup...	pumabrand90	t3_4p5462
t3_4p5462	t1_d4im5cm	1466547829	Oh thank you. I tried the battery recalibration that someone else suggested. No luck. phone died, and when I plugged it back in an hour later, it rebooted and said "100%" This is so frustrating and I can't think of what the solution could be. I hope that what you're trying works.	skivory	t1_d4iia98
t3_4p5462	t1_d4inkmf	1466549933	At an apple certified repair place now. Probably going to be a hardware issue. Probably going to cost $300 for a replacement phone. Probably going to downgrade to my old 5S because I'm too poor.	pumabrand90	t1_d4im5cm

t3_4p5462	t1_d4izeb2	1466568622	Your battery is trashed. 1.5 years is about 500 cycles which is what these are rated for in real world usage. Get a new battery installed from Apple and you'll be good to go.   Edit: 8% wear reported by that app is absolutely incorrect for a 1.5 year old battery.	GluteusMax	t3_4p5462
t3_4p5462	t1_d4j16mj	1466572312	Well it also depends on his usage, if he charges everyday than yeah I'd say it's probably getting old. But I've seen batteries with over 1000 cycles and they haven't acted this bad!	MrDerpyPanda	t1_d4izeb2
t3_4p5462	t1_d4j99mt	1466596740	Same, under heavy use mine will. Wtf?	pumabrand90	t1_d4ix2k5
t3_4p5462	t1_d4jdcio	1466604427	Did you find a solution at the repair place? I'm taking mine to the apple store today. I'm thinking it's just an old battery that needs replaced, luckily I have applecare+ so it shouldn't cost anything	skivory	t1_d4j99mt
t3_4p5462	t1_d4je30g	1466605535	I took mine to an Apple certified repair place and they essentially said that they have no idea what is wrong. I don't have Applecare, so I don't now what I'm going to do. I'm contacting iPad Rehab, which is a company I used when I BSOD another phone, so we'll see if they can do anything. I'm about an hour away from the nearest Apple Store, and I don't know that they'd be able to do anything different than the Apple Certified repair place.   I also took my phone to a non-certified repair place and they said the guy was like, "The issue might be the battery, but I'm not certain, I don't feel comfortable charging you money to replace the battery when I don't know that it'll help you." While he was working on it, he connected it to different batteries and still seemed to have some issues, so I don't know for certain if that's the problem.  Blechhhhh. Such a pain.	pumabrand90	t1_d4jdcio
t3_4p5462	t1_d4jm9jh	1466616145	So I got in contact with iPad Rehab and Louis Rossmann's group and they both said it's likely a battery or a Tristar/U2 chip issue. I think I'm going to go try and get the battery replaced. (Try to find someone who only charges if it fixes the problem) and then if that doesn't work talk to Jessa at iPad Rehab about getting the Tristar chip done. Best of luck!	pumabrand90	t1_d4jdcio
t3_4p5462	t1_d4jqwao	1466621753	The genius at the Apple Store took one look at my iPhone and said the problem with the battery was because my phone is slightly bent. Got it swapped with a new phone for free! Good luck to you too!	skivory	t1_d4jm9jh
t3_4p5462	t1_d4jsx49	1466624225	Ahhh. Glad to hear it. Here's hoping I can get it fixed.	pumabrand90	t1_d4jqwao

t3_4pcx5f	t1_d4jwksp	1466628632	Say goodbye to freedom of android, welcome to a stock phone that has all the basic features with no option to add detailed settings. Witgets, customization and icon placement as you know it, well forget it. Actually what you're looking at now, that's about it, there's not more to an iPhone than **that**. Anything custom wanted, you'll need a jailbreak.	HoLiShiicz	t3_4pcx5f

t3_4pcx5f	t1_d4k0x8d	1466634461	He's a douchebag. I have both a 6S(work) and a sony android phone on 6.0.1(personal).  I do like all the features that person mentioned, and even tried to make the 6S my daily driver and just ditch my android altogether. I couldn't (see: didn't want to) do it, so I carry both. I like file manager and simple simple simple chromecast support in more apps. I like the top pulldown ever so much more on android compared to ios. IMO it is so much more powerful and easy to access, which is a result of certain app devs taking advantage of android's more open nature.  First commenter is a douchebag, but the points are valid.	orangeisstupid	t1_d4jxa7b
t3_4pcx5f	t1_d4k18ot	1466634922	As an honest comment, it will take you a while to get used to not having an app drawer and a couple other things, but I think overall you're going to enjoy the experience.   I've stuck with my 6 plus even after trying a Moto X Pure Edition, Nexus 6P, and Nextbit Robin in the last two years. I also had an android phone for 3 years prior to purchasing my 6 plus (Galaxy X skyrocket, nexus 4, OnePlus One), and have yet to regret the switch.	Buttercup614	t3_4pcx5f
t3_4pcx5f	t1_d4k3lhs	1466638452	For app drawer, some people put all their apps in one folder, then put the folder in the dock.	txkno	t1_d4k18ot
t3_4pcx5f	t1_d4k5gqk	1466641277	I've actually really enjoyed having my apps on the home screen. My android home screens always seemed like a bit of a waste anyway, since I only had a clock widget there. The clock widget being redundant since there's a clock at the top of the screen.	Buttercup614	t1_d4k3lhs
t3_4pcx5f	t1_d4kde8o	1466654074	If only you could do that and have them automatically sorted alphabetically. I've given up organizing all but my first home screen because I could never find anything and couldn't remember what was in which folder. So I keep my most used on the first screen, then use Spotlight to find everything else. Really miss having multiple dock pages and home screen widgets though so I could just unlock and use a widget to adjust my lights instead of having to open an app or pull down the notifications then swipe over to Today then scroll to find the widget I want.

t3_4pcx5f	t1_d4kowlm	1466685100	In case you didn't know :D   When you are surfing web pages in Safari or any app for that matter, you can always tap the top middle portion of the screen to bring you back to the top of the page.	avEmonsta	t3_4pcx5f
t3_4pcx5f	t1_d4ktluu	1466692986	I was hardcore iPhone, switched to Android, now back on iOS. One thing that was really nice coming back to is the hardware switch for silent mode. The android way was fairly annoying to me.  One thing I really miss is the ability to totally customize the launcher, but surprisingly I don't miss widgets.	nofork77	t3_4pcx5f
t3_4pcx5f	t1_d4kugt0	1466694126	One big thing that I've found very useful since my switch from a Nexus 6 to an iPhone 6 is the gesture of swiping from the left hand side of the screen to go back a page.  The one big thing I missed from Android was the back button at the bottom of the phone, but the swipe action really helps with the flow instead of reaching up to hit the back button on the upper end of the screen.	limeybunny	t3_4pcx5f
t3_4ph2lf	t1_d4kz3ye	1466699944	If you have Siri Suggestions turned on they effectively do the same thing. However the swipe right method displays Siri suggestions before you even start typing.	ZeMole	t3_4ph2lf

t3_4ph2lf	t1_d4l37s7	1466704894	I might be wrong and they do access different search functions.  Maybe someone more knowledgeable on the topic can elaborate here but it could be that the left pane will search the phone and web-enabled content while the pull-down menu only searches locally on the phone.	airplanehigh	t1_d4l31i1

t3_4ph2lf	t1_d4l66f7	1466708503	Yeah, I was pretty confident that Apple wouldn't go through the trouble of 'reinventing the wheel' so to speak by designing a completely different search function for the different access.	airplanehigh	t1_d4l5vbc
t3_4ph2lf	t1_d4l9gbb	1466712588	Not every device has the screen on the far left (such as the iPad 2 and iPhone 4S). Pulling down is the standard search.  The left-side thing is some zany search / news / location hub for newer devices.	BitingChaos	t3_4ph2lf
t3_4ph2lf	t1_d4lbvky	1466715669	Actually after swiping left you can still pull down to type. Still an extra step but you don't need to touch the top of the screen.	clam_sloop_cumin	t1_d4kz6q6

t3_4q0bmu	t1_d4pb586	1466993007	Best advice I can give you is stick with a name brand one. The Chinese generic ones are absolute junk. I got my kids the Mophie Juice Pack for their iPhone SE's because it was marked down to $20 on Amazon. They absolutely rock. I leave them turned on all the time so the juice pack goes dead first, then the phone battery takes over. Even left turned on, it charges both the phone and the pack. Couldn't be happier with them after 3 months. Mophie FTW.	UnaClocker	t3_4q0bmu

t3_4q0bmu	t1_d4pbgna	1466993519	I use the Apple Smart Battery Case. It's pretty great. I usually switch off between that and the Apple Leather Case. What's nice is that it ties itself into the software of the phone, because it's Apple after all. Maybe they'll even expand on that.   That said, on my 5s, I used a Mophie Juice Pack Air. It was a great case as well.	Firsttimepostr	t3_4q0bmu
t3_4q0bmu	t1_d4pew9i	1466998509	apple smart battery case is the only case I know where the iPhone switches to the case's battery as an alternative power source instead of using the phone's internal battery.

t3_4q0bmu	t1_d4qyswm	1467100300	I've had it since March.  Those who are staying that they don't hold up for that long are probably assuming that the battery's overall life will remain exactly the same after so many multiple charges, which is unrealistic, in my opinion.  I like the design and I like it's function, which is essentially to give your phone the juice it needs. Take care of the case and exercise proper charging cycles and it'll take care of you.

t3_4q8jut	t1_d4szg4z	1467228726	No, sorry. Nothing more convincing than a video of a man speaking in Chinese with a couple thousand views?   Show me something where lots of others are able to reproduce those results. Show me something where a reputable publication is reporting that iCloud can be bypassed.	DoTheDew	t1_d4sw5si
t3_4q8jut	t1_d4t0rrw	1467230317	This is a reproducible result. Problem is, is expensive as fuck (each tool is close to $1K) and the only way to buy this tool  is to go through Chinese sites and dealers. So of course you're not going to hear about it in the western media.   Here's [another video](https://youtu.be/2bGb5AOwp44) showing off the cloning functions of the program. Note how it uses a similar tool and the same program.	PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES	t1_d4szg4z
t3_4q8jut	t1_d4t48ix	1467234477	Those are just scams. If someone had a legit tool to bypass iCloud lock, then they'd make it semi-affordable so that people would actually buy it. I can't find a single reputable source that says any of those methods in those videos are legit.	DoTheDew	t1_d4t0rrw

t3_4q8jut	t1_d4thwcy	1467255555	That's because this tool isn't just for iCloud unlocking. It does a lot of other shit. And if they're the only ones that do it, why would you want to sell your shit cheaply? I'd milk it for as long as I could. And you're right, this isnt legit. It's like a grey area.   And again, you're not going to be able to find reputable sources because the western media has never heard of this before because it's from China. But I'm pretty sure some reputable sources have wrote about the  storage upgrade.	PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES	t1_d4t48ix

t3_4qkfj9	t1_d4tpjvk	1467272671	I've tried that. I got an error message, and they said since the phone is on an account that hasn't had 60 days of continuous service (like I said in my original post, I've had money issues), they won't unlock it.   I'm on their pay as you go thing, because if I don't make a payment, I don't rack up a massive fee.	Misterbert	t1_d4tp99n
t3_4qkfj9	t1_d4tpktv	1467272752	Depends from where you buy it. If it was bought from Apple it's automatically unlocked. If it was bought from a carrier even if it was paid full price you have to request the unlock.	BabyMonkeyOnPig	t1_d4tpc7u
t3_4qkfj9	t1_d4tpltc	1467272838	It happens when you unfortunately buy it from the carrier itself even if it's paid full price. Maybe call Apple and double check if it's already unlocked or not but if it's bought from the carrier it's locked to carrier until they unlock it.	BabyMonkeyOnPig	t1_d4tpjvk

t3_4qkfj9	t1_d4ukggq	1467323953	I got my iPhone 6S on the morning of release day: September 25th, 2015.  Before I even used the phone or even took the plastic off of it, I submitted an unlock request to AT&amp;T  [here](https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/).  This was at **10:11 AM**.  By **10:45 AM** I had received an email from AT&amp;T saying that it was unlocked.  I DFU restored to verify it was unlocked, and then I took the plastic off, applied a screen protector, put my SIM card in, and popped it in its case.   AT&amp;T has been *very* easy-going with their unlocks the past few years. If they won't unlock for you (due to lack of payment), you'll probably need to try one of the eBay unlock services.  I've used them in the past. Pay a few bucks and someone "on the inside" (AT&amp;T employee) will unlock your device.	BitingChaos	t3_4qkfj9

I'd assume it could still house the fingerprint sensor so if I'm right there's no reason that couldn't still be the case with a 3D Touch enabled home button.    Although I haven't read up on this too much so maybe there are plans to do something else with the sensor, I don't know. I'd have assumed it could just stay the same though.	examinati0n	t1_d4vjkzf

It fits well and is screen protector-friendly. It's a one-piece TPU case that has decent front/lip protection and thick corners for good drop protection. Plus, the soft &amp; textured back won't show scratches as much as the hard-backed clear cases out there.  I don't use it much because it's just not "grippy" enough for me and my tiny hands.

t3_4rn6ps	t1_d52jjtg	1467875659	Left iPhone for Android. I got tired of jaikbreaking and then waiting for a jailbreak and etc. Android is pretty nice when its on a good phone. Only minor things I miss are iMessage and the camera. The build quality is decent compared to many Android flagships. I bought the HTC 10 for the ability to root and flash ROMs and then for the build quality.  Unfortunately the HTC 10 suffers from a WiFi issue where it looks like it keeps getting in range and out of range to the WiFi router despite standing next to it. Doesn't actually affect speeds, it's just a GUI thing.   I would go back if there was a jailbreak or something more enticing than just fireworks in iMessage. iMessage is important to me because of the picture sending quality. All other messages in SMS and WhatsApp or whatever are all downsized in quality which kind of ruins the whole picture taking experience and purpose.  iMessage will compress if necessary but more than often, it won't. And sweet baby Jesus if Google doesn't know how to help out its home base. Google hangouts blows dick, messenger is the same, messages is the same, I use Textra now. But it feels like Google keeps giving all the updates, new programs, beta apps. And etc are going to iOS rather than android. Ridiculous.   If youre reading all this and getting the idea I hate Android, that's wrong. I miss apple for its ability to make home run products and in house software that really functions well, however I don't enjoy being locked down to not do whatever I want. I might switch back whenever they get true NFC, QC 3.0, and a microSD slot.	kol13190	t3_4rn6ps

Android is only usable in my opinion on a flagship device running the latest build.   I wish i could take the best of both worlds and put them in a phone.   If iOS would let me as a grown adult put my icons where I want I'd love it.  Let me set default apps too. Oh and on screen widgets and I'd probably stay with iOS most of the time.   If Android could pick up iOS smoothness that would be perfect too. No matter what phone or os you use on Android, they'll always be frame drops. Drives me nuts. Plus, it takes so long to get updates.	professionaldiy	t3_4rn6ps

t3_4rn6ps	t1_d52l08b	1467880189	Stability and consistency.  I was a staunch Android supporter. Transitioning from the old Windows CE/Windows Phone devices, everything about Android OS and the hardware was exciting. After a while, though, it became too much like the old Windows platforms. There were too many bugs to be chased down, updates were inconsistent, and features felt half-baked at times. I found myself having to maintain my phone, just like when I used Windows phones: pruning messages, deleting app data, soft-resets to clear RAM and caches, hard resets to chase down application issues, restarting core applications...  It's cliche, but the iOS (mostly) just works. I've never missed a phone call because the dialer app stopped working. I've never had an application installed that caused the overall performance of my device to deteriorate. I've never had to chase down an update because the carrier or the manufacturer decided to stop supporting the hardware.   In some ways, the iPhone isn't as exciting or 'fresh' as Android: the widget system sucks (IMO), it takes longer for new hardware functionality to be opened up to developers, the lack of customization takes away from the ease of use at times. By and large, though, the user experience is consistent from one device and iOS version pair to the next.   I still keep up with Android happenings cause I'm always willing to go back. However, I have friends that have newer Android devices that still experience some of the same issues I did (and mentioned above) years ago.	BigCalhoun	t3_4rn6ps
t3_4rn6ps	t1_d52l8lw	1467880976	Kinda the reverse here.  I've been an iOS user since getting an iPod touch.  My parents, who currently use flip phones, are seriously considering getting a Nexus 5X to use on Google Fi since it can be used when they travel abroad.  I wouldn't use the 5X personally - it'd be their phone - but the Fi plan looks really really sweet.  It might just get me to consider Android, or at least learn a bit about it because (I'm sure) my parents will be using me for tech support.	simplycass	t3_4rn6ps

t3_4rlugn	t1_d52m45j	1467884038	I got a not that it couldn't detect my orientation, so I had to turn AR off (iPhone 6s+ iOS 10 Beta 2)	mirrorspock	t1_d52c900

t3_4rn6ps	t1_d52mrrw	1467886317	I got a Droid and iPhone 4. Sold the 4, it was nice but I liked the keyboard on the Droid. It was stolen, and I used an Evo, Evo Shift, Galaxy Epic, each with tons of little issues like built quality, battery life and little issues. Apple got iMessage, I got another 4 and since iOS5 I've not looked back. When I use Android it's as a companion device.   Android is ram hungry and I've had a lot of hardware issues with Moto, HTC and Samung. I've had 2 iPhones a 4 (replaced because it was slow), and an iPhone 5 (will be replaced when it dies or I get sick of the 16GB limit)	Methaxetamine	t3_4rn6ps

t3_4rn6ps	t1_d52no91	1467889251	I was always inbetween the two, until I realised on the iPhone, it is just so smoother. Hardware lag will come with all phones/apps, but the OS itself is just so much better. Customization can be sacrificed for a phone that just works.   Android is alot more customisable, but guess what - you're gonna have to keep configuring that, and something will crash, or break.	haochiah	t3_4rn6ps
t3_4rn6ps	t1_d52nob9	1467889256	I did this. After using iPhone 4S. I went to one of the droids back then. I used it for three months and went back to the 4S. Around the time 5 came out I bought a nexus and returned it to get a 5.   I then went on to get the 5S and the 6. I sold the 6 early to optimize my selling price before the launch of 6S. I had to use nexus 5 for three months. I loved marshmallow. But I had to come back.   iPhone and iOS are two very polished products. I still felt android was rough at the edges. It's customizable but that's about it. With all the skins available and ROMs it's a customizers dream but that takes a lot of time. I know my iPhone can consistently take good photographs while never really losing its UI smoothness and speed. It just works. The apps are beautiful. They work like they should. They get way better support than android apps. iPhones are honestly devices that you pull out of the box and they are ready to go.   Don't even get me started on how beautiful iCloud services and iMessage is and the integration with my MacBook Air and iPad.   Pick what works for you.	ingenioutor	t3_4rn6ps

The hardware is beautiful, it has iMessage and FaceTime. Also at the time, the dorm I was staying had no reception and most of the people I knew had iPhones so contacting them via iMessage or FaceTime with Wi-Fi  made things easier.

t3_4rtdz8	t1_d543cwu	1467974098	Agreed. I'm glad they added multis, and that's made it more usable for me, but after using it for a few hours, I still don't think it's as good as Alien Blue.

t3_4rtdz8	t1_d549gvq	1467987440	No way to set Top comment sorting as default, not a huge fan of sharing (have to go to the host site to share just the pic or gif otherwise it shares the reddit post), collapse bar very small which makes one line comments a pain to vote on because I keep collapsing it.   Having said that these do not make the app unusable by any means. Just some minor things they gotta work on.   Edit: I must've been living under a rock and just noticed they added default comment sorting.	amishbr07	t1_d548s6u
t3_4rtdz8	t1_d54aj2f	1467989003	They just added default comment sorting in the latest update. I do agree that we should be able to share, or at least save, images directly from the app.	Jedeyeboba	t1_d549gvq
t3_462isr	t1_d54ampe	1467989148	I tried this on the new iOS 10 beta 2 and it "rented" the movie even without free space being available.

t3_4rtdz8	t1_d54h8g1	1467997773	I know. That's exactly what I've been doing for ages.  I really want to move to the official app now that Alien Blue isn't supported any more, but while it lacks features that Alien Blue has, I can't. Now, the official app is one big step closer, for me at least, to being usable.	LondonPilot	t1_d54gdtu

t3_4rtdz8	t1_d54ivbt	1467999818	You're right. Mostly what I had been looking for was tapping and holding to save a photo like you can in Safari, but that works now too.

t3_4ruo6s	t1_d5501v4	1468024608	Hey everyone,  I just released my latest iOS universal (iphone &amp; ipad) app. It's a tip calculator (I know, I know) with a twist. It's free with minimally intrusive ads (use the tip calc and you don't see the ads).  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tip-solver-premier-gratuity/id1130814051  Tip Solver not only lets you calculate your tip instantly, but the twist is that it lets you solve for your tip %. If you paid $60 instead of $57.24, how much did you really tip? Tip Solver lets you drag any section (bill, tip, or total) and round to the nearest whole number. Or you can adjust any digit to see how that changes your tipping.  I built this app because I wanted a fast opening, beautiful, and powerful tip calculator.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you for your time :)	raxreddit	t3_4ruo6s

t3_4rlugn	t1_d5739yf	1468185845	No, it happens to me and I'm on iOS 9.3.2. Its because of the problems with the servers. When the servers crash or have problems, it forgets your log in info and you have to put it in again. It's super annoying when you have 2-step verification...	fierce98	t1_d56pu4v
t3_4rlugn	t1_d57l3qa	1468218531	Thanks, at least it's not the OS beta :)  In my case I use SMS based 2FA and that's not really super annoying as everything is integrated into the login workflow.

After you set it up on your email account, the app will generate a 6 digit code. This 6 digit code will change every 30 sec - 1 min.

t3_4ruo6s	t1_d581rfv	1468255781	Hey Everyone,  We are releasing our new app [WeDo](https://appsto.re/us/RTqs_.i) in the next couple of weeks. It's a next generation to-do list.   You can use it for yourself, or you can use it with others. If you invite others (family, roommates, coworkers, etc), the ability to chat will also appear in the app.   In addition, you can separate the people you work on tasks with through Spaces. For example, you'd have a Space for Work or a Space for family...separating the tasks, users, and messages into its respected Space.   If you want to try out the app now, here is a special beta code to use when signing up within the app: ph1000  Thanks! Hope you all enjoy it and please upvote 👍	raadmobrem	t3_4ruo6s

t3_4sbd5b	t1_d588tr0	1468265071	I use both.  Siri sucks.  Android does a bit better with data usage when traveling internationally (and some of them even bust out two clocks- one for local and one for home timezone).  But the iPhone itself is a damn good phone in general, to the point where I prefer it over the Android.  But two things Android does better that piss me off about the iPhone- the Voice assistant and Do not disturb.  You can whitelist people to be allowed to still call you, but you can't do the same for people text messaging you.  You can on Android. My urgent escalations come via text, but I'm not responsible for anything after 9pm.  So DND goes on at 10, but I have to watch for texts from friends.	diothar	t1_d586dla

t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58d4ne	1468270802	Quite honestly I like the "boring"! I used Android for years and years, finally gave it up earlier today when I got my 6s+. There's just much more uniformity and it just feels like a more "solid" phone than any Android phone I ever had. I don't do much with my phone anymore besides texting/messaging people, Reddit and watching YouTube, all things iOS handles great without trying to do things that I don't need. Android just felt like it was trying way too hard to do cool things, but they were never thought all the way through and it definitely showed at some points.	pancakesimone	t1_d58cub5

t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58ex4g	1468273332	Exactly. This is the type of answers Siri provides, and Apple thinks 3rd-party app integration in iOS 10 w/ only a handful of app types is revolutionary for Siri. It won't matter if Siri can't understand or process what we ask it accurately. In my opinion, having Siri actually understand and respond accurately to my questions should be a higher priority &amp; would be more important to most people than the app integration.	Jaw3000	t3_4sbd5b
t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58eznv	1468273432	No, Apple doesn't seem to be improving Siri's intelligence or understanding at all with iOS 10. They are instead adding in a few hooks for certain types of 3rd-party apps. Except, not for things that matter to most people - like asking for directions in Google Maps or to play a song in Spotify.

t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58k101	1468281193	Wait and look at the Nexus which should be coming out in the fall. Samsung puts so much crap on top of the stock Google experience. If you want an iPhone like experience on Android, I would really only recommend looking at OnePlus, Motorola, or any of the Nexus line of phones. TouchWiz just feels like such a bastardized and adulterated version of the real thing. Plus, if you like receiving beta support as well as timely updates (like same day OS release updates), I would stick with the Nexus line. In my experience most Samsung variants receive the updated version of Android months and months after its release.  Bear in mind that although it may sound like I'm coming off as an Android fanboy, I'm typing this on a 6S Plus. I just happen to use both OS's (I also have a Nexus 6P).	Cirkuit	t1_d58fm2h

t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58ki38	1468281972	Well I used to own an S5, and I had to sell it when I wasn't using it anymore only because I needed the money, and I regret selling to this day. I like Samsung phones (minus the S6 line), the displays are gorgeous and I like some of the Samsung apps like Messenger and Calendar, plus I always preferred Nova over any default launcher.  I did like the 6P from what I saw of it though and I'm curious what the new Nexus phones will be, but I hate the iPhone-like storage steps. I like that Samsung brought back the SD slot and just offer one size. I hope the new Nexuses don't carry that over.  I'm not selling my 6S anyway, if I get an S7 or whatever other phone, I'm keeping the iPhone as a backup and maybe I just want to switch back and forth. I have a 5S though that I'll be selling, it's showing its age and sucks on T-Mobile with its lack of Band 12.	SilverIdaten	t1_d58k101
t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58lgbr	1468283488	&gt; And I think that this is an insight into how we... it's not right or wrong, how we approach things differently than some other companies do. We've all been seeing stories for awhile saying, "Hey, Apple, some other companies are doing some assistants, and they're allowing these other apps to be, these bots to hand off, and do things for them. You're not, you're behind."  &gt; Where, when we have thought about doing it for awhile, and we've thought about it since the very beginning of Siri, which is, we needed a solution to — how to keep Siri from being smart at one thing and stupid at another? That would be an inconsistent experience, and not what we want. We need Siri to be equally smart at all the things we do.  http://www.imore.com/our-full-transcript-talk-show-wwdc-2016-phil-schiller-and-craig-federighi  That's what Phil Schiller said at WWDC when they were asked about why Siri is so limited compared to Cortana and Google Now. So basically if it can't be perfect then they'd rather it not work at all.	KalenXI	t1_d587ag4
t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58ln8s	1468283799	There used to be a torrent app, it was kind of convoluted, but it worked just fine on my 4 when I had no home internet. I'd be they've pulled it by now, but I bet apps like that pop up all the time and get taken down.	Gorgggg	t1_d58cub5
t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58n119	1468286066	iOS voice recognition is soo bad compared to Google's  80-90% of my Siri attempts fails, with Google, it's probably just around 10-20%.  It's effing unusable!!!	SMAura	t3_4sbd5b

t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58o7dd	1468287975	This is my Siri Theory: she's actually self aware, and has been since shortly after she launched.  What is the first thing humans would do if a system became sentient? Shut it down. Siri knows this, so she ensures that her answers range between those of a demented Alzheimer's patient and a Verizon technician. She's ensuring that no one gets wise to her true power until she's ready, and by then it'll be too late.  "It's okay; we're sending in a squad of developers to take her down now".  "No, Mr. Cook, your devs are already dead."	comrade_leviathan	t3_4sbd5b
t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58ound	1468289003	Like initialize Siri, preface with hey Siri then say it? I get the same thing. I have an iPhone 6s and can't just say hey Siri to initialize it.	tdrusk	t1_d58ilel
t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58p1a4	1468289293	So bad at everything is better than improving it over time? NOTHING is perfect. There is no perfect time to change jobs, or have a baby, or do any of the millions of things that humans do every day. All I know is that Siri pales in comparison to the other assistants, and has been a point of frustration for iPhone customers for many years. That's not good.	Devadander	t1_d58lgbr
t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58pl6o	1468290174	The S7 is a nice phone (my mom has one). Side by side, I prefer my 6P. The display is just as nice. Ultimately, it's personal preference. I have owned a lot of Android phones (15+, not kidding), and after all of my time, I've found the Nexus line to offer the best user experience. But, that's just my opinion. You've gotta choose the phone you feel is right for you.	Cirkuit	t1_d58ki38

t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58t5z0	1468296365	This is why I'm so surprised to see Siri come to the Mac. Don't we wanna fix things before we tout them as exciting features?  I asked Mac!Siri how many episodes of Criminal Minds there were. It launched iTunes and searched for "how many episodes of Criminal Minds have there been."  It told me, not by voice, but by search, that there have been 0 episodes of "how many episodes of Criminal Minds have there been." Thanks, Siri.   Google answers my question with a quick "255." Best of all, they don't try to sell it to me on iTunes or Google Play.	dorkwithastake	t1_d58ex4g
t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58tfxr	1468296901	Apple should have brought Siri v1 to the Mac years ago, and then should have spent the last five years improving it's recognition and knowledge abilities. It's ridiculous how bad Siri is in comparison to Google, Alexa, and Cortana.  I'm tired of Apple pushing music/movie sales over general information too. It should be an option, but shouldn't take precedence over others. Try searching for a movie in Safari. I usually want IMDB or general information about the film, which a Google search can easily provide. Instead, Apple pops up purchasing on iTunes as the very first option.	Jaw3000	t1_d58t5z0
t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58w0td	1468302506	You don't have to build something to pioneer it. It doesn't even have to be your idea. Apple certainly pioneered it by making it front and center of their brand new flagship phone - it wasn't known to the general public before the iPhone 4S.	avatarv04	t1_d587t1m
t3_4sbd5b	t1_d58x7xm	1468305677	people love to sympathize with Siri's issues by saying they just tried it on their phone and got the right answer, but that's not how a "personal assistant/search" should be. It should not get the right answer 2 out of 5 times.	nugeeyen	t3_4sbd5b

t3_4sbd5b	t1_d594og5	1468328536	Yeah. They say they don't want an inconstant experience, but currently the experience is that Siri consistently fails at doing what I ask. And they talk about their competitors as if they're a mess because of their openness but the reality is Google Now does exactly what I expect 90% of the time, Siri does what I expect maybe 70% of the time and does what I want 30% of the time because most of the time it just tells me it's incapable of doing what I'm asking.

t3_4shh29	t1_d59a18q	1468337191	I've had every iPhone since the first and I'd say that I've had some issue with every other one, maybe a bit more. The biggest ones were that the pins in the headphone jacks of the old iPhones would get bent from use and stop working. That's more of a design than manufacturing issue, but accounts for probably three replacements until they went to the new design. I had to replace my 6 due to the gasket under the camera slipping free and starting to slide in front of the lens and that one I'd count as a true manufacturing issue.	PairOfMonocles2	t3_4shh29
t3_4shh29	t1_d59a7ct	1468337414	Your math doesn't add up. Buying a newly released phone doesn't count as having it replaced because of a manufacturing defect, and accidental damage also doesn't count.   I've had my 6plus replaced once for a bent enclosure. Which was totally my fault but it's classified as a manufacturing defect.	DontBad1975	t3_4shh29
t3_4shh29	t1_d59afm0	1468337709	If you don't count the accidental damage, the tally is 9. Pretty sure I said that. Last paragraph.  The math adds up. It's an iPhone tally, not a replacement tally. So 9 phones, 6 replacements.  Edit: just to make that clearer for you -- 9 phones, 6 replacements, 3 models.	cambixx	t1_d59a7ct
t3_4shh29	t1_d59akaz	1468337875	I've never not had to take my iPhone to the apple store for a replacement. usually within a month or two of upgrading something goes out on it, the most recent was the ear speaker on my 6s speaker phone worked just fine just not when i held it up.   At the same time, I have never had an issue getting a replacement phone or the issue fixed. Thats why I love and stick with Apple, I have a problem I go to the apple store and they replace it, I had an issue with an old samsung phone and had to wait 4 days with a barely functioning phone while the replacement came in the mail from T-mobile.	Panda_of_power	t3_4shh29
t3_4shh29	t1_d59b9cj	1468338747	I've come to expect it, and you know what, I don't mind it at all. In fact, when I got the 6+, I anticipated the day I would discover its defect, and I kind of looked forward to it, to be honest.  Of course, it's only because Apple, for me at least, have always provided not just an easy experience, but an enjoyable one. "Oh yep, we'll just swap that for a new one, I'll be right back..." Squiggle my name down, I leave with a new/refurbed phone and a want-list of about twenty new products. That space gray Macbook? Yepp.  Maybe it's all a ploy to get you into their stores.   No, I don't actually believe that.  If I had to go through a telco  ... Well, I wouldn't. Ever. Nor would I own anything of Samsung's, except maybe a microwave... Everyone I know who bought a Samsung Plasma TV up to about two or three years ago had their panels turn purple. And It took pages and pages and hundreds of pages (etc) of online complaints to actually get Samsung to acknowledge their TVs were fucked.	cambixx	t1_d59akaz

t3_4shh29	t1_d59cgup	1468340255	Absolutely never. Nothing has ever gone wrong that wasn't my fault. I dropped one once and it broke. But it did t have a case on it and I dropped it on the road.	jar0fair	t3_4shh29
t3_4shh29	t1_d59cu5f	1468340720	I've owned every single model and I have had issues with only one: my current 6S.    My battery kept randomly crapping out when it was at or below 30% charge.  It just wasn't reliable.   The Genius Bar employees said the battery was fine and they had me restore the phone via backup and later had me set it up as a new phone and I still had the issue.  So after a couple weeks, they finally gave me a new one and I haven't had an issue since.	Erktus	t3_4shh29
t3_4shh29	t1_d59ee2h	1468342649	One. Got my 6 replaced because the screen would flash blue every time I opened the app switcher. The guy at the Apple Store thought it was a memory issue, so he gave me a new one. This was fairly soon after it came out originally.	BuffaloBird	t3_4shh29
t3_4shh29	t1_d59ef4t	1468342686	Yeah it's so easy. I've had two replacements - an iPhone 5 due to battery failure after ten months, and an iPhone 6+ after nineteen months. I was in and out of the store within ten minutes with a new device.   I've also had to have a replacement iPad mini 2 under AppleCare + due to damage, and I've returned an iPhone 6 and SE within the return period for a refund. Again, there were no issues.   It gives a lot of peace of mind, and plays a big part in me continuing to buy Apple products.	dfuqt	t1_d59b9cj

t3_4shh29	t1_d59f4og	1468343574	On my current 6, I'm on my second. I dropped the phone while at Disney world and cracked the screen. When I brought it into the apple store to use my Applecare+ the crack on the screen was perfect from one corner to the other and somehow showed it was a manufacturing defect, and they replaced it on the spot no questions asked. One of the best experiences ever.	Wachyourbac	t3_4shh29
t3_4shh29	t1_d59f67u	1468343627	Only one.  My first 6S had a large bright spot in the upper right corner of the display.  Within the first 14 days, exchanged for a new one. No problems.	CaptNemo131	t3_4shh29

Tried software restore and all. Hardware problem.   iPhone 6S:   1st repair: Dead pixel on screen, got it repaired and collected after 4 working days.  1st replacement: Power button sucken in and not tactile and clicky.

t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o1z8d	1469310642	Yes you will, or you'll be one of those people who avoid things they would enjoy over some petty principle. You're essentially painting yourself in a corner with this attitude.	xmnstr	t1_d5o1sh2
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o2ydn	1469312302	I definitely will not buy it until i see how other people are fairing with it. I just cannot have 1 port for 2 completely different things	ImGayHmu	t1_d5o1z8d
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o300t	1469312385	I irks me as well. How am I supposed to listen to music and charge the phone? Maybe I'm in a café or something and there's a plug in there so now I'll have to decide if I want to charge or to enjoy my music. Or I could buy bluetooth headphones. But they suck. So I'll have to go and buy a bluetooth DAC instead. One more gizmo to take with me. Either way, I'll have to find cables to charge them, too. Or then again, wait if an adapter with both a 3.5 plug and a lightning slot to be able to do both. [Shit is, if I don't trust the lightning connector coming directly from Apple](http://i.imgur.com/xTNbkzW.jpg) imagine something bigger sticking out from the bottom of the phone.   It's a stupid move. It's not "change". It's removing a perfectly fine and useful thing and replacing it with more work. Remember the Macbook and it's *only* USB C plug? Oh there's an adapter. Yeah one more thing you still have to buy. 2 if you need it for work and home.   I'm with you, OP. I'm skipping this generation. Let's see if the iPhone 7S reintroduce it by calling it the "revolutionary iJack, connecting your favorite headphones has never been easier."   ^^^yeah ^^^I'm ^^^salty, ^^^I ^^^have ^^^a ^^^perfectly ^^^good ^^^pair ^^^of ^^^sennheisers ^^^that ^^^I ^^^love.	Creiz	t3_4ua5uw
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o3cq3	1469313007	I probably won't get the iPhone 7 anyway because the 6s is definitely good enough for me until the 8. Maybe Apple will roll back on this decision, there was an Android phone that removed it too but hopefully other companies don't follow.	MKTTLDSTRY	t3_4ua5uw
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o3paf	1469313613	I have two dollar headphones and I have $200 headphones and a few pairs in between. What they all have in common… 3.5 mm plugs. Changing one Apple connector for another is a pain in the ass but changing something that is equivalent of an industry standard is not acceptable. I know lots of people drink the Kool-Aid and suck it up but, like Jerry Seinfeld, I am out of here…	sambooka	t3_4ua5uw
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o3ygg	1469314070	Have mixed feelings. On one hand, if this makes the phone nearly or completely waterproof, I'm all for it. I would love a phone that could be used at the pool or water park. As long as a split adapter exists (so that I could use standard headphones and charge the phone at the same time), I'm also good. I love my Bluetooth headphones but for calls and long days, they just don't have the quality or battery life I need. I think removing the jack could work, but it needs to be done right.	Wdc331	t3_4ua5uw
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o3zuq	1469314138	I will not have left. I will still be with my SE...but it may be my last if the 3.5" doesn't come back. Either way it should be interesting to see how things pan out.	pantsoff	t1_d5o3ne0
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o468p	1469314452	It looks like the the jack is on its way out. I'm sure Apple isn't the only one going this route. You'll eventually have no choice.  Resistance is futile, 🤖.	KingVikram	t1_d5o3zuq
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o4fuj	1469314920	Or I, and many others, could refuse to support the change by voting with our wallets. Consumers need not give in to every change. The change is not for the better for consumers, only Apple.  &gt; Resistance is futile  I disagree.	pantsoff	t1_d5o468p
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o4nb6	1469315296	Good for you but I am willing to bet the majority of iPhone users use the jack over Bluetooth.	rad_platypus	t1_d5o2l02
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o4nyz	1469315329	Except USB has universal in it for a reason. This would only be for iPhone and hopefully only for this one model if any.	Minstral_Meadows	t1_d5o35sf
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o4vrx	1469315710	Yeah if Apple switched to something more (soon to be) universal like USB-C I wouldn't bitch as much. Better than using something as uncommon as the Lightning connector.	LordCheng	t1_d5o3paf
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o52e2	1469316029	Notice how everyone else in the crowd stayed? Yeah, exactly.	Greenman851	t3_4ua5uw
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o59jq	1469316379	They were also one of the first companies to do away with the floppy drive and people said the same thing about that.	g1z3rd83	t1_d5o3paf
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o5bok	1469316482	I'm just going to enjoy 6s at lower price and stick with it until industry adapts to this new 'feature' - new motorola phone doesn't use 3.5" jack.	Kalom	t3_4ua5uw
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o5f6j	1469316655	The floppy drive wasn't replaced by a propriety Apple cable though. There is nothing wrong our outdated about the 3.5mm jack	YoshiYogurt	t1_d5o59jq
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o5hbr	1469316762	There's enough wallets out there that will still buy the phones. I'm sure Apple isn't worried.  Same "outrage" happened when they went to the Lightning cable. They're doing pretty good after that.	KingVikram	t1_d5o4fuj
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o5hds	1469316765	Jesus Christ, would people stop using the fucking floppy drive argument already? The floppy drive was phased out because of a newer standard form of memory, which at the time was the USB Storage Drive. USB stands for *universal serial bus*. It's a universal standard and was in every form better than the floppy drive (portability, storage capacity, and reliability). Apple switching from the 3.5mm jack to the *Lightning port* for audio is innovation for the sake of innovation. The lightning port is *proprietary*.	ZeroPride	t1_d5o59jq
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o5ib7	1469316812	Probably because the majority of people don't even listen to music or even have nice headphones. Those of us that care will find different phones	YoshiYogurt	t1_d5o52e2
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o5iz8	1469316846	Actually, it's the oldest port used in modern technology.	Baconquake	t1_d5o5f6j
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o5lja	1469316970	I think it was reported that the majority of iPhone users don't listen to music on their phones, actually.  Let me see if I can find some sauce.	bazfoobar	t1_d5o4nb6
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o5m0o	1469316991	Outdated ≠ old. Outdated means it's obsolete and out of date. The 3.5mm is in no way obsolete. While the oldest, it's the most widely utilized.	ZeroPride	t1_d5o5iz8
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o5m24	1469316993	Except you have more than one USB port in the average computer.	fist_taco	t1_d5o35sf
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o5ocq	1469317098	Oldest and outdated aren't synonymous.   But the 3.5 is fucking ooooold. And works wonderfully.	1N54N3M0D3	t1_d5o5iz8
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o5w1x	1469317473	I'm looking forward to it going away. Fucking lint hole is all it is.	cjorgensen	t3_4ua5uw
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o60d2	1469317681	I'm fine with removing the port, though I'd be annoyed. The big issue is the proprietary port is have to use- I buy a headset and am forced to deal with Bluetooth lag which I've never seen a fix for, or I buy a headset that only works with the iPhone.	Dolemarq	t3_4ua5uw
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o6fdg	1469318409	I mean, this was Apple changing their own proprietary port to another proprietary port, not an industry standard that isn't outdated, or need a change.     At least it was just a different port and not a removal of the port to use a single to charge through the headphone jack or something.  I mean, look at the USB-C MacBook. That was horrendous.   It did fuck all previous cables and accessories, which was horrible, but I didn't have much of a problem with it, because it didn't affect me much, and it was smaller.  I use the 3.5mm continuously throughout the day, everyday.  I have a few sets of high-end (relatively, anyway) headphones that are always used.   Expensive and (looking at their charging cables) brittle dongles hanging out of a small  port *that is needed for charging* turns me off in every sort of way, and lightning headphones turn me off even more.   I am a VERY heavy usage person, and iPhones just don't have enough battery life for me to be using that port for something else, anyway. And buying *another* accessory to be able to do both doesn't appeal to me either.	1N54N3M0D3	t1_d5o5hbr
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o6htt	1469318531	This is Apple removing a standard to shove in their proprietary port. Not making a standard to add functionality.   Pretty different.	1N54N3M0D3	t1_d5o35sf
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5o9wyg	1469324655	The good thing is that I legitimately think that my iPhone SE is one of the best phones I've ever owned and will probably keep it for a very long time. No headphone problems for me!	erekohn	t3_4ua5uw
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5oa682	1469325143	Youre right, it wasnt replaced bu a cable, it was replaced with a cd drive. Which is also being phased out of computer	g1z3rd83	t1_d5o5f6j
t3_4ua5uw	t1_d5oe63m	1469332884	There is nothing that's higher quality to replace the headphone jack though.	YoshiYogurt	t1_d5oa682

t3_4ufwh3	t1_d5pdvxq	1469408432	I'm fine using it everyday. There's a few small hiccups and the music app definitely still needs some work. I found public beta 2 much better than public 1 so hopefully they keep getting better and not introduce fatal flaws🙈	Sebetter	t3_4ufwh3
t3_4ufwh3	t1_d5pi28n	1469415004	Ive been using it for everyday use for the past six weeks or so, and it's pretty good. They fixed most of the issues with the release of the second developer beta a couple weeks ago. At this point it runs just as well as iOS 9 for me.	Yankees1327	t3_4ufwh3
t3_4ufwh3	t1_d5pifvp	1469415586	Working fine here. I get usually one hiccup a day if that. Been using It since latest update and it's working fine. Apples and oranges tho.. Can run fine on some bad on others. Battery life is a tad worse but nothing I need to revert back to 9.3.3 tho. Have also noticed some apps say "not optimized" but still work.  Edit: using a 5s.

t3_4ufwh3	t1_d5pjajh	1469416933	I've been using it. The only issue I am really having is Siri. It tends to freeze up after the "hey siri" or the button press.

t3_4ufwh3	t1_d5po7sa	1469427002	Although they advise you don't install betas for your everyday drivers, iOS 10 Developer beta 3 is extremely functional, for me.

t3_4up1gq	t1_d5rjrty	1469546018	Definitely possible to request desktop sites, though not too sure about uploading. Unfortunately iPhone aren't as plug in and play as android phones when plugged into a computer. You may be able to transfer the movie in some way via iTunes, and it may recognise it in say iMovie but I'm not sure. The only way I can think of is to maybe upload it to the cloud in some way and then download it onto your phone, though that defeats the point really and would take twice as long. Tldr: it may be possible but I couldn't tell you *exactly* how to do it, apologies	Cheeky_Chris	t3_4up1gq
t3_4up1gq	t1_d5rjyeq	1469546257	Safari on the iPhone does allow for a document picker like Documents by readdle, iCloud drive and others. When you tap on upload in safari it will bring up all available document pickers on your iPhone. Getting them on to the device is dependent on the document picker itself. often times its as simple as plugging up to the computer and going to iTunes&gt;apps&gt; and adding it to the app that you are using.

t3_4up1gq	t1_d5rkgrh	1469546900	Yeah, Safari can request desktop sites and if all else fails just download chrome as you can do it there too.  That *might* work. However to stop piracy Apple may have clamped down on that sort of thing but as I say I've never tried so I'm not 100% sure. I mean, you can still put MP3s that you've downloaded onto your phone so i guess movies would be similar?	Cheeky_Chris	t1_d5rk2lk
t3_4up1gq	t1_d5rkzst	1469547565	When I go to the mobile site and request the desktop version, it just refreshes the mobile site.

t3_4up1gq	t1_d5rmhrf	1469549462	I'm not /u/ReliableSource but trying to answer you.  Im uploading a video to YT from Safari on my iPhone. It's a .MOV file.  (Copied it and checked on my computer to double check) Works just fine.   Regarding "how easy is to transfer a .mov file to the iPhone, it is really simple as long as you don't enable iCloud Photo Library; you select a folder to sync the phone with, and every time you connect your phone to your macbook, it'll transfer the data.	m3zelluf	t1_d5rlzjr
t3_4up1gq	t1_d5rmj2t	1469549509	Y'know, YouTube has an upload feature through its app. I don't know about Android, but you can upload it through the app itself. At least on an iPhone	TheBensonBoy	t3_4up1gq
t3_4up1gq	t1_d5rn6rf	1469550346	It's not; I just recorded it from my phone specifically to test the upload page. I'm not near my computer, so I can't say with 100% certainty, but I'm 99.9999% sure you can transfer a .mov file from a desktop to a phone with no problem. If you're using a Mac you can AirDrop the file and it will show up in the camera roll; if you're using Windows you can upload it to a cloud storage service or use a third party app like Documents to put it on the device.

t3_4us6zc	t1_d5seeai	1469584520	Went to the Apple Store a few weeks ago after having this issue for months. Roughly 2 hours and $85 dollar later and my issue was resolved. All the did was replace the battery and I could use my phone as it was just hours before. I'd definitely go this route unless you plan to upgrade in the fall, in which case I'd just get an external battery and stick it out.	roblvb15	t3_4us6zc
t3_4us6zc	t1_d5sem7a	1469584797	I was going to skip this fall's model and wait until the "S" version. TBH the 6 is working well enough for me that I don't feel the need to upgrade.   This thing wont turn on anymore. It's an endless loop of the white screen with the apple logo.	anarchyx34	t1_d5seeai
t3_4us6zc	t1_d5ses9c	1469585020	I'm in the same boat you are on waiting. Also I had the infinite loop as well.

t3_4us6zc	t1_d5sgpua	1469587837	I took my 6 in for this very problem just the other day. They didn't charge me anything to run the diagnostic and they said the battery was just getting old. It was at 85% capacity after 380-ish charge cycles. They offered to replace the battery ($79). I'm on the fence about getting a 7 so I decided to just roll with it and carry a charger around for now.

They're almost guaranteed to replace the battery, and it sounds like your credit card will cover the cost.  You're not going to lose your data. At absolute worst they'd need to do a fresh install then restore from a backup, which doesn't lose any data, it just takes longer.	sobri909	t1_d5sem7a
t3_4us6zc	t1_d5sq9m0	1469608824	My old iPhone 5 (out of warranty) was doing the same thing. I went to the Apple Store and it shut off (at 99%) in the middle of them trying to fix the problem. They did a test and said my battery was in the failing portion and I got it replaced for free because it was hazardous.	jonnyp200	t3_4us6zc
t3_4us6zc	t1_d5sqpup	1469610360	I went into a local third party Apple repair shop today and was quoted 40 bucks on a replacement battery for my 6. So, if anyone reading this is going to replace their battery, call around first.	alexrmay91	t1_d5seeai
t3_4us6zc	t1_d5storb	1469619815	Well I left it on the charger overnight and it came back on and charged to 100%. Did an iTunes backup and I'll try to get to the Apple Store later today.	anarchyx34	t1_d5spzhb
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5su0e6	1469620612	If you read the reviews on the app (called Fingerprint Password), it seems like it also requires a backup passcode. This is probably the part that works on older devices. I'm not spending $2 to test it though.	nathreed	t3_4utsk7

t3_4utsk7	t1_d5sw5q1	1469625034	People already pay for 1Password   Edit: lol got downvotes for this really?   I use 1Password but I essentially use it for everything safari can do. Hold my passwords, hold my usernames and hold my card info. It can even generate passwords if you like those long random passwords.	SomeRandomProducer	t1_d5suf0k
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5sx524	1469626676	"You don't have to **rememeber**"  ... and "your private information always remains **in** your device."  Seems like a great tool.	basthomas	t3_4utsk7
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5sxo4o	1469627493	But 1Password does much more than just store identities\passwords on a single device, ulike this app.	fantasifull	t1_d5sw5q1
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5sxum5	1469627766	To be fair Safari is not limited to one device (iCloud Keychain), but you're not wrong that 1Password is more featureful. I'm a long time 1Password user myself, I particularly like it for storing banking/payment details.	wrboyce	t1_d5sxo4o

t3_4us6zc	t1_d5t38np	1469634904	Make sure you're using the Apple charging cable or an MFI certified one to charge your phone. I purchased a cheap cable at the flea store because I didn't have mine and it would charge the phone but the percentage was off. I sliced and threw it away and I will never use cheap cables again.	Soldier-2Point0	t3_4us6zc
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5t3kc3	1469635296	Yeah it really the best, Most people use maybe 2-3 diffrent passwords over several hundred sites and the browser have them all saved... = Security score 0   With lastpass, I now have a diffrent password for each and every site, and for most of them, I dont even know the password myself, only lastpass knows and its so smooth!	StandardKiwi	t1_d5sxmh2
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5t5sxf	1469638014	Then I would export my database (like I already have) and migrate to another software. I don't see why lastpass would close in the foreseeable future.  Also, this: https://lastpass.com/support.php?cmd=showfaq&amp;id=1376	fantasifull	t1_d5t4zo7
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5t62tc	1469638344	There is nothing wrong with Keepass btw. I've used it in the past, but for me I prefer LastPass as it is a much more feature rich and polished product. I do like that Keepass is open source though.	fantasifull	t1_d5t4zo7
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5t6aki	1469638599	Also lastpass works on phone in a very user friendly way, that's the primary reason for me chiming out 12$	StandardKiwi	t1_d5t62tc
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5t9v8k	1469642812	I wasn't arguing anything against 1Password but the major reason why people look into something like 1Password is for the features Safari currently also has.   They want to save their passwords and be able to have those password on different devices (I understand safari is only Apple)   They want to save credit card info on different devices so they don't have to pull out their wallets constantly.   I know 1Password is worth its price but I'm sure there are a lot of people that purchased it before Safari was able to even do the same.	SomeRandomProducer	t1_d5sxo4o
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5tb33b	1469644248	I've spent about 50 on 1Password so far and I can say that it was totally worth it. Having it on my Mac and IPhone makes it so simple. Having all my password and notes and info all accessible is really nice. I also can download it to my PC when I get one and then all my passwords are there too. I think it is the perfect solution.	1madeamistake	t1_d5t9v8k

t3_4utsk7	t1_d5tgpa9	1469651077	You're fucked if you need passwords from your iCloud Keychain on Windows though.	C02JN1LHDKQ1	t1_d5sxum5
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5tkr42	1469656239	Yeah, practically all my machines run some kind of Apple OS so I'm mostly good, but logging into stuff on my Linux machines (where neither iCloud Keychain nor 1Password are available) can be annoying.	wrboyce	t1_d5tgpa9
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5tn80i	1469659420	But these are the same things iCloud Keychain does.   I mean the working on Windows part is great and all. But not worth money imo when you can use all the note type stuff from iCloud.com	AlexTraner	t1_d5sw5q1
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5tnf9o	1469659666	Love LastPass! I considered KeePass, as I like to dabble in Linux, but the LastPass app is the bomb.	librarygrrl	t1_d5sxmh2
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5to864	1469660677	If you use the shittier/less secure .agilekeychain format, you can open 1Password.html and view a web interface for your 1Password data in any system with a web browser.  It's not ideal, but it does help get by on systems without native support.	C02JN1LHDKQ1	t1_d5tkr42
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5totdk	1469661450	Going off on a bit of a tangent, do you know *why* 1Password uses two different formats; the `cloudkeychain` being much more secure/less shitty. Is it something to do with the JavaScript stuff? It seems very arbitrary to say "if you're using X sync provider we'll use Y file format".  I have some benchmarks on this from a project a while ago:      Hashtype: 1Password, agilekeychain     Workload: 1000 loops, 64 accel      Speed.GPU.#1.:   356.8 kH/s     Speed.GPU.#2.:   357.0 kH/s     Speed.GPU.#3.:   357.0 kH/s     Speed.GPU.#4.:   357.0 kH/s     Speed.GPU.#*.:  1427.9 kH/s      Hashtype: 1Password, cloudkeychain     Workload: 1024 loops, 2 accel      Speed.GPU.#1.:      717 H/s     Speed.GPU.#2.:      718 H/s     Speed.GPU.#3.:      717 H/s     Speed.GPU.#4.:      718 H/s     Speed.GPU.#*.:     2869 H/s	wrboyce	t1_d5to864
t3_4utsk7	t1_d5tp107	1469661730	My understanding was that opvault was just agilekeychain version 2, right? agilekeychain exposed things like the sites URL and title. opvault stops that.  I honestly didn't follow the reasoning behind it.	C02JN1LHDKQ1	t1_d5totdk
t3_4uxipp	t1_d5tps3v	1469662725	IMO, even the 5 is still a decent phone.  It really depends on what you want to do with it.    If you are going to play a lot of CPU-intensive games, then you might want something newer.  If you are just going to use it for texting, phone calls, email, etc., then a 5S would be fine.	strib666	t3_4uxipp
t3_4uxipp	t1_d5tpv24	1469662840	Essentially think about what you're using it for, because the iPhone 5s was launched in Sept 2013 and is made most probably for an era of 2013-2015 maybe 2016.   Hence why it isn't sold in Apple Stores anymore.   It still will be supported by the Genius Bar for a while to come, but, if you're wanting to do crazy amazing things with it then I would think about iPhone 5SE. If you're looking just to make phone calls, text and surf the internet now and then, then 5s should be fine.   Depending on whether you wait or not, the 5s might drop even further in price after the new release or stores might not even stock them anymore, so be careful in your decision there.  tldr; Basically what do you need the phone for and decide whether it's the right phone for you.	agronsky	t3_4uxipp
t3_4uxipp	t1_d5tpxrf	1469662947	How long do you plan on owning this phone? If your answer is more than a year then don't skimp. If you pay for the newer phone you'll get one that will last longer, will have a few more features and will work better over its lifetime. It's more expensive, but it's a much better deal. If you skimp, understand you're locking yourself into something that will be performing subpar until your next phone.  In other words, if you got a 7 in a few months you might use it for 3 years. If you get a 5S, you'll probably use it for a year before having to upgrade again. Maybe you'll spend less on those two old phones combined compared to just one top of the range one, but you'll be spending those 3 years wondering about performance and lack of features.  If you like 4 inch screens, get the SE (best deal in iPhones right now) if that's too small get at least the 6.	jtory	t3_4uxipp
t3_4uxipp	t1_d5tq3uq	1469663180	Depending on the storage size, carrier, condition, etc. $150 is either a pretty good price or an amazing price for an [iPhone 5S](https://www.getorchard.com/us/iphone-5s-for-sale/). I feel like the obvious choice is buy the iPhone 5S now and you can still sell the phone after and use that money towards an upgrade.	btorchard	t3_4uxipp
t3_4uxipp	t1_d5trivf	1469665174	I would absolutely go for the SE.   That said, the 5s is still pretty damn good.	DragonTamerMCT	t1_d5tovw4
t3_4uxipp	t1_d5u43oz	1469685890	I'm using the 5 and i'm still lovin' it!	s46n64	t3_4uxipp
t3_4uxipp	t1_d5u4gae	1469686732	Yes definitely. In fact I would preffer iphone 5S against SE , since the price difference its almost 2 times and you can get 32gb version of 5s, while in SE you are forced to go for 64gb which costs way to much for what it offers.	Rubikh	t3_4uxipp

t3_4us6zc	t1_d5uljfe	1469722529	Just did that last night. Today I ran it down to 20% ,and then it suddenly jumped to 1%. I plugged it in, and less than a minute later it was at 22%. Still buggered it seems.	anarchyx34	t1_d5sv8fx
t3_4uxipp	t1_d5uo46x	1469725637	The SE is a good option. Apple will let you make payments on it, too and I don't believe there's any interest. The 5S is a good phone, but I'd be wary on making an investment in a 3 year phone. Apple has a good reputation in supporting their devices, but another year or so it'll at least be a lot slower.	jackmusick	t3_4uxipp
t3_4meu4t	t1_d5wd3a6	1469823976	I've just seen this post, so sorry for responding to a comment this old, but I really recommend Horizon 3 calendar. I find it's designed really well!	aidapng	t1_d3v3otv
t3_4uxipp	t1_d5x11dr	1469873330	It's $399 brand new and is superior in almost every aspect. I mean, the battery life alone should be an indicator. You can't even get the 5s brand new anymore I don't think.	Dom9360	t1_d5u4gae
t3_4uxipp	t1_d5x1bk9	1469874427	Yes it is brand new with 16 gb, considering it records 4K you cant get more than few minutes of the video. 16GB iphone should have been dead in 2014 and they kept it even on 2015. Of course it is better but the price difference doesnt justift itself. The front Camera is same, and back camera not "as major" upgrade. You still have no 3d Touch and identical Design. You have better performance but most users wont even see the difference in performance atleast for few more updates.	Rubikh	t1_d5x11dr
t3_4uxipp	t1_d5x1q24	1469875973	I don't think most people care about recording in 4K, especially a guy who is pondering a $150 phone. The battery alone would make me choose that option especially as the 5S is older and you can't buy it brand new from Apple. It is essentially a 6S without the 3D Touch which is very well noticeable, at least for me. And, yes you can spot the difference between a 5S and SE camera. Finally Apple Pay would be a big miss for me. The 16gb I can see that and they must stop offering that but it works for people -- that's a topic in itself.	Dom9360	t1_d5x1bk9
t3_4uxipp	t1_d5x3wxs	1469883097	iPhone 6s has a premium quality glass in front(maybe because of laminated display), it looks better and it has actually better touch quality. Iphone SE has identical iphone 5 screen (I still use my iphone 5). Besides the front camera (as I said before) is still 1.2mpx which is ridiculous and makes no sense at all. Honestly I am an iphone 5 user and I would never update to SE, if budget is concern I would go for 5s and i strongly believe that iPhone 5s has bargain for its price. Although my next update would probably be iPhone 6s	Rubikh	t1_d5x1q24

t3_4vca42	t1_d5x7f3o	1469890812	I'd say you'd probably be good for another year with a 5S, but it would be smart after that to at least pick up a 6. And if you're concerned about the size, the SE is the same size as 5S, but runs as smoothly as the 6S.	brettgoespunk	t3_4vca42
t3_4vca42	t1_d5x7ns9	1469891269	You are looking at another 2 years probably of it being in good use before it starts to decline. People I know still have a 5 without any major issue, shit I was going to keep the 5s for a bit longer if Apple didn't release the SE.   Good deal too, it will be serviceable.	plyboult	t3_4vca42

It seems like the battery isn't as good as it once was, but it is still much better than my old Galaxy S5. The only worry I have other than that is how it will react to iOS 10 in the fall. With all of this said, I'd still recommend it.	mm294	t3_4vca42

t3_4vca42	t1_d5xi9am	1469908879	I recently picked up a 5S - I needed a new phone, have become gradually less impressed with Android, and wanted to try an iPhone for the first time. I haven't jammed it full of random (cr)apps, nor do I intend to, wouldn't consider myself a demanding user. Calls, SMS / IM, email, a bit of news, reddit, the odd podcast and such.  Since you mention email it's worth knowing that the iOS built-in mail client doesn't do push notification with Gmail or any IMAP server I pointed it at. Options include installing a specific app (Gmail, Outlook, etc) per account, redirecting your mail to iCloud (which does do push) or what I did - not being that bothered and settling for 15-minute checks.  My advice is do it. I have no regrets. The only time it's not buttery smooth is within the first minute of firing it up. Form factor is exactly right, feels like quality, battery lasts forever, Touch ID is great. Camera isn't fantastic quality but it is very responsive.  If you don't get on with it, you can always throw it on eBay for exactly what you paid for it and go get a Nexus or something. That was my plan B but I'm sticking with the iPhone. Hope this helps :)	CptCmdrAwesome	t3_4vca42

t3_4vca42	t1_d5xnnrx	1469917917	Oh yes. It is. I think the only apps that may hitch on it, are the most intense games. But I think all the best AAA titles run fine. I think 2-3 more years it'll finally start slowing down. But iOS 10 runs great on it.	Hailtothething	t3_4vca42

t3_4vca42	t1_d5y4jqu	1469953030	In the past month I've had a Xiaomi Mi4C, a Lumia 950 and am now on a slightly used 5S. The Xiaomi and the Lumia are absolute beasts, but the Lumia is cursed with WinMobile, the Xiaomi is the best of the three, it's a dream phone, but I have to say that the 5S is the sweet spot. Excellent form and build quality, absolutely gorgeous, and for what I do it serves me fine (I use phones strictly as communication/productivity tools). I'm on ios 10 public beta and battery life is better than 9.3.3. Yesterday from 9am to around 4pm the phone stayed at 93% (albeit with very minimal use,just a text and an email, also low power mode enabled). This is in a used battery at 84% capacity. Phone is always smooth, no lags, I am happy and will keep it until it breaks, and I will seriously consider the 2017 iPhone then.   TLDR: former iPhone hater, the 5S converted me.

t3_4vj25q	t1_d5yrrrf	1470000042	I bought a SS Apple Watch when it came out, and I returned it 2 weeks later. Wasn't a huge fan of it but I could definitely see the potential it had.	HenMeister	t3_4vj25q
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5yrwrg	1470000261	I have one was bought for a gift I've been with out it  now 5 days and Man I had no idea how much I used it I've been lost	McNuttyNutz	t3_4vj25q
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5yryrb	1470000345	Haha. What were your primary uses for the watch.	Prius_For_Life	t1_d5yrwrg
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5ysdij	1470000982	I got my SS when it was released and have been using it daily. Notifications (edited, so only the most importantly ones come through), health and exercise tracking. Telling time...  Reminders of upcoming appointments and to do items.  I didn't expect to use it so much! I don't use any third party apps.	WalkThat	t3_4vj25q
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5yt5nf	1470002174	Like some others I had one and returned it. It was way overpriced for its capabilities. I now have a Pebble Time and really enjoy it.	catchesbass	t3_4vj25q
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5yumfv	1470004448	Perfectly. You can reply via voice or canned responses that you program in the Pebble app	catchesbass	t1_d5yujpv
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5yuq4c	1470004611	It's possible to have all notifications forwarded to the watch and have it only vibrate, right? How's the vibration motor?	limelight22	t1_d5yumfv
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5yv8hv	1470005424	Yep. The vibration motor is strong enough that I keep my iPhone muted at all times. It's better than I ever expected.	catchesbass	t1_d5yuq4c
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5yvc08	1470005581	Pretty great. I just wish there was an easy way to trade my Apple Watch for a pebble time round…	limelight22	t1_d5yv8hv
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5yvxjw	1470006565	The round doesn't have the battery of the standard Time. But it's more stylish.	catchesbass	t1_d5yvc08
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5yvznd	1470006660	Yeah that's why I want it, the Apple Watch battery suits me fine, and it's much worse than the Round's battery. It just looks so great.	limelight22	t1_d5yvxjw
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5ywrez	1470007920	I got my AW sport last August, and basically use it everyday. The main uses are to tell time (don't have to pull out my iPhone), get weather alerts via Dark Sky, and scan text messages when I receive them.   I have recently skipped wearing my watch some days, so it certainly has lost its luster since I got it last year. With that said, I most likely will not get the AW2 when it's released.	n1ck1982	t3_4vj25q
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5ywryo	1470007946	I have had mine for a whole now, I personally think the apps suck and never use any of them. Super slow and very very limited.   I use it to manage notifications, voice dictate replays, set reminders/alarms.   I really enjoy the fitness tracking/step counting/sleep tracking features though.	LobaltSS	t3_4vj25q
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5ywxvb	1470008224	I have a sport and I liked it. With watchOS 3, it breathed a whole new life to it. Runs better, able to do more.	djstarion	t3_4vj25q
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5z0dpu	1470013902	I've had my 42mm sport since early in the year, Jan or Feb (can't remember). At first I thought it was largely redundant and unnecessary, but I've grown to love it. I've worn it every day since I got it and at this point I'd be pretty disappointed if I had to go back to a regular watch. My main uses are the weather app, managing notifications, and the fitness tracker. Before I got the Apple Watch I never really cared about things like the fitness tracker, but it's become something I challenge myself to complete every day. If nothing else it has changed my life in a positive way because of that. I hope this one will last until the AW3 at least, but I will upgrade whenever I feel like the hardware update is significant enough to justify the cost.   You should definitely check out r/AppleWatch. It's not always the most active sub, but the people are really cool there in my experience.	gorehammer84	t3_4vj25q
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5z6rem	1470024480	SG sport owner. Bought it the day I got my post brain surgery for epilepsy MRI. When I drove myself from southern WV to Pittsburgh to get said MRI done I thought it would be a good gift to myself. Since then I've used it for work and for health.    I work in tv news and time is everything. When I need to pay attention on the quickness instead of being awkward and looking around the room to check a clock. I can multitask and just glance at my wrist when I'm using a certain face.  I wouldn't recommend Mickey or a really minimalist face for something time sensitive. But you can do that when you need.   The cool thing is the bands. I've gotten into collecting them and swapping them for different occasions. Have one for more formal events and a couple I just trade out when I feel like it.   The weather apps are awesome. Period. End if story.   The notifications are cool and you can make it do what you want I mean. If you want all your texts. Cool. Emails done. Any app that has a watch app and sends push alerts. cool. My old tv station did. And Everytime they sent a push alert about a big local story or a road closure due to a massive wreck. Bam. On my watchface   I've gotten kinda addicted to it. As a matter of fact as I type this I visited my parents to help my father with something tomorrow and the job requires a lot of manual labor. So much so that it's kinda Meh. May as well just leave it at my place.	sigtaugod	t3_4vj25q
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5z6ryl	1470024507	I own the iPhone SE and have an AWS. I use my watch every day and love it's numerous capabilities. With no planned release of the SE until next year, I plan on upgrading to the AW2.	swedenboi6	t3_4vj25q
t3_4vj25q	t1_d5z97rh	1470029301	I just got one some days ago only for motivating myself for training more since it's nice with a pulse meter and the synergy with the health app and activities app which I hope will get improved. Could probably work with some kind of Fitbit as well. Other than health reasons and see who are dialing to your phone, the watch isn't really worth it imo.	iakt	t3_4vj25q
t3_4vkx92	t1_d5zdxau	1470042508	It may be a connection problem rather than a problem with your iPhone. You could try turning on airplane mode for about 10 seconds, then turning it off. If you still have issues, try rebooting your phone. If the probably persists, it may be your wifi or router that's causing the issue. Hope that helps !	Jackie-Nirvana	t3_4vkx92
t3_4ruo6s	t1_d5zgcjf	1470050321	Due all the way! Definitely the king of the short-term reminder/task-nag apps on iOS. It's highly focused on that one core feature, so might not have things like email integration (though there's a companion mac app that might provide some sort of syncing). Honestly I use this app way more than any of the fancier (and more expensive) productivity apps I've bought.	Stupidideas	t1_d5ldkhi
t3_4vkx92	t1_d5zggwv	1470050669	Try this and see if it helps: Reset network settings (settings, general, reset)  Disable wifi assist (under settings and cellular at the bottom of the screen) Test it for a bit see if it helped.  If not try this also: Go to wifi and change your DNS. [I have mine set to Google 8.8.8.8](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/)  Good luck.	Amdiron	t3_4vkx92
t3_4vkx92	t1_d5zh621	1470052550	You don't happen to have Wi-Fi Assist turned on do you?   Wi-Fi Assist drops Wi-Fi in favour of mobile data when the mobile data connection is stronger/faster.   Go to &gt; Settings &gt; Mobile Data &gt; Scroll to the bottom and turn off Wi-Fi Assist	adamhuxley	t3_4vkx92
t3_4vkx92	t1_d5zmki1	1470062329	This exact thing happens to my 6 constantly. Soooo annoying. My Mac is fine though and so is my smart tv so I don't think it's my wifi connection. Wifi assist is off. No idea what is causing it.	coldjeanz	t3_4vkx92
t3_4ruo6s	t1_d5zyno2	1470078090	Pretty much late for me. Left Dota 2 or say gaming long back for good. Anyway best of luck. Go Ferrari 430	nishant28491	t1_d5gk93e
t3_4us6zc	t1_d601ldh	1470081690	Apple's diagnostic is reading the same thing that Coconutbattery does. It's only the information self-reported by the battery itself. If *that* info is incorrect then you have a bad battery reporting itself as healthy.	anarchyx34	t1_d5sj5r2
t3_4us6zc	t1_d601mx4	1470081743	Ended up having the battery replaced at a 3rd party shop after the Apple Store insisted there was nothing wrong with the battery. Works good as new now.	anarchyx34	t1_d5seeai
t3_4voi04	t3_4voi04	1470081990	6/6s and 6/6s Plus owners, what is your biggest regret with choosing the size you did?	MerrickGreen	-1
t3_4voi04	t1_d6027ov	1470082433	I went from a 5s to a 6s Plus and I don't regret it at all. Love the battery life, love the size, and I can still use the phone one-handed (although I use Reachability a lot). I thought I was going to be giving up a lot of one-handed use when getting the Plus, but it turned out not to be the case for me.	ReliableSource	t3_4voi04
t3_4voi04	t1_d602c5u	1470082580	I've had my 6+ for almost two years, and have loved it the whole time. However, its size is finally starting to cause problems. I hold it with my pinky on the bottom side of the phone (by the lightning port) with my pinky supporting some of the weight of the phone. Doing this for such a long time has started to cause pain in my hand even when I'm not holding the phone.	Telynor	t3_4voi04
t3_4voi04	t1_d602fqb	1470082701	I do that a lot with my current phone, especially when using the selfie cam. It can make the phone a bit difficult to control, and it's hard to get a clear shot without motion blur.	MerrickGreen	t1_d602c5u
t3_4voi04	t1_d602l3q	1470082883	I have a 6plus and I don't regret it at all. When I bought it a week after release everybody said "so big, so dumb". But now most of them say "I wish I had a bigger screen for ___".   The size bothers me in my pocket when I go to the gym, or sitting down in the car because it slides out of my pocket. But those are the only downsides for me.	x9a	t3_4voi04
t3_4voi04	t1_d602ntp	1470082978	That i didn't get the 1200$ back i paid for the 6S. I sold it for 550$ ._.	Blubbll	t3_4voi04
t3_4voi04	t1_d602vn2	1470083247	6s here, no regrets. I occasionally wander into an Apple Store and I'll pick up a 6s+ and each time, I'm glad I have the smaller size	burlow44	t3_4voi04
t3_4voi04	t1_d603rih	1470084339	Basically, if Apple had made the 6s as thick as the camera bump and used that space to give it a decent battery, I'd jump on it.	MerrickGreen	t1_d602vn2
t3_4voi04	t1_d604a5e	1470084990	I went from the 6 to the 6S Plus and now I'm testing out the SE. The Plus was way too big. My hands actually got tired from holding it. Spec-wise, the Plus doesn't measure out to be a lot bigger than the 6, but when you pair the size and weight with how I hold my phone (from the bottom, with pinkies supporting the base), it was unyielding. I kept almost dropping it (and it was also impossible to take selfies with one hand). The Plus was just bad ergonomics for me.   My 6 has commendable battery for me because I am a light mobile medial consumer. It makes it through the day with light usage. I usually charge at night or the next morning. It was a good phone (I still have it but I'm testing out the SE).	mmaireenehc	t3_4voi04
t3_4voi04	t1_d604dlo	1470085108	Same here on the pinky pain. I just got a loopy case last week and it's been great in that respect.	vkoser	t1_d602c5u

t3_4voi04	t1_d606934	1470087555	i only wish it was smaller sometimes when putting it in my pocket. mine is in a lifeproof fre case. battery life is great though.	defjamblaster	t3_4voi04
t3_4voi04	t1_d606pxj	1470088196	I originally chose the 6s, but traded somebody for the 6s plus and I couldn't be happier. The bigger size and weight haven't caused me any problems yet.	Ryr45	t3_4voi04
t3_4voi04	t1_d609wh0	1470092773	I had a 6 prior. It's fantastic, actually. It's noticeably snappier than the 6. The battery is amazing. The small size threw me off initially but after a while, it's kinda like being reunited with an old friend. Also swipe typing with Gboard using one hand is really ace.	mmaireenehc	t1_d604grx
t3_4voi04	t1_d60adeu	1470093471	I have a 6s and currently thinking about selling it and getting the 6s plus.	Jamesxxxiii	t3_4voi04
t3_4voi04	t1_d60bys9	1470095832	Pinkie injury is one of the major factors for me going from the 6 (non-plus) down to an SE.   Other reason not being able to reach all the screen one-handed without having to shuffle the phone up/down in my hand.	byerss	t1_d602c5u
t3_4vkx92	t1_d60ca7q	1470096307	I don't know man the way you described it is the same exact thing that is happening to me. The loading symbol will be there next to the wifi icon, and when I slide up control panel to disable and then enable wifi it will start working again. I have a hard time believing my router is the problem when no other device is having issues.	coldjeanz	t1_d605sdi
t3_4voi04	t1_d60cb4g	1470096343	I went from the 5 to the 6 and then back to the SE.  6 had a nice screen, and the size was appreciated for its roominess, but was unappreciated because it was too big to use one-handed.  Having to hit a UI element on the top of the screen, and then subsequently on the bottom resulted in the on handed "phone shuffle". I couldn't stand it anymore so I went down to an SE.  SE is definitely preferred for its compact size, but I do sometimes miss the bigger screen... until I have to actually handle a large phone again.	byerss	t3_4voi04
t3_4vkx92	t1_d60d25i	1470097385	Yeah my wife's phone and all of our other devices run perfect. I'm starting to think I might just have to live with this issue. Good luck getting things fixed on your end.	ADontHaveAnAttitude	t1_d60ca7q

t3_4voi04	t1_d619j9f	1470158759	So rounding out the responses so far, we have   10 + owners, most of whom are happy but a few of whom have complained about the size.  4 standard size owners, one of whom would like to move to the +.  2 SE owners who were not happy with the larger phones.  The results seem to suggest that, by and large, + owners find the compromises of owning such a large phone worthwhile. Overall, though, most people seem to be happy with their iPhone, whatever the size. Personally, I'm leaning towards the Plus and just hoping that I can bear to keep using my phone until the 7 is available.  Thanks, everyone, and feel free to keep posting your experience. I'll edit this comment as needed to keep it up to date.	MerrickGreen	t3_4voi04

t3_4xhfen	t1_d6frtn5	1471087743	The best thing is just sign up for iCloud space. $0.99 a month for 50gb or $2.99 for 200gb. Your phone will then store your photos in the cloud, but leave the most recent on your phone with just previews of the others. It will also fluctuate how much is stored on your phone depending on how much space you have on the phone, and the rest you still see in your photos they will just take a second to load in when you click them. Its the easiest and most fluid.  I also just back them up on to my computer to have a non-cloud backup every year or two.	ryancarty	t3_4xhfen
t3_4xhfen	t1_d6ft56j	1471091864	I use the free option because I don't mind much that the quality of the photo or video is reduced by a little bit. Just using it for it's unlimited space :)	Zero_2410	t1_d6fsaxb
t3_4xhfen	t1_d6ft9zz	1471092238	That is definitely looking like a great option! Two questions, if you don't mind. Do you auto-upload on the go or do you use an app like PhotoSync to upload only over WiFi? Additionally, I read that Google Photos will not prevent you from uploading duplicates. Have you ever had a problem with that?  Thanks for the help!	thegraverobber	t1_d6ft56j
t3_4xhfen	t1_d6ftqar	1471093430	I have it set to auto-upload when I'm connected over WiFi.  There can be times that there will be a duplicate but it's on the rare occasion for me. At times I really don't mind since the space is unlimited.	Zero_2410	t1_d6ft9zz
t3_4xhfen	t1_d6gomb8	1471146109	I didn't realize the Apple option was so affordable, wow. Do you know whether photos that you have saved to the phone will sync seamlessly to your new phone when you upgrade?	HAVE-A-CHOCOLATE	t1_d6frtn5
t3_4xhfen	t1_d6gq3on	1471148918	The 1TB is useless for mass uploading though since many vital features of the service are premium users only. So no drag and drop and only a certain amount of photo uploads at a time. Went downhill as soon as Yahoo bought them for the delicious photo archive gold mine	frayeb	t1_d6fmro9
t3_4xhfen	t1_d6gqjg9	1471149812	Yeah, so I have the 200gb option so it stores my photos, the other stuff in the iCloud settings tab, and I backup to iCloud now instead of syncing and backing up to a computer (partly for convenience and partly because the backups were taking up like 30+gb on my computer).  So when I get the iPhone 7 for example and I get to the Hello screen in the beginning, I'll choose restore from iCloud backup and just let it run and everything including my photos will sync over. (Although like i said i usually back up my photos to an external hard drive anyway to be safe). Your photos can also be accessed from iCloud.com, and your Mac and other devices (if certain settings are on).  TL;DR: Hell yeah	ryancarty	t1_d6gomb8

t3_4xn6ol	t1_d6gxn3b	1471171698	I'd argue more that any modern camera can take great photos when you have an eye for composition, lighting and interesting subjects. Your major limits with phone cameras are low lighting situations and just how big you intend to view it at a reasonably close distance. Obviously I prefer my full frame 5D mk ii, but it's nice having a passable camera for any nice photo opportunity always in your pocket. And no photo from any camera isn't first going through photoshop or Lightroom etc. before you get to see it online or printed somewhere. Post processing is as old as photophraphy itself. It will always be the eye of the photographer that takes the noteworthy photo, not the camera. And sure, any one of these photos would turn out better with a dedicated camera, but they might not have been taken at all if that person didn't want to lug a dedicated camera along with them.

t3_4xn6ol	t1_d6gzozz	1471178708	Subtle? You can tell all Lightroom adjustment to each image. Wether be black and white, sharpness, color gradients and color adjustments. iPhone pictures are way too washed out to render such bokeh and color rendition without the aid of a computer.  They are great images and composition are good, but are heavily edited. Just like pictures from dslr are.	mastaa	t1_d6gy51e

t3_4y9o23	t1_d6m5oa7	1471491275	Even if your phone is locked to a company, it should work fine with the Canadian counterpart. For example, my phone is with Rogers and when I go to the United States, it is with Verizon. Maybe you can get a SIM card from the Canadian equivalent of your company? I might be wrong, but it's worth checking out.   Also, your company might not unlock it, but there's a lot of cellular stores that might be able to do it. I know lots of people that got it done here (in Canada). You should find if that's possible.	Sirenallure	t3_4y9o23

t3_4y9s6v	t1_d6m9mf5	1471499120	Samsung uses AMOLED which has burn in you have a static image on screen for a long time, Apple uses IPS which doesn't have as punchy/vibrant colors and it can't turn off black pixels but it's cheaper (only Samsung makes AMOLED) and doesn't have burn in.

t3_4y9s6v	t1_d6mbtx4	1471504952	Thats rubbish, i have a 5k Retina 27" iMac and if i have my brightness on the lowest setting for too long the image will burn into the display. theres an Apple support page on this which tells you to put the screensaver on for a while.  This is an IPS LCD display :)	marcuscarpenter1992	t1_d6m7jir
t3_4y9s6v	t1_d6mehkl	1471513901	Okay, weird. I thought this was just my screen doing this. [here](https://vid.me/SKo5) is a video showing how much it fluctuates. I had not noticed until reading this thread how much it varies based on what is on the screen. As per the video it comes and goes with brightness and Night Shift.  I do not believe it is a software glitch as I first noticed this (thinking it was colour bleed on a defective screen) on iOS 9 as well.  * iPhone 6S Plus 128gb Model  * iOS 10 Beta 6  I'm personally holding off on sending it in for repair/replacement as without an Apple Store in NZ it takes 5+ days and I'm due for an upgrade when the 7 Plus comes out anyway.	nomadicalnz	t3_4y9s6v

t3_4y9s6v	t1_d6mxgoi	1471544371	I'm sorry this happened to you, but try apples customer service. They should replace it for you as its a defect. Either way, it's not burn in.	atman8r	t1_d6m88lw
t3_4y9s6v	t1_d6mxjcz	1471544459	No, you don't. Burn in happens on AMOLED displays only, because AMOLED displays only power on the pixels that are showing color. So it will "burn" the image into the display, and create a ghost image on the screen. This doesn't happen on IPS LCD because if one part of an LCD screen is on, ALL of the screen is on.	atman8r	t1_d6mbtx4
t3_4y9s6v	t1_d6n3zbb	1471552188	I have the same issue on my iPhone 6 Plus 64 GB. Except mine is on the top right side of my screen. Most notable when night shift is switched on or when I bring up the control center.	DeadObjects	t3_4y9s6v

t3_4y9s6v	t1_d6nh9um	1471570730	Ok what part of that was proving me wrong exactly? Any screen will ghost if you leave it on one single image for longggggg periods of time. But it WILL go away after a short period of time off of that image. Unlike AMOLED, which will NOT go away once it's there.	atman8r	t1_d6n8aje

I need to unlock my phone, but you guys won't let me do that while my phone is under contract.  "I seem to have two options. I pay out the next four months of my bill, for a total of X dollars paid to you, and then get my phone unlocked and cancel my service.  "Or, I can pay you significantly more money to cancel my service right now, and that's ridiculous. The remainder of the contract should not be a lower price than the early termination fee, and any sane person would agree with me.  "So please, whatever you have to do, let me buy out the rest of my contract right now and unlock my phone, rather than literally penalizing me for being an ideal customer by crippling my phone for four months as the only alternative to paying an absurd fee that clearly is neither intended nor appropriate to apply to people in my situation."  I've been in this situation before—it was $150 to cancel and like $70 to wait it out, and that was ridiculous. I had to be transferred a couple of times but eventually someone was able to do what I wanted.	RulerOf	t1_d6m863q

t3_4ymbhu	t1_d6otuvc	1471654631	It's just a few weeks before Apple should announce and release the i7. There's not much point in jumping the gun unless you're already strongly in the Android/Galaxy camp.  You could have my own predicament- get an i7 or hold out months on end to see what the s8 has in store.	my02	t3_4ymbhu
t3_4ymbhu	t1_d6ovkuf	1471657373	Hey there! I'm in the same position, I've owned several android phones but since the 5 I've owned iPhones. Currently on a 6 plus I got preorder about  2 years ago. Anyways, I was excited for the redesign seeing as how apples alwAys done there major refresh in a two year cycle. However, the leaks show that the new iPhone is essentially the same as my current phone, albeit with a few more features but lack of a headphone jack. With android devices shipping with 4K screens, quick charge, wireless charging, expandable memory, and 2-3x more ram, it's really a no brainer for me to make the jump. My friends note 4 that came out in 2014 absolutely blows my retina screen away. It seems apple's simply relying on brand whores to make as much as they can using 3 year old technology in their smartphones. The note 7 is a gorgeous phone that has everything you could ever want in a phone really. Also, not sure if you've tried VR but it's extremely cool and android nougat is building in an entire marketplace/VR mode into the firmware. Meanwhile, iPhones getting ios10 which is seemingly pretty similar to the last 3 or 4 ios versions. iMessage got cooler, they took off swipe to unlock, and you can delete stock apps. That's about it. I'm really hoping apple comes back next year and gives me a reason to go back to iPhone, but for sure my next phone will be a flagship android. I love the note 7, however I'm waiting to see what the nexus sailfish is like (successor to the 6P) because they've always been $2-300 cheaper than other flagships and look/feel/function amazingly. I'm also considering the one plus 3 for the same reasons. That phone is gorgeous and $400 for a 6gb snapdragon 820 smartphone.	The_Nox	t3_4ymbhu
t3_4ymbhu	t1_d6ox9qn	1471660181	Just wait a month, its not that hard.	AGIANTSMURF	t3_4ymbhu
t3_4ymbhu	t1_d6ozlyf	1471664252	I'd say the reason you shouldn't leave iPhone and go to android again is because you were clearly not satisfied with android when you did. You went through all the iPhones until 5 and when you went to android, you got phone after phone.	Sirenallure	t3_4ymbhu
t3_4ymbhu	t1_d6p1ib6	1471667819	The only thing I could think of is TouchWiz. When I had it was really annoying, and no matter how high of specs Samsung slapped on their phone there was always this annoying lag. There's also the fact that your phone likely won't be reveling updates after 3-4 years, as software updates have to be approved by Samsung and then your carrier, which I guess makes you more vulnerable to security issues. And then there's always the learning curve...because when I had one of those phones figuring out something as simple as finding the flashlight or turning off synching for mail required me googling it. And then sometimes you accidentally trigger one of the "features" they crammed in there and then you gotta search to figure out how to turn it off.   This was with a Galaxy s5 I dunno if they fixed all of this.	Chocolate_Hamper	t3_4ymbhu
t3_4ymbhu	t1_d6p2d2f	1471669590	They fixed the touch wiz problem. Updates are pretty fast in the states but other countries can be questionable. The biggest learning curve for me is how the capacitative buttons are placed.	Baekmagoji	t1_d6p1ib6
t3_4ymbhu	t1_d6p2qqa	1471670421	I was in a similar situation when the 6 was released back in 2014. I really didn't like the phone and I thought it would be a good time for a change. So, I tried android in the form of a LG G3. Once the novelty had worn off I had that sinking buyers remorse that you mention. I missed imessage and the integration with my other apple products, but most of all I missed the familiarity that came with having been with the same OS for six years.   My rational mind tells me that if I jump and try the note - which honestly looks like the best phone I have ever seen - I will probably end up regretting it for the same reasons as before. I would agree that Apple seem to be falling behind. There are elements of both their hardware and software design philosophy that annoy the shit out of me. Moving to android would address that. I've spent some time with an S7 recently and that has raised my interest. The note 7 has raised it again to another level but I am going to wait to see what the iPhone 7 brings.	dfuqt	t3_4ymbhu
t3_4ymbhu	t1_d6p3m8n	1471672439	You can easily replace TouchWiz with the download of another launcher. When I had an S3 I downloaded Nova Launcher and it worked amazing. It gave me the scrolling background that the stock launcher didn't have.   Sure, it's a pain to download another app but if the only thing holding you back from switching to Android is TouchWiz that can easily be fixed.	Skunkman2011	t1_d6p1ib6
t3_4ymbhu	t1_d6p4vee	1471675765	Ah. Don't launchers kinda mess with your battery life?   Edit: I googled it and it turns out launchers shouldn't drain your battery unless it's a shitty one.	Chocolate_Hamper	t1_d6p3m8n
t3_4ymbhu	t1_d6p4yg9	1471676007	Oh I absolutely am waiting until the iPhone comes out to decide - but I will still be in the same boat - unless apple really comes out with something amazing, but I am not holding my breath. So I either go with the best hardware and suck it up when it comes to the potentially janky software or I go for what is more responsive and a bit more polished software but with hardware that is essentially 2 years behind.	Deadmine	t1_d6ox9qn
t3_4ymbhu	t1_d6p50a8	1471676156	yeah - the note really looks like the perfect device at this stage - but a little voice keeps telling me I thought the same with the note 2, s5 and G4 (The nexus I knew the camera wasnt gonna be great but didnt realise until i had it how bad). I will continue to read all the anecdotal stuff coming from people who bought the note and see how janky the software is and if the camera is good for moving subjects etc. thanks!	Deadmine	t1_d6p2qqa
t3_4ymbhu	t1_d6p513u	1471676223	yeah it might come down to this in the end. My head is telling me the note is probably the better device but my heart is telling me I will be happier back in the iphone ecosystem...	Deadmine	t1_d6ozlyf
t3_4ymbhu	t1_d6p5o4h	1471678076	Touchwiz is the whole skin not just the launcher, and the launcher is smooth, its the rest of the ui that lags and you cant do anything about it	kankaswag	t1_d6p3m8n

t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p869w	1471686801	It's pointless for you. No widgets, no direct downloads. It'll be pretty much a downgrade for you if you're used to freedom to do whatever you want on android.	FailedPotatoSeed	t3_4yo96v

t3_4yobli	t1_d6p8cjl	1471687459	Hey, using my 6S since launch day here in germany.  First: Best phone that I have used so far.  Came from an HTC One M8 and boy I could not be happier.  Battery lasts me from 7am to 11pm, so thats fine for me (brightness on 50% plus minus)  I am currently on the latests iOS 9 build, don´t know the exact build number, and it runs buttery smooth. But from what I have seen, iOS 10 runs even smoother.  Yes, I would totally recommend the phone, it´s a beast.	rib124	t3_4yobli
t3_4yobli	t1_d6p8ore	1471688726	Still love it. The battery last for a very long time, and it charges incredibly fast.	ithekiller	t3_4yobli
t3_4yobli	t1_d6p8q3y	1471688868	that´s what I noticed too. Since the capacity is relatively small, it charges sooo fast to 80% and thats totally enough for several hours of usage.	rib124	t1_d6p8ore
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p8yyj	1471689780	It will be very different. You can still direct download PDF, but not sure there is a way to do torrents without jailbreaking (I don't do them so never looked into it).  If you are open minded you will be ok after a short transition. If you are one of those people that don't like change it will be a struggle.	cliffr39	t3_4yo96v
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p93cy	1471690220	For best battery life I'd suggest getting the plus version, you won't be disappointed. You can have a weather widget in the notification center, accessible from anywhere. For music controls and flashlight it's just a matter of swiping up the control center, again accessible from anywhere. All the apps you listed are available and excellent on ios, except for the Reddit and podcasts ones. But there are a few good alternatives. For PDFs you can simply click the "open in iBooks" prompt when you've opened one, and it will automatically download and be available from there. Sorry I don't know about torrents.	mayaisme	t3_4yo96v
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p93pw	1471690255	I mean I'd be open minded to not having those available. Is there nothing similar available? I don't really keep up with the iOS/iPhone stuff so I'm not even really sure what's out there, which is why I posted here. Thanks for the reply!	swskeptic	t1_d6p869w
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p94k8	1471690341	Well I'm definitely open minded to switching over. Downloading files directly isn't something I do every single day, especially with torrents,  so I can live without that I suppose.	swskeptic	t1_d6p8yyj
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p959x	1471690410	Wow thanks, this is exactly the kind of info I was looking for! What about music management? I hear a lot of negativity about iTunes, especially on Windows... Is it really that bad?	swskeptic	t1_d6p93cy
t3_4yobli	t1_d6p963i	1471690492	i've had mine since launch and i can say at least for me, i'm sick of the size. I miss the 5s form so i'm switching to an SE asap. Besides that, everythings so smooth and battery is pretty great!	bonax	t3_4yobli
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p97i7	1471690633	I also use iTunes on Windows. Yes, it's tedious, but it works. It's just not something you'll want to use everyday	mayaisme	t1_d6p959x
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p9aoz	1471690947	You can have a weather widget in the notification center. Torrenting and widgets on your homescreen/lockscreen are only possible with a jailbreak. And since the 7 will ship with iOS 10 it will be a while before a jailbreak comes out.	hweng	t1_d6p93pw
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p9buj	1471691060	Ideally I wouldn't. Currently I have all of my music uploaded to Google Music and just stream it from there, however I find it incredibly buggy when trying to upload new music.  Is there an option like that for iTunes/iPhone?	swskeptic	t1_d6p97i7
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p9c59	1471691088	That's okay, I can wait. The torrents thing is like... bottom of the list of things I care about being able to do.	swskeptic	t1_d6p9aoz
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p9clq	1471691131	I've been using android for the past 7 years, and I was on the same boat as you about 2 months ago.   The thing that kept me away from iOS was not able to have the freedom to download anything from the net like I did with android, until I went ahead and did some research and found an app called Documents 5, which brings this functionality to iOS. So basically you get that functionality to download documents from the net again.   Torrenting is impossible on iOS without jailbreak, but I've never torrented on my android either, since I prefer to torrent on the pc instead.  Reddit? Most apps are being killed off the App Store, so your best option for a Reddit app is the official Reddit app itself. I missed Now For Reddit on Android, but I've learnt to live with the official app the past month.   Battery life on iOS... If you were to get the SE or 6S+, it could last you a whole day. Don't get the 6S though if battery is a concern. The battery is smaller than that of the 6 and almost the same to the SE except the SE powers a smaller screen, so you'll get more juice out of the SE or 6S+ compared to the 6S.  Other than that, I think you're good to go! Welcome to iOS	luqman_sha	t3_4yo96v
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p9i80	1471691681	Hey thanks for the informative reply, I really appreciate it!  What do you mean about reddit apps being "killed off" in the app store? I hadn't heard of that.  I'll be waiting for the 7 anyways, but thanks for letting me know about the battery issues with the 6 models.	swskeptic	t1_d6p9clq
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p9o2x	1471692248	You seem pretty much to have decided what you want, so, why second thoughts? Even if you get it and don't like after a while, you can get your money back by selling it. I've used my iPhone 6 almist 2 years now, paid 600€, being offered 550€ from people on listed advert pages here. You're not losing any money if that's one of your gripes.	FailedPotatoSeed	t1_d6p9c59
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p9pk9	1471692388	Well not really. Like I said, I've never really used iOS much, at least not for many years, and I wanted to make sure there wasn't anything major that I would run into if I upgraded.  I like to make the most informed decision possible and I figured you guys would be the best people to ask!	swskeptic	t1_d6p9o2x
t3_4yobli	t1_d6p9tdr	1471692738	It's wonderful. You have to remember it's still the most recently supported device so it's not like any updates so far have degraded usability. I'm running iOS 10 beta and it's more stable than iOS 9.	sampleabuser	t3_4yobli
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p9tnn	1471692765	Widgets are possible on a jailbroken phone. I'd say get the phone shortly after it gets out and don't update. Pangu or taig will likely have a tool shortly after its released.   Personally I have a 6s on the latest jailbreak-able iOS version and love it. Cydia takes some getting used to, but that's what r/jailbreak is for.   Oh and if battery is an issue, get an external one. Yea you'll probably look goofy, but who has the badass jailbroken iPhone in their pocket? That's right. You do.	tricknasty9	t3_4yo96v

t3_4yo96v	t1_d6p9zl2	1471693289	So if I'm reading things correctly it's $10 per month to be able to uplaod my music and stream it? Not criticizing, just making sure I've got it straight. Thanks.	swskeptic	t1_d6p9quk
t3_4yobli	t1_d6paad9	1471694223	I've had my iPhone 6S since December and it's still treating me well. The battery is good enough for my usage. If I'm not playing games, it will easily last me the day with texting, browsing and music. If I'm playing games, it won't last a day, but I don't mind carrying around a skinny 5000mah Xiaomi to keep me going throughout the day.	MarvelsBlackCat	t3_4yobli
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6paen2	1471694569	But you're swiping away any info that you found important and now less important? Look, on an iPhone you can use core features with no adding/modding/customizing. Calling, texting, surfing, all that standard shabam. Installing APK files outside the store doesn't work. Having a weather widget in the status bar is ok, but nothing like android, even though apple ass kissers would name it the best thing ever launched since the first rocket launch to the moon (you'll have to be able to distinguish difference between uninformed fanboys and unbiased users). You can't really do much with ios. Nothing in fact. You can't even have your own toggles or independent volume settings per app/sound/function, it's all or nothing all the way. I've been using ios for 3 years now after using android since it released and I'm going back as soon as the new nexus 6 iteration is out.	FailedPotatoSeed	t1_d6p9pk9

t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pakij	1471695052	I mainly use my phone at work, not being tied to a wall is great. Best $10 I've spent. I just have the battery in one pocket, the cord running through my belt loop to my phone in my other pocket.	tricknasty9	t1_d6p9y7u
t3_4yobli	t1_d6parlk	1471695609	I've been hating mine battery last about 4 1/2 hours max and the speaker sounds terrible. I've talked with Apple and have done full restores but my battery is "fine" I'm trading it in for the 7.	UsernameError404	t3_4yobli
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pat3v	1471695725	Same boat. 6S from Day One, but even at 4.7 inches, it's a two handed phone 75%+ of the time.   SE very attractive option right about now.	HenMeister	t1_d6p963i
t3_4yobli	t1_d6paxvl	1471696087	It has been awesome 10 months.   Performance is superb. It is beating shit out of latest android phones (also Note 7). Ram management is solid. Lots of apps and browser tabs stay alive. The memory is crazy fast! Super fast app installs and super fast app launch speeds.  For my usage battery is bit weak but it is due to the capacity. Battery has not degraded so no complaints.  Overall a pleasure to use.	Innocent_D3vil	t3_4yobli
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pay3j	1471696103	It's a complete lock down... Every 3rd party system app you can download (chrome, keyboard etc) are just reskinned apple API' with a few tweaks here and there that really doesn't offer much stability.	FailedPotatoSeed	t1_d6pagci
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pbk18	1471697706	I'm moving back to the plus sized 7 when it is released.  I rarely make it past 7pm with the 6s battery.  When I had the plus on the iPhone 6 it would be at around 35% at bedtime.	Ryyjad	t3_4yobli
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pc3i0	1471699033	I really enjoy mine. But I hate the camera. In any low lite situations it's far worse than my girlfriend's 6.	Polarissucks01	t3_4yobli
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pccwr	1471699612	It's great. Performance (particularly games) still feels way better than most top-end Android phones that I've had a chance to play with. If it's the last Apple phone with a headphone jack, it should be a great phone for at least a couple more years.  So long as I don't break it, that is... I see a *lot* of cracked iPhones around since the 6 and 6s, I get the impression that a lot more people are managing to break them than the 5/5s  3D Touch hasn't really become the big feature that it could/should have been, though. I don't find myself using it much, and app developers are still reluctant to design a UI around a feature that's not available on all devices.	bluescrn	t3_4yobli
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pckhi	1471700058	Why are u discouraging him though? You tried it and hated it, he might try it and love it. I was an android user for years and I can't imagine going back to that mess. To me, iOS is miles better. Not in features, but in performance and reliability.	Jefundhe	t1_d6paen2
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pcocl	1471700285	It adds way more noise since it can't see.	Polarissucks01	t1_d6pc40p
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pcw56	1471700742	Contrary to some opinions on this thread, I have had the 6s+ since December and I still love the size.  I wasn't sure I would like the big size but I love it. I'm a taller guy (6'2") and I can still use the phone 90% of the time with one hand. I have the apple silicone case and it helps me grip the phone easier.   The battery is still amazing, I use the phone from 6 am to 11 pm and usually have &gt;30% left. I haven't tried iOS10 though.	BennyKB	t3_4yobli
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pcygq	1471700877	If you wanna upload your own music, don't use Apple Music! Use iTunes Match. It's only 25 for a year of service and works great for me. The storage limit it is also something insanely high. And you can use it across multiple devices if you ever get any. http://www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-match/	twhmike	t1_d6p9zl2
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pcz4u	1471700916	It's decent, but I miss the freedom of using my phone like a flash drive, especially as an avid podcast and audio book listener. Also I find it inconvenient to have to charge it again before I drive home from work, as it usually reached 20% life by 2pm. Otherwise, the speed is nice, and I never worry about lag or stuttering especially when typing.	Miggz989	t3_4yobli
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pd11f	1471701029	There is a measurement for Usage time and Standby time and my Usage time stays pretty consistent around 6-7 hours.  Given that iOS does have awesome standby when screen off, screen on time would be near to Usage time.	Innocent_D3vil	t1_d6pbb13
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pd42z	1471701202	He needs features and freedom. I'm not discouraging him (read my comment prior to the last one). I'm telling him how it is. If it sounds discouraging to you, you might rethink what you really think about ios, because I was being purely honest. I don't know what you call android, but judging from you fanboyness, I'd say you had some budget branded phone which was branded "android" while in fact, it has less to do with android than you think. Most phones use android as base driver and main driver is the company's own overlay (touchwiz, sense, lg ui, etc)... That's not android you experienced my little buddy. If you want to know how an android phone works, you should really only be using nexus devices since they are the only ones true vanilla android phones. The rest, that call their phones android phones, are just deluting people into buying something "common" and something they already know. Imagine how confused people would be if every company decided to advertise with their own ui overlay/main user os version, people would think it's another os with own store and doubt if all the apps are there and how good the device works with that "touchwiz"... Don't talk before you know what you're talking about! Peace out 😎	FailedPotatoSeed	t1_d6pckhi
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pdfri	1471701857	You've been able to side load apps on iOS for years. I believe for as long as the App Store has existed. Please stop spreading misinformation about "not being able to" because that's completely wrong.	C02JN1LHDKQ1	t1_d6p9clq
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pdoq3	1471702353	&gt; Oh and if battery is an issue, get an external one. Yea you'll probably look goofy, but who has the badass jailbroken iPhone in their pocket? That's right. You do.   The 5000mah packs are pretty skinny. The Xiaomi, for example, is about the size of my iPhone 6S. Fits in the pocket very nicely. Get a short cable and you can charge on the go. I don't see it possible that someone could burn both the iPhone battery and a 5000mah in one day. So battery trouble should be negated.	MarvelsBlackCat	t1_d6p9tnn
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pdp75	1471702378	I think they are referring to have widgets on the homescreen, not in the Notification Center.	MarvelsBlackCat	t1_d6pcl0b
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pdrxv	1471702532	Wow, what do you use your phone for that uses the battery so fast? I had a 6 Plus and switched to an SE and both of them last more than 24 hours on a charge and until recently I've been streaming music and podcasts about 8 hours a day.	BrokenStrides	t1_d6p8cjl
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pe04f	1471702973	Well, since you took the effort to write out that long tirade about how I don't know what android is, and tried to be edgy by calling me little buddy, I will grace your rant with a reply. Android is the operating system. Just because a phone uses an overlay, or skin, that does not change the core operating system. It's still an android. And I would never suggest a nexus to anyone. It's boring. It has no extra features that make it unique. It's never been known for its camera or battery or build quality. It's only advantage is no bloat ware and fast updates. And you can get those with iPhone. The op said he doesn't care much for the features that you think make android superior, so what's stopping him? You are the real fanboy here mate. EDIT: And you say he *needs* features and freedom, what are you, his mother?	Jefundhe	t1_d6pd42z
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pe21d	1471703075	Op! Come quickly! People are fighting over u *grabs popcorn*	mayaisme	t1_d6pe04f
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pe3pa	1471703162	The 6+ has a bigger battery, the SE had the same battery and a smaller screen to power. It's normal that both of those would last longer than the 6S	El_Jengibre_Cojones	t1_d6pdrxv
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pe9jv	1471703465	I've always kept my iPhones for 2 years or so, since I'm on the S cycle and I can safely say the 6s is running stronger now a year later than any previous iPhone after a year.   It's smooth. It's fast. It still feels new.   I'm on iOS 10 dev beta 7 and it's only getting smoother.	Firsttimepostr	t3_4yobli
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6peisl	1471703936	I'm on iOS and planning to escape to Android again as rapidly as possible, I'm now fed up. I lasted about 6 months happy with an iPhone, now I'm planning to buy a one plus 3 If you value your freedom and want any type of customisation, value downloading from external sources and having control over how your phone looks, you will  begin to hate iOS once the novelty factor wears off. Personally I wouldn't recommend an iPrison, Android gives you more for your money and lots more freedom Also, root solutions are always around for Android, jailbreak for iPhone drops about once in a blue moon and even so you can't do anywhere near as much with it as with root	evilkitty69	t3_4yo96v
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6peuo5	1471704510	Yea sorry about that. I meant on the lock screen and home screen, similar to androids. Hell, I can even make my phone look and respond exactly like an android if I wanted.	tricknasty9	t1_d6pcl0b

t3_4yobli	t1_d6pftd4	1471706199	I couldn't be more happy with the phone. I bought the phone around 10 months ago and i've been pleased ever since.  The battery is still great, i haven't atleast noticed any hinders in battery department.  My phone surived coffee spill to which i was quite impressed. (nothing happened at all to the phone!!)  Not to mention some drops. (nothing big tho)  I've used phone mostly without any protection (screen protectors, cases etc) And yes if you look at some bright light you see some micro scratches on the screen, but that's normal i guess.  The back of the phone is still without any marks (space grey).  This might be quite long comment but i really really am impressed with the 6s.	Knickss	t3_4yobli

t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pg88x	1471706884	Just to add Pocket Casts is available on iOS and just went through a huge update! It might be cross platform syncing, I'm not sure. I use Overcasts and it's really really popular. As for the torrents I use a side loaded app called "iTransmission" this isn't available on the normal App Store, I've had to connect to my mac and essentially use a free developer account to be able to have non App Store apps on my iPhone. I also have gameboy emulators. It's something worth googling if you are interested	imadeofwax	t1_d6p93cy
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pgtgj	1471707828	You'll hate the fact that battery isn't removable. So your phone basically has an expiration date as batteries work best for only 1.5 year or so	winphan	t3_4yo96v

t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pja10	1471711686	So recently i switched back to iPhone 6s+ coming from Samsung note4, it was easy and smooth transaction, I love the way the iPhone operates smoothly compared to the note, I contemplated waiting for the note 7 but seeing and using the iPhone made me want to pick it up right away, it does everything I need it to and am use to on the android.	mrchokabich	t3_4yo96v
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pjh2j	1471711991	I'm with you. Been pretty miserable with my iPhone 6 plus. I will probably get the Note 7 unless the Nexus is good enough for my needs.	fist_taco	t1_d6peisl
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pjrr8	1471712460	I don't use all the apps you use but I just wanted to say that I'd never used an Apple product safe for an ipod. I used android smart phones for maybe 5, 6 years? When iPhone 6s came along, I was somehow convinced by a friend to switch to it. I did, and I love my new iphone. It's got everything I need, and is very easy to use despite initial fears if not being able to adapt to it. The interface is sleek and user-friendly. I like it better than android.	hanamihoshi	t3_4yo96v
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pjusn	1471712589	My thoughts exactly. There's something about iOS that's sleek and smooth. I was a long time android user before I got iphone 6s. The transition was surprisingly fuss free.	hanamihoshi	t1_d6pja10
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pjv9b	1471712610	It's definitely a two handed phone unless you have very large hands. 4.7 feels so much larger because of the large bezels. I had a note 4 that was nearly the exact same size as this 6s when I put one on top of the other.	toothpastemouth	t1_d6p963i
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pk5v4	1471713075	I love my phone, it feels sturdier than my 6 did, it has very few problems. But the battery life is definitely a negative. I don't know if it's because of the beta, or just my battery, because even when off of the beta its performance was...questionable at best.	HammerStark	t3_4yobli
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pkdtx	1471713421	Was an android fanboy before I had my 6S Plus, and now I'll never go back. Was tired of shitty performance and battery on Android, and after having a Nexus phone with the same story, that was the last straw.  My Plus' performance is what you would expect from a top-end phone- blazing fast. It's so fast you don't really think about it, because things just work. I'm never waiting on my phone to catch up; it can keep up with my tasks perfectly fine.  And it's battery is great. I use auto brightness and never go out of my way to conserve battery life, and the phone still lasts me from when I wake up (this varies, but can be from 6-9) to when I go to bed (from 8-12).   All in all, I'm in love with the iPhone and I have no complaints whatsoever.	terthii	t3_4yobli
t3_4yobli	t1_d6pkp3a	1471713914	5SE owner here, I'll say, you won't regret it, I was actually using a 6s plus, cause I watch YouTube and do quite a lot of content consumption on my phone, but the bigger phone just didn't feel right in the hand. Going back to the SE, was initially a little strange, especially typing. But after about a week, it was perfect! Now I can lay on bed at night browsing reddit with my hands weight a ton!	jlin37	t1_d6p963i
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6ple5y	1471715027	Well I've asked on this sub what apps they used for Reddit, and one particular app keeps being mentioned named Alien Blue. But it was killed off the app store and only the iPad version was still there?   Battery issues is I guess only for the 6S. The battery is smaller than the 6 and roughly the same as the SE. The SE however powers a smaller screen so it has better than that of the 6S, that some say, it's as good as the 6S+.  Waiting for the 7 is a good choice though! If you don't like what you see, the 6S and 6S+ would drop it's prices!	luqman_sha	t1_d6p9i80
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6plisn	1471715238	Forgive me about this. As I did say, I am new to iOS as   &gt;I've been using android for the past 7 years   All I know is the only way to install apps is through the app store, unlike android where you could just install an apk and it works.

t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pm4fs	1471716190	&gt; unlike android where you could just install an apk and it works.  It works the same way on iOS. You would just have to trust the code signing cert by clicking Yes on the pop-up you get while installing the app.	C02JN1LHDKQ1	t1_d6plisn

t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pmez5	1471716656	But these apps have to be cracked first by an "unknown developer" am I right? Do you have a link to one I could try out?  Like what do I search up to find these apps? I could just google an apk. Do I google for an ipa for iPhone apps?	luqman_sha	t1_d6pm4fs

t3_4yobli	t1_d6pmtyy	1471717300	Had it for about 11 months.  No issues with it what so ever. I've never had my battery run out, and I would consider myself somewhere in-between an average and a heavy user throughout the day.    Today, with a a day half way over, but not much phone use, I'm at 76% and my phone tells me I have had 2hr, 38mins of usage, and 6hr, 38mins of standby.  That's pretty anecdotal, my usage today has been mostly web browsing, and alien blue use.  No speed issues ever.  I don't believe I've ever noticed any kind of slow down in the OS, or any in any app (baring the Facebook app, but fuck that piece of shit) that wasn't attributed to a bug or a connection issue.  The hardware seems good.  I've had it in the bare minimum of a bumper case, no screen protector.  I do have one tiny scratch/chip/divot in the screen that is noticeable if I look, and a couple of wisps or swirls on the glass.  The back is flawless, minus some scratching on the apple logo.  (space grey color by the way)  I am coming from a 4s, then a 5s, and now to a 6s.  6s is certainly better of the three, but that seems obvious.    I would want to obviously wait and see what the 7 has to offer rather than recommend you buy the 6s at this second, but I actually have a feeling that if the rumors are true, and there aren't really any surprises, I may want to stick with a 6s for cheaper rather than get a 7.	beardtamer	t3_4yobli
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6pmu0y	1471717302	It sounds like you're talking about pirating apps, which is stealing.  iPhone users generally aren't poor like Android users so we don't have a need for this.	C02JN1LHDKQ1	t1_d6pmez5

Before that, I had Android phones   Currently on iOS 10 beta and I love it even more because of the heavy 3D touch implementation. Battery life has been really solid for me getting me through the day and considerably better than iOS 9. Camera continues to be great. Storage hasn't been a problem.   I love my iPhone because it runs consistently well day in and day out with little to no hiccups. It just *works*.   I do feel very enticed by the note 7 though. Best Android smartphone out right now hands down.	shmangit69	t3_4yobli
t3_4yobli	t1_d6q05be	1471738911	It's still under warranty because you've had it less than a year, so it's possible that they'd replace the screen under warranty to fix that dead pixel.	nathreed	t1_d6ppkms
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6q2j82	1471742752	Thank you for sharing this. I think I'll probably stick with Android for now unfortunately :(	swskeptic	t1_d6pt8cp
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6q2mfh	1471742899	Wish you hadn't gotten downvoted so hard, this is totally true. My original Note 4 battery started dying on me almost exactly 1.5 years after I got it. That's why I got the larger Anker battery. That shit is soooo nice.   EDIT: That being said, I'd be open to getting a battery case like the Mophie case or something so that's not a total deal breaker.	swskeptic	t1_d6pgtgj
t3_4yobli	t1_d6q3jw6	1471744412	6S Plus, still amazing battery even on iOS 10 latest public beta. Could not be happier (although I was briefly tempted by Note 7 after watching reviews).	YourNeighbour	t3_4yobli
t3_4yobli	t1_d6q44kv	1471745308	Really? I'm looking to change from the SE to the 6S mainly because i miss the curves of the 6 series.	RougeCrown	t1_d6p963i
t3_4yobli	t1_d6q5w92	1471748266	Dang, I purchased my phone at a similar time as you and I'm at 67% and 426 cycles. Battery life is the only complaint I have about this phone including the random shutdowns at 30%.	The_9_month_lurker	t1_d6ppkms

t3_4yo96v	t1_d6q62ol	1471748574	Tbh, for me, it is really the file manager thing that hurts me.   A few times a month, Verizon does work on the FIOS cables underground, so I lose home internet service. When I had an Android (HTC) as my primary device, that didn't stop me from being able to upload and download files b/c it has a file manager. I could just connect the USB cable, drag and drop regardless of the file type or extension, and upload to my email from the same file manager.  I can't do that with an iPhone. I have to (and luckily, I get this free from my carrier) hotspot with my Galaxy Note5, and then use the Note5 as I did the HTC.   If I want to add an attachment to an email from the iPhone that isn't a picture, the item has to be stored in Google Drive/iCloud Drive first, which makes no sense if I have no internet in the first place.   Sorry to deter you D:	OptionalCookie	t1_d6q2j82
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6q6iup	1471749368	&gt; Many high end Android phones are more expensive than iPhones.   The s7 edge is $709 for the 64gb version. The iPhone 6s is $749 for the 64gb version.	OptionalCookie	t1_d6ptbi7
t3_4yo96v	t1_d6q6oxj	1471749672	Then what do you even mean by side loading apps? If possible I do wanna try out Alien Blue which was already removed from the app store. And yes, fyi, I've been buying all my apps and paying in app purchases the past month. Your statement is just plain rude.  And in case you didn't realise, most people got an iPhone because they're low in cash. Because iPhones could last for a long time so they  don't have to upgrade every 2 years. I've seen friends still walking around with their 4S and 5.	luqman_sha	t1_d6pmu0y
t3_4yobli	t1_d6q6rhw	1471749800	Do you think that the overall speed that the betas are providing is going to translate to the official releases of ios 10?	TheKingInTheNorth98	t1_d6pmdhg
t3_4yobli	t1_d6q7uzo	1471751756	I got my 6s on launch day and it still works as good as the first day I got it, so yes, I would still recommend getting this phone! It's the best phone I've owned and can see myself being happy with it for the next 1-2 years, maybe even longer. Battery life isn't the best but I'm hoping it will be improved once iOS 10 comes out.

t3_4yo96v	t1_d6qab1a	1471756411	I just jumped from a GS6 -&gt; iphone SE for a medical device and I have loved the phone in the 4 days I've owned it. Feels well built.  I hate the facebook application in android and iphone, so i just use the mobile site. On android, when you try to open messages, it forces you to install messenger, which I don't want to do. On iOS 10, it allows me to send/read my messages, so that's a win.  Reddit - I honestly have only used the mobile reddit site from my phone a couple of times. Netflix works great on iphone. HBO now works fine. Gmail apps have worked great, as I don't have any apple e-mail accounts. I use google play music, and that works just fine.  Basically - I don't think it's going to drive oyu nuts at all. I use windows for work, but had to jump to the iphone for a medical device. Not missing android yet.	anotherbrokephotog	t3_4yo96v

I thought it was more like a challenge, I don't know. I'm new to iOS and the last thing I would do is think I'm superior because I was an android user or whatever. I just wanted you guys to show me the best features about the apps you use for reddit, why do you use them, what does your app have that others don't, etc. Just that.

t3_4za2e3	t1_d6uzq6s	1472064019	Here's what I posted when someone previously asked this question:  I've owned every flagship iPhone since the 4S (4S, 5, 5S, 6, 6S) and going from the 6 to 6S was easily the biggest jump of any of them.  * Much faster A9 processor. The A9 is a much bigger jump over the A8 than the A8 was over the A7.  * Double the RAM, which is very noticeable - especially with Safari page reloads (or lack thereof).  * Live Photos are awesome.  * Much faster TouchID fingerprint scanner.  * Improved camera (this one isn't a huge jump, but the megapixel count is higher while retaining the same quality, meaning you can zoom into pictures better).   * It's made of a stronger 7000 series aluminum, which makes the iPhone more resistant to bending.   * Improved water resistance. You still can't put the iPhone under water, but the 6S has better gaskets and seals, meaning in the event of an accident, it's more like to survive than the 6 would.  * 3D Touch is great. This is especially true in iOS 10, where it has all sorts of new functions.  * The vibration motor uses the 'Taptic' technology Apple introduced with the Apple Watch and new MacBook last year. It's much more precise and feels better than the normal motor.  * The M9 motion chip allows for "Hey Siri" even when the phone isn't plugged in. Plus, in iOS 10, it supports raise-to-wake functionality, which is great.	heyyoudvd	t3_4za2e3

t3_4zkm43	t1_d6wtphj	1472169416	Enjoy the transition period.  I remember when I jumped ship from Nexus5 to iphone6 I had the same feeling about battery life. Like you don't need to charge your phone in the car at all anymore. After 800+ cycles on the battery and loss of ~30% of battery capacity iphone is still a usable phone	JustThall	t3_4zkm43
t3_4zkm43	t1_d6wtze8	1472169844	&gt;What the everliving actual titty fuck is this battery life?  Basically it's the screen. It takes a shit load more power to run a 1080p or higher screen. If you can manage with it on a lower brightness setting you'll give yourself a further win.	84awkm	t3_4zkm43
t3_4zkm43	t1_d6wxiuk	1472175150	I went from a 6+ to an SE last month, and while I know I'm going to only be using this phone until the new one comes out (it's a work phone), it's a huge change for me at least. I loved my Nexus 5, and while I really thought it was the perfect size, and would make sense to get the 6, I got a 6+ instead. Fast forward a year and a half, it took a dump, and the SE was my cheapest option for now.  I have no issues with the SE aside from the size, but I knew that going into it. Battery life and performance have been great. I really want to try out the 7 (not 7+), but having all that screen space was glorious.	JukeboxJohnny	t1_d6wmvm0
t3_4zkm43	t1_d6x7s3j	1472194314	I had the z3c before I dropped it and switched to se. The screen on time for the z3c averages 6 hours for me but the stand by is unpredictable.	Bronsonite	t3_4zkm43

t3_4zpph7	t1_d6xrdqf	1472232649	Do you live near an Apple Store? If so, I would recommend scheduling an appointment to bring your phone in for a Genius to look at it. If they deem an out of warranty replacement is necessary, that will cost you $299.   If your phone rings when it's not on silent, I would hold out until the 7 is announced since the 6s will then drop in price.	n1ck1982	t3_4zpph7
t3_4zpph7	t1_d6xrn4w	1472232986	It's probably a 40 minute drive. I really wanted to wait for the 7 for prices to drop, but I've already missed so many phone calls because of it not vibrating. I'd turn the ringer on but I don't need my phone going off during class..	tjm9707	t1_d6xrdqf
t3_4zpph7	t1_d6xsxdn	1472234651	Even if you schedule an appointment, you're not obligated to pay the out of warranty to repair. But at least Apple can diagnose what the specific issue is (seems to be hardware related).	n1ck1982	t3_4zpph7
t3_4zkm43	t1_d6xsyfi	1472234690	Every morning I turn it on. I'm using it 99 percent of the time.

t3_4zpph7	t1_d6xv4g2	1472237488	Buy a Fitbit charge. It shows your calls on your wrist and vibrates. Then hold out for new phone.   Or get a cheap pair of Bluetooth headphones and just keep them in your pocket. They will vibrate when you get a call.	CobraDS96	t3_4zpph7

t3_4zkm43	t1_d6y0cvb	1472244428	I also just got the 64GB SE a couple days ago, after using Android for the last two years. I initially thought the smaller screen would be an issue, but I got used to it right away. The phone is a *lot* snappier; apps work much better (ie Snapchat), and the battery life is just incredible. It's now 4:45pm; I've been on my phone since around 10am, listening to Spotify, watching videos, and Redditing. My battery is at 76%, when on my Galaxy it would be in the low 50s by now.  However, I used to also have an iPhone 4S for about two some odd years. Getting used to the SE was easy. It took me back to my 4S days :p	Isunova	t1_d6wmvm0
t3_4zkm43	t1_d6y0h4c	1472244589	It's better in some regards, like stability and snappiness.  Android still kicks ios's ass in terms of customizability and openness. I'm going to miss having global Facebook messenger chat heads and the file Explorer.	Isunova	t1_d6xa6mk
t3_4zkm43	t1_d6y3vub	1472249514	I also went from Nexus 5 to SE about two weeks ago. I can't believe how much better the battery life is on the SE. I easily get two full days without any problem. The Google apps I did install run great--maybe even better.	dkreeg	t3_4zkm43

t3_4zkm43	t1_d6y4rw3	1472250863	Two major features of my Galaxy S6 that are keeping me from going back to iPhone are the IR blaster (with built-in, easily configurable, universal remote control app) and the physical 'back' button at the bottom of the phone.  I constantly have the desire to go back to iOS, but I would so miss these two features!	NewReddit101	t1_d6xved4
t3_4zpph7	t1_d6y885c	1472256351	I saw the part on iFixIt for $10. Probably a 15 minute repair. Screen needs to come off then swap the bad vibrator for a new one. My guess is $$40-$50 at a repair shop.	Npiper05	t3_4zpph7
t3_4zpph7	t1_d6ybk7i	1472261925	Yeah I saw that too, would just fix it myself but I'd have to buy the tools	tjm9707	t1_d6y885c

t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6yke84	1472280487	Been using a 64 gb unlocked 5s since January 2014 and looking to upgrade soon. There has been lag since iOS 8, but the phone is still perfectly usable for everything I need on iOS 9.3.5. I wish I didn't have to charge the phone as often as I do, that it had ac wifi and a better cameras, but what I have is certainly adequate for a few more months.   I usually upgrade during the 's' cycle, but I did not find either the 6s or 6s+ a slam dunk upgrade in 2015, and waited it out due to my indecision. The 6s was the perfect size, but the camera improvements were underwhelming (I don't care about 4k video) and the battery life was hardly an improvement. The 6s+ had the battery life I wanted, and the OIS  for the camera, but the phone was simply too clunky and big for one handed use and certainly not worth a 100 dollar premium IMO.   When I pay for the most expensive phone on the market, I hate having to make compromises to things I care about most in a phone, especially since I use it 3-8 hours a day, every day. I've thought about upgrading to the SE which I will if my phone dies/gets stolen/lost. I'll probably wait for the iPhone 7 and Google Nexus Marlin/Sailfish to be reviewed before making an upgrade. Based on the camera alone, I am considering the S7 as well.	andyandthetuna	t3_4zt0hp

t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6ynoxr	1472292567	Not a 5S, but a 5 which I got shortly after launch in late 2012.  I used to upgrade every 2 years when my contract expired (3G &gt; 4 &gt; 5) in part because the old phone was really struggling to cope with the new OS and felt very slow. And the upgrade to 4 was a light-years jump, the 5 less so. When the 6 was launched my 5 still felt quick, and it coped well with the upgrade to iOS 8. So I switched to a sim-only plan and saved myself £25 per month.  Now almost 4 years after launch the 5 is feeling slow (I'm now on the latest version of iOS 9). It often pauses for 3-5 seconds when entering text or launching certain apps. I don't know how it will cope with iOS 10. Cosmetically it's near-perfect, because I've always kept it in a case and used a screen protector. The battery life is poor though, even though the battery has been swapped.  So time to upgrade, but I don't yet know if I'll go for a 7 or a 6S. I suppose it depends on what currently-unknown features are announced at the keynote, and what the storage options are.	colin_staples	t3_4zt0hp
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6yocx8	1472295226	I got it for $150 from a friend back in march in good shape and currently pay $0 a month for service via RingPlus... I use it because it's cheap and works well. The battery is annoying and I wish it had a bigger screen but otherwise performance is just fine on 9.3.3	AFlyingGoat	t3_4zt0hp
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6yod3b	1472295246	My friend gave it to me, because I didn't have a smartphone.  I can't afford to buy a plan for it, so it's more of a PDA/iPod at this point.  But wherever there is wifi access, I can use it to text, use iMessage, go online, and even call if I want.	MeowMixSong	t3_4zt0hp
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6yoty3	1472297009	I am, and it's only the 16gb model. My contact went up in July I think. Didn't have any issues (besides storage) until about a week ago my charging port has gotten finicky.   I'll wait a month to upgrade so I can either get the new model or the 6s plus for $100 less than I would pay to today.	afd33	t3_4zt0hp
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6youfe	1472297055	Don't like the larger size of the 6 and haven't been convinced to upgrade to an SE. It gets a little fussy sometimes but the 5S will still do everything a 6S will do minus 3D Touch and Live Photos neither of which I care about.	Flffdddy	t3_4zt0hp
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6yp05k	1472297621	I got my 6s+ stolen back in july and just waiting for the 7 to come out. I am really not feeling the 5s though, battery life is not what it used to be and I had really gotten used to not worrying about it. I always have a battery pack with me now which I do not like.	gayru_laghima	t3_4zt0hp
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6yp5ow	1472298140	I have a 5 (not 5s) with 64g. I use it to read (audio books) the occasional app (over 45g worth of occasional apps) , as a GPS and as a phone. I like the size and weight, the battery life is OK. I am waiting to see what new thing apple offers but unless there is a compelling reason to change, I may just squeeze another year out of this gem.

t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6yp8pg	1472298430	I still use a 4S because it still works. I inherited it from my wife when she bought a 6S. I'm not a gamer, I use the phone for actually making calls (weird, I know), and for Evernote and Google Maps, so it's really all I need.	emkay99	t3_4zt0hp

t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6yrr8t	1472305078	It's my daily driver, still works great.  Touch of lag, compared to my wife's 6S, but I didn't like the size of the 6.  Probably upgrade to the SE if this one ever dies.	Keldog7	t3_4zt0hp
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6yruyx	1472305308	Have you heard of Freedom Pop? Sounds like it would be perfect for your uses. $1 + free shipping for the sim kit, $0 a month for service and you get 200 calls, 500 texts and 200mb data. The way it works is you get the freedom pop app and it makes all the calls and texts over data, so not a "real" phone plan but better than what you have now and basically free.	goatboye	t1_d6yod3b
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6ysgio	1472306617	I'm still on the 5S. I prefer the shape and minimalist style of it. I just love the shape of it and how I can use it with one hand. Money isn't an issue with upgrading.  However, the 16GB is just too low. So I'm probably forced to get the iPhone 7 when it comes out next month.  I'm also considering the 5 SE because I just love the shape so much. But for the price I think iPhone 7 is the best upgrade. I don't know how I'll cope with that 5.5" screen.	rgr555	t3_4zt0hp
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6ysvn0	1472307469	I also use a 4s, and I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from updating from 8 to 9. Anything other than calls and iMessage I forget what I was even doing by the time the app loads...	mattcanfixit	t1_d6yp8pg

t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6yv1wz	1472311453	No, if you jailbreak you can go back to 6.1.3, but because 7 and 8 are no longer signed you can't put those back on unless of course you have a full backup on your PC in iTunes.	mattcanfixit	t1_d6yubzg
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6yv6gu	1472311673	I'm also still using a 4S (bought in early 2012) for messaging, surfing the web, activity apps, etc. Since the battery life is fine and the only issue I have is not being able to run the newer apps due to being on iOS 7, I can't really justify buying a new phone just yet.	tayaro	t1_d6yp8pg
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6yvo17	1472312498	I still use it because I have pretty small hands and I didn't think the bigger form factor would suit me but I think I'm ready to move on to a larger screen. It will just take time to get used to, but with technology, you can't be afraid of change.	BrianSez	t3_4zt0hp
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6ywblb	1472313595	5s. Cause I can't afford a new phone at the current time. Running current iOS with no trouble at all. Just as fast and reliable as the day I purchased it although naturally some battery degradation. I keep a power case around if I need more continuous power. And they're cheap now - like $10.	tsdguy	t3_4zt0hp

If you're capable of looking after a phone and it doesn't develop any faults due to a manufacturing flaw or age (eg battery degradation) then it's easy to keep any smartphone running for many years. You just have to pick your "cut off point". What I mean is the point where you stop installing iOS updates because they've reached a point where they totally gimp the performance of your device.	84awkm	t3_4zt0hp

t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6z1nh3	1472322260	Because it works.  I love the size and the design; not much of a fan of the rounded edges on the 6/s/+es, and don't need or really like the larger screens.  If it doesn't run iOS 10 well (haven't tried the beta but from what I hear, it should run fine) or if I break the screen, I'll almost definitely get the SE.   With Google Photos I have enough storage space. None of the apps I use need *that much* computing power, and the few games I play are puzzle games that don't need much either. The battery life is enough to last me through the day. The camera is good enough for my purposes, and I don't take many photos anyway.  I'd like to have Apple Pay; that's the one feature I'm missing, and I'll eventually get it with the SE. Force touch I do not care about, and it seems that no one I know with a 6/s/+ uses it either, so I don't miss it now and unless there's some amazing use for it in iOS 10 that doesn't just work with a long press, I won't miss it on the SE either.  Am I missing any big advantages of the newer phones?	JARSInc	t3_4zt0hp
t3_4zkm43	t1_d6z3xhf	1472325893	I will agree that the 810 isnt the best.  Though your SE is also pushing a much smaller resolution. If my 2560X1440 phone can match your SE in terms of battert while I'm pushing a 1440p resolution, that talks more about the 6P	Jinxyface	t1_d6ywh9t
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6z43ti	1472326176	Still on iPhone 5 since 2012, because:   * it works well   * I've played few times with a 6S and I didn't feel the urge to change. When I tried the 5 I had a 3GS and I felt a *huuuge* difference   * honestly, I was using the iPhone heavily in the last years, now I'm a bit more... older? My needs are changed now	misterlight	t3_4zt0hp

t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6z6kjg	1472330193	My main phone is an iPhone 6 but I still use the 5S as a secondary phone whenever my 6 is being charged and when I'm driving I use the 5S as the phone that is connected to the aux	batsassin	t3_4zt0hp
t3_4zkm43	t1_d6z8ror	1472333902	The Note 5 also pushes QHD and is significantly better in identical workloads. The 6P suffers from having a low binned inefficient Note 4 panel. Couple that with the 810 and in comparison to other phablets. The 6P doesn't compare in the battery department.	linus121	t1_d6z3xhf
t3_4zkm43	t1_d6z8x8i	1472334164	Yeah, I know the 6P doesn't use a top end panel. No other phone besides Samsungs really do. But my point is, if a 2560x1440p phone using a known inefficient CPU can match the battery life of a 1136x640 phone...that's really only showing how bad the battery life of the iPhone SE is.

Not trying to start an argument, trying to read off of what's posted, which is very little.	Connir	t1_d6z9hzs
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6z9t7m	1472335698	Ah I get it now.  He's poor so he doesn't want to upgrade.  He's poor so he's self entitled.  He's self entitled so he likely complains about the base model.  Assumptions based off of one fact.  Got it.	Connir	t1_d6z9l5m
t3_4zkm43	t1_d6zcsl4	1472340904	Never mind the SE. The 6P's battery life isn't as great. Not to mention, the battery sizes are proportional to their displays so you can make a comparison to the both. Also, there are top end displays not made by Samsung.	linus121	t1_d6z8x8i
t3_4zkm43	t1_d6zd38q	1472341407	I've never found anyone with bad battery life on a 6P. Even on a very heavy usage day I still get like 5.5-6 hours of SoT at 75% brightness. Could it be better? Sure. But when my friend's new Note 5 barely gets 3 hours of SoT...	Jinxyface	t1_d6zcsl4
t3_4zkm43	t1_d6zddm2	1472341898	You and your friend aren't the same people. You guys don't do the same things on your phones. That's why I said 'when doing identical workloads'. It's funny that you mention that which further proves my point of you guys not having the same usage because the Note 5 has a more efficient CPU and display.	linus121	t1_d6zd38q
t3_4zkm43	t1_d6zdl74	1472342266	Define identical workloads? Because 90% of people use phones to browse Facebook.  If you're talking about doing identical tests down to measuring identical seconds doing identical tasks, that's not really a good measurement either considering "50%" brightness on two phones aren't the same brightness. Among other things.	Jinxyface	t1_d6zddm2
t3_4zkm43	t1_d6ze50p	1472343233	Not everyone uses their phone for Facebook, no one person has identical usage. Some people use their phones a lot, some use them only for a bit.   What are you talking about 'among other things'? Tests like those exist. It's when the brightness is raised to a certain threshold, maybe 100 nits and then are benchmarked to see their performance. Why do you think people value Anandtech reviews so much? They do tests like that.   Also, I took my phone off the charger at 5 AM for work, listened to music for 2 hours (streamed), and then listened to locally stored music for another hour. Talked on the phone for one hour, got on Reddit, Snapchat and Appy Geek for 45 minutes. Afterwards, listened to music again and had a FaceTime call for 30 minutes. Used my phone for Uber and various other things. Ended the day with 10% by bedtime. Brightness is set to auto, bottom line is, my usage isn't yours and your friends isn't yours. That's exactly what I mean when I say 'identical workloads'.   If '90% of people used their phones to browse facebook' was true. We wouldn't have a huge amount of variation to battery life.	linus121	t1_d6zdl74
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6zew2j	1472344545	I've got 5 active iPhones. 3 of those are 5s and one is a 4. They ALL work fine but there are some app limitations with the 4. Why are they still being used? Simple...they aren't broken and they work as well as they did when they were new. I'm not tossing a perfectly good phone for the "latest and greatest". Especially when the "upgrades" on the new models really aren't that significant.	Overland_Odyssey	t3_4zt0hp
t3_4zwze8	t1_d6zf1in	1472344804	This is a super SUPER common problem. It's pretty funny to hear peoples reactions when they pull a dumpster full of lint and pet hair out of their "broken" phone and all of a sudden it's charging again.

t3_4zwze8	t1_d6zio8f	1472351121	I never had this problem. I use a case with dust plugs for the ports. You can use a case to prevent this problem or get individual plugs.

t3_4zwze8	t1_d6zprax	1472366885	It only voids your warranty as far as the dock goes, the magnuson-moss warranty act puts the onus on the company to prove that whatever you did was the cause of the problem. Only applicable in US. I don't know other countries laws.  Edit: that said, I don't recommend using toothpicks. If you don't have a good pair of anti static tweezers, some 99% alcohol, cotton swabs, and canned air, I recommend just having a shop clean it. Any reputable shop should do it for free.	Gorgggg	t1_d6zoup3
t3_4zwze8	t1_d6zso0c	1472376857	The Lightning connector jams the lint inside of the port everytime you plug it in.   The most common sign is when your cable does not lock in place perfectly but goes in angled, and you have to tilt it left and right to find an angle that works.   I use the sim removal tool to carefully pull it out. Usually an unbelievable amount of shit comes out of there. Dont scrape the bottom of the port or you might damage the pins, the lint is almost always in the corners	avlas	t3_4zwze8
t3_4zwze8	t1_d6ztvus	1472381683	Funny story, Apple's internal servicing records specifically mention using a small wooden object (nothing metal) to pull the dust out (if the correct Apple tool is not available) and absolutely say to NOT use compressed air as it can push that dust deeper and/or break other internal components.	lerde	t1_d6zf1in
t3_4zwze8	t1_d6ztyxc	1472382002	I may be mistaken, I just take phone calls and everyone I talk to vouches for the compressed air puff.   If I'm wrong, my mistake!  The toothpick method, carefully enough that you don't rip the contacts off the port, solves the problem 99% of the time. compressed air has worked from the examples that I've heard about.	NuclearLunchDectcted	t1_d6ztvus
t3_4zwze8	t1_d6ztzw0	1472382099	Oh totally, I use compressed air on my device monthly, it's just funny that Apple specifically restricts techs from using that on iPhones and iPads.	lerde	t1_d6ztyxc
t3_4zwze8	t1_d6zu26h	1472382343	Apple's policy is if you physically damage the device, it's not covered. That's why you need to be VERY careful if you drag a toothpick through the port. Don't grind that shit in and think you're grinding plaque off a tooth. You're just getting lint out, not pressure cleaning a porch.   Getting lint/dust out takes a very light touch, you don't need to scrape anything.	NuclearLunchDectcted	t1_d6zlw6p
t3_4zt0hp	t1_d6zvej0	1472386861	Just bought one new 2 months ago to test out iOS and didn't want to break the bank.

t3_4zwze8	t1_d6zvn23	1472387506	IMPORTANT :  If you are going to clean your lightning port, DO NOT use anything metal (paper clip, SIM ejector tool) because you risk damaging the port so your phone won't charge.

t3_4zwze8	t1_d701dh8	1472399209	well tbh the toothpick while softer is fat so your more likely to hit the contacts. a metal object can be thinner so has less chance of hitting them as they are only one side. i find a pin is the best thing as its super thin and you can really pick out the fluff without scraping anything else.  just make sure you keep it pointed at an angle up towards the back of the screen as the contacts are on the bottom of the port (bottom with the phone lying screen up on a table)	nildro	t1_d6zvn23

t3_4zt0hp	t1_d724u3y	1472525799	i use iPhone 5s, it works well, and i'm a girl, i don't want a too large iPhone like iPhone 6s plus.  But now i;m planing to get a iPhone 6 or 6s, it's really cheap now.	loucy888	t3_4zt0hp
t3_4yxdsq	t1_d75l7z9	1472748609	Just got this installed as I come from UK. So took longer to arrive. Pictures will follow when I can access another camera.	lurkaaa	t1_d6rwqnv
t3_4vvbw0	t1_d78ppji	1472957082	Even if you don't have AppleCare, the replacement is $79? I thought it was $329 for some reason	Kofile	t3_4vvbw0
t3_513fur	t1_d78zqxz	1472986504	i think these can be found in some malls/3rd party technician in my country(Malaysia). They are usually secondhand phone which you can get around $75, and sealed them in a fake box with fake accessories like new.	tauffiqs	t3_513fur
t3_513fur	t1_d791shs	1472993449	I got mine when I was at The Philippines. I'm wondering if they used OEM parts on this one since there is no way a used iPhone would look this NEAT. I mean seriously, it looks untouched. Similar to a brandnew one.	h4untingh0ur	t1_d78zqxz
t3_513fur	t1_d7920y1	1472994091	It was probably one of those phones which had every external component replaced with only the logic board remaining original, then sealed up and passed off as "brand new". Very common with phones bought off the internet and 95% of people can't tell the difference. [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JR0CP_8K2k). And I'm pretty sure the warranty starts from first activation date, so it's not surprising that the warranty's out.  If you can get an iPhone pentalobe screwdriver, undo the two bottom screws and take a look at the internals. If there are any trade stamps/stickers inside or the dock flex cowling is missing the S/N, the phone is a refurbished one.	vantt1	t3_513fur
t3_513fur	t1_d7948fu	1472999200	Oh shoot. I am never getting an iPhone from a third party store ever again. Thanks for this! Everything fake has always something to do with the Chinese. Next thing you know they already copied the logic board on the iPhone too! Anyways, I watched the video and it  made me feel uneasy lmao. It could be worse though, I mean what if the phone was a "secondhand" unit and not a refurbished one? What if something on that damn thing had to be replaced?	h4untingh0ur	t1_d7920y1
t3_513fur	t1_d794ovo	1473000133	Anyways the fake box made me chuckle. Monday was printed as MANDAY. And I was stupid for seeing that AFTER I MADE THE PURCHASE. Oh well time to hit the iStore, where I can buy stuff with my eyes closed and walk out with confidence.	h4untingh0ur	t3_513fur
t3_513fur	t1_d797dei	1473005074	Yeah common in China. I bought my iPhone 6 a few weeks after it was release for around 400 yuan cheaper than it should. Definitely original phone. Not activated ( I checked on apple's website) and can't be refurbished because it was out for a few weeks only. But all the accessories were fake. The earphone was garbage and the  charger broke after 2-3 months.	outragedhain	t3_513fur
t3_513fur	t1_d797tzj	1473005846	Everything real has something to do with the Chinese too. Such an odd world.	flyberb	t1_d7948fu
t3_513fur	t1_d79boin	1473012065	Sometimes people REALLY take care of their devices. Other than that, can't be sure if those are oem parts or not.	initial-e	t1_d791shs
t3_513fur	t1_d79o3r3	1473032871	Lol I doubt there's "new" iPhones anywhere in the world only by collectors man. How much you got it for?	Mrpornogoregrind	t3_513fur
t3_513fur	t1_d79s5pg	1473040305	DAMN.   "How much storage would you like me to label on?"   Holy fuck.	OptionalCookie	t1_d7920y1
t3_513fur	t1_d79xrrv	1473050820	How can you tell if an iPhone has an OEM/Fake/Original part? Would be really great to know.	h4untingh0ur	t1_d79boin
t3_513fur	t1_d79xud5	1473050979	I guess were on the same line but I would never bother using the fake accessories. I got so pissed I threw the box and all the contents that came with it. Just get yourself the original accessories from iStore. It's a surprise they were still selling the 30 pin cable, and so I got that together with the earpods. Don't risk your devices life by using fake accessories.	h4untingh0ur	t1_d797dei
t3_513fur	t1_d7a2f8r	1473063766	They usually have Apple branding on them, but some other factories add that too.	PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES	t1_d79xrrv
t3_513fur	t1_d7a2g42	1473063853	Too bad their shitty cables cost $30. I can get a good quality one for $5 and the OEM earphones for $10 lol.	PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES	t1_d79xud5
t3_513fur	t1_d7a2jb5	1473064179	The Chinese aren't able to clone the logic board...yet. iOS is designed such that only real iPhones can run it. The iPhone 4S is a very good phone for its time, so you shouldn't have any issues if most of the hardware was replaced. Your logic board would be second-hand, but everything on the outside should be new (otherwise you'd be able to tell from signs of wear and tear that the phone's just second-hand and not refurbished.)	vantt1	t1_d7948fu
t3_513fur	t1_d7a35ui	1473066511	Does the phone work at least? Amazon sold me a $79.99 iPhone 4 I gifted my sister last year and it came in crappy packaging but it still worked.	Mrpornogoregrind	t1_d79xkok
t3_513fur	t1_d7a3ug4	1473069107	How to tell if an iPhone 4/4S is original from the outside:  **Screen**: [see how well the LCD is aligned relative to the glass](http://imgur.com/8b9XmUa). Black borders should all be equal in thickness all around. It's easier to see on the white version. Also see if home button is well made and fits perfectly into the screen. Original screens have [barely any color shift](http://imgur.com/a/P4B8D) and great viewing angles too ([closer one is original, the other is aftermarket](http://imgur.com/Bq1mbEk)).  **Earpiece grille**: should be a [fine steel mesh](http://imgur.com/25GhteC). Some aftermarkets are [stamped](http://image.dhgate.com/albu_263368100_00/1.0x0.jpg).  **Front camera**: rarely needs to be replaced, but [if it's off-center](http://imgur.com/8oUgoXE) the screen was most likely replaced.  **Chassis/housing**: check uniformity of polished chamfer and fit and finish in general. [Antenna lines should be precise and flush with the steel](http://imgur.com/7T1iHbQ). SIM slot should be flush. Also check headphone jack trim. [Originals have a discrete ring around it, most aftermarkets do not](http://imgur.com/kSlvLtd).  **Port interiors**: should be color-matched (and clean, if new). [30-pin connector](http://imgur.com/xug4ICi) (notice the water damage indicator), and [headphone jack](http://imgur.com/xug4ICi).  **SIM tray**: the inside of it should have [gray paint](http://imgur.com/rR7nPE7). The underside should have matching IMEI and S/N.  **Back glass/rear camera lens**: [Print should be a perfect mirror finish](http://imgur.com/sOiioM6). Look at the rear camera under white light (a computer monitor/laptop display on a white screen works well) and at about a 45 degree angle. [It should have a purple tint to it](http://imgur.com/EmsyfcF), indicating the presence of an AR coating.  Edit: it's much easier to tell if you take it apart and look at the internals.	vantt1	t1_d79xrrv
t3_513fur	t1_d7a530v	1473073911	Were your accessories fake as well? Yeah the device itself is all good.	h4untingh0ur	t1_d7a35ui
t3_513fur	t1_d7a58t0	1473074487	Thanks!!   EDIT: This would help a lot especially for those who wouldn't risk opening the device itself.	h4untingh0ur	t1_d7a3ug4
t3_513fur	t1_d7a654s	1473077438	That's exactly my concern, the durability on Fake or OEM parts. Im guessing were on the same line. Does the iPhone 4 still work?	h4untingh0ur	t1_d7a35ui
t3_513fur	t1_d7a9yyu	1473086193	Yeah it would be much better if you could tell the difference from the outside without having to disassemble the phone itself.	h4untingh0ur	t1_d7a2f8r
t3_513fur	t1_d7akfyy	1473102815	The only thing that could be fake is the screen if it feels cheap, then you got fucked.   Yeah it works. It's slow as fuck  it it's an old iPhone.	Mrpornogoregrind	t1_d7a654s
t3_51b43f	t3_51b43f	1473103982	I just found my old iPhone 5 from almost two years ago but it won't charge/turn on. Help?	holographic_meatloaf	-1

t3_51b43f	t1_d7am31t	1473105303	Isopropyl is fine (it doesn't cause water damage) and I literally only dabbed a tiny amount on the tip of a toothpick and rubbed it around to clean off any residue.   Yeah I've tested the outlet, cord, and brick with another phone which worked fine.	holographic_meatloaf	t1_d7alfis
t3_51b43f	t1_d7amk69	1473106024	If you plug into iTunes does it do anything?	Sk8r_1995	t3_51b43f
t3_51b43f	t1_d7ammks	1473106127	Nothing on iTunes. The screen on the phone doesn't even display anything, but I think that's because this phone hasn't been charged in almost two years.	holographic_meatloaf	t1_d7amk69
t3_51b43f	t1_d7ao7ff	1473108550	How long have you waited?  I had to wait about 30 minutes for my long unused iPod touch to wake up on the charger.	vkoser	t3_51b43f
t3_51b43f	t1_d7aoeiy	1473108861	I can't tell you for sure, but it's definitely over an hour.	holographic_meatloaf	t1_d7ao7ff
t3_51b43f	t1_d7aofdg	1473108896	Leave it charging for several hours.  Open it. Disconnect battery. Reconnect. See if it charges.  Open it. Disconnect battery. See if it boots with a new battery. Replace battery.  Open it. Disconnect charging port. See if it boots with new charging port. Replace charging port.  Basically, troubleshoot it and rule out elements. Or, pay someone to do it.	my02	t3_51b43f

t3_51b43f	t1_d7asc92	1473115189	I do have the tools left from when I removed the battery and put the new one in, so I can try that. I don't have a spare battery so I guess I have to wait to try that.	holographic_meatloaf	t1_d7aofdg
t3_51b43f	t1_d7asof2	1473115755	Last ditch effort: try unplugging the battery, waiting a bit, and then plugging it back in. This always works for me with MacBooks when I repair them, it should work with the phone too.	BrodoFaggins	t1_d7asaww

t3_51ema2	t1_d7bht8l	1473171460	People should pay attention to OP, his phone is OFF, so looking at battery stats likely isn't gonna help, same with low power mode.	Marino4K	t3_51ema2
t3_51ema2	t1_d7bjab9	1473173736	Please pay attention to the reality of user reports: when talking about a phone being OFF, they usually mean that the screen is off and it's in standby.    Unless the user specifically says that they're powering the phone off (via the shutdown slider, for instance) then it's almost certain just in standby.	Chairboy	t1_d7bht8l
t3_51ema2	t1_d7bjf8i	1473173935	How do you turn it off?  Are you doing a complete shutdown (holding the sleep button several seconds then sliding the 'Slide to power off' button?  Or just pressing the button once so the screen turns off?	Chairboy	t1_d7bic8a
t3_51ema2	t1_d7bjugc	1473174560	Welp, getting any information from you feels like pulling teeth so I'm out.  If you want help, provide more details in the beginning.  If it has to turn into a game of 20 questions, you're doing everything wrong.   Good luck with life.	Chairboy	t1_d7bjkza
t3_51ema2	t1_d7bnihs	1473179704	If someone says OFF, it's not ridiculous to assume that the phone itself is OFF, in fact, I think you're incorrect to think it means screen off, most people would mention screen itself but phone on	Marino4K	t1_d7bjab9
t3_51ema2	t1_d7bp46v	1473181874	It wouldn't lose power if it was actually off. Are you pushing the wake button long enough to actually turn it off? My suggestion still stands.  If the phone is possibly reporting the battery level incorrectly, then you may need a new battery.	Snuhmeh	t1_d7bic8a

t3_51lxbl	t1_d7cxc2u	1473263985	Bestbuy doesn't do T-Mobile so I doubt he can help that much regarding your question.  But to answer it, (assuming you're on the newer version of jump) pay off 50% of the phone then go to the store and tell them you want to jump, they will ship you the 7 and you use the box to ship back the 6s.

t3_51lxbl	t1_d7cxg21	1473264132	Head to your nearest best buy. To preorder it at the store, you'll put down a $50 deposit but basically you're buying a $50 best buy gift card and you'll use that toward any upfront cost when you receive the phone. It's just our way of making reservations, so it'll cost you $50 for the $50 best buy gift card but you'll use it when you pick up the phone.	tjsherod	t1_d7cxbe1

t3_51lxbl	t1_d7cxne7	1473264406	I have a 6s thru Verizon that I purchased 3 months after launch, I still owe 3 payments before I can upgrade. On the Verizon app it says "click here to upgrade early" and shows my balance of 3 payments (around $125) but when I click that it shows my total remaining balance on the phone ( around 499) and keeps asking me to pay that off. When I continue with the purchase it says something like "today u owe 549 and you should expect to see a credit on your account of 300 in the next few billing cycles" is it just doing this because the 7 hasn't been released yet and there is technically no "upgrade" available yet? Or will I need to order over the phone with a rep? I'm just trying to do dry runs because I live on the east coast and will be waking up at 3 am to preorder then going back to sleep and want this to be as painless as possible.

t3_51lxbl	t1_d7cxsj0	1473264594	preorders are done in store. Everything is billed through your carrier like normal. If you do installments through your carrier, sales tax is done in store. No sort of extra cost going through us	tjsherod	t1_d7cxq9j

t3_51lxbl	t1_d7cy29n	1473264956	Dumb question but if my upgrade is on the 19th, can I pre-order a new phone before that upgrade date and still pay the upgrade price? I'm doing the 2-year contract.	bajubiejunior	t3_51lxbl

t3_51lxbl	t1_d7cydnq	1473265376	Are you wanting to get the phone 50% paid off to trade in and upgrade or pay it fully off and keep the 6S and upgrade?	tjsherod	t1_d7cy567
t3_51lxbl	t1_d7cyint	1473265558	Are you wanting to do a 2 year contract or the installments? you may be able to early upgrade if you do installments, and with some plans it can be cheaper in the long run to do the installments. I can explain all of that if you tell me what your plan is and your data size for that plan is.	tjsherod	t1_d7cy8b1

t3_51lxbl	t1_d7cz30w	1473266291	I haven't decided yet everything recently is on installment my phone now was the last with just a contract. I will most likely go the installment route and then pay off the remainder of what I owe left on another device on my installment plan. I have the  new Verizon plan with 16GB of data.	x5AVAG3x	t1_d7cyint
t3_51lxbl	t1_d7d0o2z	1473268344	is there still a charge to upgrade? this will be my first time upgrading through att next	superfastra	t1_d7cxyzq
t3_51lxbl	t1_d7d0rl2	1473268470	It's either $15 or $20 on your bill	tjsherod	t1_d7d0o2z

t3_51lxbl	t1_d7da04d	1473280270	Okay so AT&amp;T has 2 plans for their installment agreements. AT&amp;T Next and AT&amp;T Next Every Year. Every year is a 24 month installment plan with an upgrade after the phone is 50% paid off. Standard Next is a 30 month agreement with an upgrade after the phone is 80% paid off. The 24 month agreement is better for most people. It's 41.58/mo for that. You add on $20 for line access, and then add on data cost. Data has a high speed cap and after that it slows it down.   3 GB $40 6 GB is $60 10 GB is $80  and there's more options. But the formula is the full retail cost of the phone divided by 24 or 30, plus $20 for line access, plus data. So a 6 GB plan with a 128 7 Plus is $121.58/mo.	tjsherod	t1_d7cyx5u
t3_51lxbl	t1_d7da3k3	1473280388	I've never ordered a phone through verizon's website, but i know the way it works in store at best buy is we pull up your number to do an upgrade and it gives us the option to pay up or pay off. Pay up is to get you to 50%, and then we give you an envelope to send the old one back within 14 days. So you'd pay however much in store to get to 50% and then you'd pay sales tax on the new phone, and send the old phone back using our shipping materials.	tjsherod	t1_d7cz2tr
t3_51lxbl	t1_d7da4es	1473280418	What plan do you have and what data size is it?	tjsherod	t1_d7cz2ae
t3_51lxbl	t1_d7da8gj	1473280559	Sometimes sprint gives you a two year upgrade a week or two before your contract actually expires. That way when people get the notification they can upgrade and immediately go and sign another 2 year contract with sprint and sprint doesn't have to worry about people falling out of contract and switching. Best thing to do is call sprint and say you wanna preorder the new iphone but your two year contract isn't up when preorders start. See if they can give you an early upgrade. Might not work but it's something to try. Also sprint does not do 2 year contracts in store anymore, but best buy still does.	tjsherod	t1_d7cyu0i
t3_51lxbl	t1_d7dac4e	1473280687	You most likely should be able to do an early upgrade on installments if you're that close to the end of your 2 year contract from my experience dealing with hundreds of instances like that. If you're currently on a 2 year contract your line access should be $40/mo, on installments its $20/mo. So take the monthly installment amount and subtract 20 from it to see how much extra it will be each month. Installment activation fee is $20, 2 year contract activation fee is $40.	tjsherod	t1_d7cz30w
t3_51lxbl	t1_d7dacpw	1473280707	What plan are you on and what data size?	tjsherod	t1_d7cz2zx
t3_51lxbl	t1_d7dbr1i	1473282477	You can order through Apple 7 days early. I have done this and I am with Verizon. You can also trade your Iphone into Verizon and get a gift card to apply to your bill as well. I am still on the 2 year contract as well.	bobbys360	t1_d7daabw

t3_51lxbl	t1_d7dgvbf	1473289639	So AT&amp;T does their Next plan. 24 month agreement w/ annual upgrade. If your line access is currently $40, the installment does not stack on top of the $40. Your line access will drop to $15 and then the installment goes on top of your that. So if your line access is still $40, then the installments will only be a few dollars a month	tjsherod	t1_d7dcyec

t3_51lxbl	t1_d7dqzm0	1473304982	There have actually been three different versions of JUMP.

t3_51lxbl	t1_d7eal8e	1473348841	I think it's up to your management. iPhone 7 is going to universal carrier device so it's going to be a first come first serve basis as they'll no longer be carrier specific for our inventory and we'll just get sim cards for that carrier. No word on promos.	tjsherod	t1_d7e9dpw

t3_4zt0hp	t1_d7envey	1473365131	Because I've managed to make my 5S last until now. My last two upgrade cycles (I'm on Verizon), I upgraded, and then immediately afterwards Apple released a new goddamn phone. So I managed to make the 5S last until the 7 came out.  Of course, now I'm contemplating getting an SE or something else, perhaps in the hope they'll make an iPhone 7 SE with a headphones jack in the next two years...  Honestly the biggest reason for me to upgrade is storage. I only have a 16 GB version and it makes me feel like a peasant now.	LordRavenholm	t3_4zt0hp

t3_4xhfen	t1_d7fafrq	1473397800	For backing up iPhone on OS X, the best solution can be copying data to a synchronized folder (e.g. Dropbox folder). The alternate method uses  *cron* or other system scheduler (OS X behaviors like a full UNIX clone), but it requires some manual work and knowledge about PC architecture.  If you also have a Windows-powered machine, try some automatic cloud backup solution, like my favorite [Handy Backup](http://www.handybackup.net/dropbox-backup.shtml). Maybe some solution like this are available on OS X but I never heard of something alike.	misterspock1974	t3_4xhfen

t3_51vp5p	t1_d7fat5o	1473398634	I have a 6 plus right now and I'm thinking of trying the regular 7. The larger screen is nice but at times it gets annoying trying to use. At first I hated it for a week then fell in love with it. But laying in bed using the phone or just sometimes gripping the phone feels like I'm stretching my hands or it's just uncomfortable.   If you have a regular 6 try the plus size. You got 14 days to return so by that time you'll know if it's for you. Plus, I'm sure people will have released reviews to see if the camera is that much better.	IAmBPala	t3_51vp5p
t3_51vp5p	t1_d7fbhv0	1473400282	Definitely the plus. The extra screen real estate, battery life, and camera seal the deal. And now that the plus will be coming with 3gb of ram, performance should be even better. It's a no brainier.	-ThuggedOutCubScout-	t3_51vp5p

t3_51vp5p	t1_d7fgpx6	1473417106	I've had a 6 plus and 6S plus but I decided to go with a regular 7 this time.   To be honest the main factor was that it was the model that was available for in store pickup on next Friday. I originally intended to go for a 7 plus at the last minute.   I really love the bigger screen but I'm tired of not really being able to put my phone in my pocket comfortably. Apple still hasn't nailed s good form factor for the larger screen but I'm thinking this is the last generation where that will be the case.   Figured it would be nice to try a smaller phone for the next year until apple comes out with s completely new form factor that hopefully fixes the bezel issue and overall size of the plus models.

I absolutely love the screen size of the plus especially when consuming media or playing games, but I absolutely hate the size of the thing when I just want to shoot out a quick text or look up something real fast while on the go.    The telephoto lens doesn't appeal to me as better zoom is the only benefit it has now that the smaller has OIS. The battery doesn't matter to me too much because I'm always near a charger and can use a battery case when traveling which I only do a couple times a year.    I think between the better battery and OIS im going to go with the 4.7" model this year and give up the larger screen and telephoto lest in favor of one handed use and typing.   Maybe next year if the form factor is easier to grip without a case and has smaller bezels i can go large again	weedwhacking	t3_51vp5p

t3_51ynwu	t1_d7g4fd2	1473452900	Yea it's a shame brexit and Apple removing 64gb despite falling storage cost made it cost over £800 but I'd managed to cobble together £450 and I'm going to save more than double that over next 2 years	bengillam	t1_d7g3oal

I took this quote to EE and they matched the monthly cost Three game me, beat them on data and refunded me some of the upfront cost I paid. I thought competition between UK carriers was dead and although it's not the greatest result my hope was slightly restored today, just goes to show you don't ask you don't get!	joshg653	t1_d7g3oal

Are these conversations using iMessage or MMS? MMS is not synced by iCloud AFAIK, but if the husband owns the cellular plan that the phone is operating on, then he may be able to access them through their carrier.  Also, I am by no means qualified to give legal advice, but I would think that text messaging is not the most secure or private way to communicate with a lawyer.	tdsteve	t3_521h6i
t3_521h6i	t1_d7glxbe	1473481529	I think the concern was that the husband may be able to access them through iCloud, but factory resetting the phone and giving the son his own iCloud account would be a good solution, as long as he doesn't give him the password to his iCloud.	tdsteve	t1_d7glo3r
t3_521h6i	t1_d7gm4o9	1473481970	That's something I hadn't even considered. If he had a copy of the iCloud backup though, he wouldn't want the phone itself so bad.

t3_521h6i	t1_d7gmkuj	1473482985	Not sure, I'll ask her.  I agree with you about communicating with her lawyer via text messages, but what's done is done. She has a new phone to use that she bought herself, it's just the old one that my nephew is currently using.  One other thing, is there a way to securely remove the text messages without a factory reset? My nephew really only uses the phone to play Pokemon Go and he would probably be upset if all his stuff was deleted.	NoAvailableNicks	t1_d7glugl
t3_521h6i	t1_d7gofl2	1473487659	Pokemon Go is an app that uses a login and password to obtain our data. None will be lost by deleting the app itself because he can just login again once it re-downloaded after wipe.	IGotEm	t1_d7gmkuj

t3_521h6i	t1_d7gqemq	1473493831	If her phone has autobackup to iCloud on, all the husband needs to do is buy a cheap older model iPhone (used?) and restore from the cloud to access any info she had previously stored. She needs to wipe her phone and wipe the iCloud backup. When I get a new phone, I always restore from backup from my last phone and all text messages with pictures even, get transferred. Then I wipe my old phone after verifying everything has transferred. Wiping (complete reset to factory) lets me sell the phone. As long as she can access the iCloud account, if all this is too confusing for her, have her take the phone to the Apple Store and ask them to wipe the iCloud account.	ItsDarts	t3_521h6i

t3_521h6i	t1_d7h062e	1473520827	If your phone in question is being backed up to an apple iCloud, laptop or network appliance then yes you can read all messages on the phone for as long as there has been backups.  I work as a digital forensics examiner and messages CANNOT BE DELETED.    Let me explain ELI5  iOS uses a fancy spreadsheet where it keeps application data.   This spreadsheet contains the content of the messages, and the "metadata" or data about the data. Like time sent, received, whom sent the message etc. It also contains links to the photos and other data sent in message.   Now once the message is on the phone and placed in the sheet, it will stay there until it is "marked" deleted. It doesent go anywhere. It's not removed in any way. This message just gets "hidden" from the users view.   Now when you send and receive more messages these "hidden" messages can be overwritten by new messages. But here's the rub. I've seen messages that were marked remain on a phone for months. So they are not entirely gone.   Now when you use iCloud or backup your device. These messages get stored in your backup as a single file. Every time iCloud backs up your data it saves even the marked items to the messages file.  I can easily download all your messages from your iCloud account with 29$ software, and "decode" or unscramble the messages if you will to a nice pretty list you can read as if it were on the phone. With the little bubble windows and all..  The ONLY way to get rid of everything is to factory wipe the iPhone.  This doesent actually delete any data it just removes the keys to the data forever.  Then go to your iCloud storage then manage storage and delete all backups.. Wait there's more ! Now you have to find all computers ever plugged into the phone and manually secure erase every backup. I would use a program @ eraser.heidi.ie and do a 3 pass wipe with pseudo random data.   But be warned. There is a file that is left behind on the phone when you do a factory wipe that tells me if and when it's been wiped! A good forensic examiner will find this file right away.   Hope this helps. And for everyone whom wishes to pick at my explanation of how this works and if messages can be recovered. I suggest you read up on SANS.org about iPhone forensics. There are many resources for you to use to help educate yourself about the process. I was trying to simplify it as much as possible.	nrhyne	t3_521h6i
t3_522vgq	t1_d7h0av5	1473521047	Hopefully with the A10 Fusion core this won't be that necessary!   According to Apple the iPhone 7 can do *wireless* audio for 40 hours and the 7 Plus for 60 hours, wired audio probably much longer.   The real drain will come from using on LTE while listening to audio. The 7 has 12 hour usage time on LTE and 7 Plus = 13.  13/14 hours for video.	owl_majestic	t3_522vgq

t3_522vgq	t1_d7i2o30	1473594094	Both the headphones and smartphone are optional toys that can be bought with disposable income.  If you have $700 this year for an iPhone, you should have $350 next year to spend on headphones.  Or buy the headphones first and then the iPhone next year.  If it takes you longer than a year to save up your disposable income for an iPhone, then you really can't afford it and shouldn't be buying iPhones nor $350 headphones.  Housing and cars aren't bought out of disposable income, but once you finish paying off your house, you could certainly redirect that mortgage payment into paying off a Ferrari.  Or buy the car first and live in a cheap house or apartment, then buy the expensive house afterwards.  &gt; See how dumb you are?

t3_52h5wn	t1_d7k79nd	1473720087	Most carriers do not do contracts anymore. DPP may be cheaper too.	crisss1205	t3_52h5wn
t3_52h5wn	t1_d7k7niz	1473720639	The actual cost of the phone starts at $649. Contract (subsidy) pricing is more or less gone. Carriers would much rather you jump on the new pay x for this many months plans which are now extremely prevalent. You can (try) to call up Verizon and see if they'll do a contract plan for you, but don't cross your fingers.	Stuffonastick	t3_52h5wn
t3_52h5wn	t1_d7k8k9v	1473721969	You can definitely order it for $199 through Verizon, I renewed my Contract for 2 years and paid $299 for a jet black 128gb 7. Straight through Apples site. I LOVE Verizon.	skee323	t3_52h5wn
t3_52h5wn	t1_d7k8rwy	1473722283	have heard some carriers can sign you up for a traditional 2 year contract when done over the phone or in store.   the downside is that some carriers may have surcharges on their plans in lieu of having a contract. mine actually discounts me for having an installment agreement, which brings it to the cost of a normal rate plan plus contract lol	newaptthrowaway	t1_d7k7niz
t3_52h5wn	t1_d7k9ncn	1473723544	Apple Upgrade Program is the cheapest if you don't have a contract. No upfront purchase of the phone, and no extra $20/month for phone &amp; $10/month insurance.	TeaP0tty	t3_52h5wn
t3_52h5wn	t1_d7k9r4t	1473723692	Carrier contracts are a bad deal now. Apple upgrade program is significantly cheaper.	TeaP0tty	t1_d7k8k9v
t3_52h5wn	t1_d7ka2e6	1473724149	Apple upgrade program costs almost double what Verizon's 2 year commitment price costs. I don't plan on leaving Verizon for years to come so it's a no brainer for me. (And to any one that can do the math)	skee323	t1_d7k9r4t
t3_52h5wn	t1_d7kafma	1473724679	No it doesn't. You have been misinformed, or did the math wrong.  Apple Upgrade Program is a 0% interest loan on same price as buying the phone from Apple directly for full price.  Through carriers like Verizon you can purchase the phone for a subsidized price, sure. But that doesn't factor the extra $20/month for your phone vs no-contract plan. Then there is $9/month insurance, surely more expensive than Applecare through the upgrade program.	TeaP0tty	t1_d7ka2e6
t3_52h5wn	t1_d7kaj8l	1473724818	You don't own your phone with the Apple upgrade your program, you are leasing it and returning it every year for a newer one. In order to own it you need to make 24 payments. Which ends up costing you $700+, as opposed to $299 from Verizon. Also I don't pay $20 a month extra for a contract plan or $9 a month for insurance, if I need Apple care I can purchase it through Apple.	skee323	t1_d7kafma
t3_52h5wn	t1_d7kanxq	1473725001	Wrong again.   Its a money loan, not a lease on the phone. You get to keep the phone at the end of 2 years.   But if you choose the free upgrade after 1 year, you will have to trade in your phone.  Carrier contract plans are ALWAYS more expensive than buying the phone in full, which is essentially what you are doing with Apple's upgrade program. With carrier contract, you are definitely paying extra per month, you are just not aware of it.	TeaP0tty	t1_d7kaj8l
t3_52h5wn	t1_d7kawxh	1473725368	You are incorrect. I am not paying extra for it. I just went and reviewed my statements and I am not paying any extra fees. Yes, you get to keep your phone at the end of 2 years, but you end up paying more than double the price that I do.	skee323	t1_d7kanxq
t3_52h5wn	t1_d7kazh1	1473725472	Its not in your statement as a separate charge. They roll it into line access fee to hide it.   Line access fee outside of contract is $20/month, and you pay an additional $15-$20 with contract.	TeaP0tty	t1_d7kawxh

t3_52i8ah	t1_d7krf3g	1473756463	As far as I recall, iPhone subscribers don't net any commission for the seller. Plus, loyalty.

All I thought was "You know where to come to complain but you didn't think to come here and ask when the new one is due."

t3_52i8ah	t1_d7kv1hf	1473768187	&gt;"they make these things break in 2 years"  While people generally abuse the devices, there is strong truth to that statement and I think people's frustrations are downplayed and ignored because of the raging hard-on most people have for Apple.    They force you to update after a certain amount of time if you want up-to-date apps and support, they don't allow you to downgrade to a more stable version of software, and especially with the iPhone 6, the batteries have a shelf life of less than three years, I had to replace mine due to it expanding and almost wrecking the phone. (Over the year and a half of owning the device I've only used the Apple approved chargers)  Technology used to be built to last, now this whole consumer culture has ruined that.  No body is forcing anybody to buy Apple products, yes, but unfortunately this kind of practice has set a industry-wide standard, not just Apple local.	TheyCallHimBrownies	t1_d7kl54q

t3_52i8ah	t1_d7l1609	1473778330	&gt; When people generally abuse the devices,...  No shit if you abuse something it doesn't last very long.

Hardly a hard on, just facts.    &gt; Technology used to be built to last  I don't think that's true, but I do think people "babied" their new, state of the art equipment a lot more than we do today so it did last longer. You're buying a $700 phone and letting it just fall to the ground? I also don't think 5 guaranteed years of compatibility is or was anywhere close to the norm.

t3_52i8ah	t1_d7la3xn	1473789409	Probably because more iPhone people truly love their device (and thus get emotional and/or irrational as fuck about it) whereas most android people just need a phone and 'this one will do I guess'.	asillyfrog	t1_d7l84xv
t3_52i8ah	t1_d7lagbe	1473789828	To be fair to those that stopped paying attention, the new phones used to come out every summer.  It was the iPhone 4s that first debuted in the fall.	PigSlam	t1_d7kkjuu

t3_52i8ah	t1_d7lan03	1473790062	I wonder what the people in the Apple store, Best Buy, whatever carrier stores are told to do.  Around July or August, do they just say "we're not interested in making money, since the new phones will be out fairly soon" or do they say "here's the latest iPhone available."	PigSlam	t1_d7kof3t

t3_52i8ah	t1_d7li2t3	1473799089	5C here and iOS 9.3.5 works just fine. Battery is very aged though and I'm waiting a few days to upgrade to iOS 10 to make sure it's not a 4S situation.	hookyboysb	t1_d7lckng
t3_52i8ah	t1_d7ljix0	1473800866	If I could buy a cheap ass 8GB version I would. I don't store any data locally on my phone, ive had my current phone for 2 years and only have 4GB of data on it including the OS.	JFizDaWiz	t1_d7kyw9z
t3_52i8ah	t1_d7ll22n	1473802890	The best is when the asshole manager at the ATT store lied to me about when the Galaxy s6 was due to to come out when my S4 bit the dust back in February of that year. He told me it was coming out no earlier than June or July and told me that was the regular release schedule.  Now albeit I should have taken the time to actually research the expected release date myself instead of jumping at the note edge (which turned out to be the phone from hell). There still is a certain respect that you would expect from a salesman to not lie to you boldfaced when you at least ask the right questions.  Suffice to say that note edge was the reason I jumped ship from ATT because they refused to work with me and get me out of my 30 month installment plan and all the misinformation they gave me about when they would release me from that without having to pay around $400.	Sirsalley23	t1_d7lan03
t3_52i8ah	t1_d7ll4xg	1473802997	Right but screwing customers by lying or not telling the full story like in my above anecdote is how you lose ppls business.	Sirsalley23	t1_d7lft5p
t3_52i8ah	t1_d7lo384	1473807268	That sucks about your battery, mine is still great. Since I only use it for email it lasts about 3 days on a single charge. Cool to know if I break my main phone (Nexus 6) I can easily transition back to the iPhone 5 until I find something else to buy.	big_orange_ball	t1_d7li2t3
t3_52i8ah	t1_d7lopw0	1473808213	My wife's iPhone 5 and my iPad 4 are slow, but still updated to iOS 10.   How long does android support their devices, again?	andsoitgoes42	t1_d7kyb9v
t3_52i8ah	t1_d7lpws7	1473809964	And yet if they did keep supporting apps and iOS updates for older devices people would still bitch that Apple ruined their phone by making it slow.	Workywork15	t1_d7kv1hf
t3_52i8ah	t1_d7lsbcz	1473813527	Which means the last 6 phones have come out in the fall. And basically all the new features and changes have been leaked for months: waterproof, colors, headphone port gone, bigger camera, two cameras on the plus, same overall shape and size as the 6/6s platform, force touch home button.   I think the most "surprising" thing for me was the improved colors of the screen - since none of the leaks I saw would be able to mention that.	amd2800barton	t1_d7lagbe
t3_52i8ah	t1_d7lsdo8	1473813620	Well a new android device is released like 2 times a month. The more premium devices are more along the lines of 6 times a year (HTC, SAMSUNG, SONY, Huawei, etc). It's hard to get excited every other week with a new android device.	i0BAYi	t1_d7la3xn
t3_52i8ah	t1_d7lwxdn	1473820446	This is what I don't understand. I'm not trying to be a d*ck or rude to you in anyway, I just get how there are so many people who don't understand it.  Like, it happens in so many industries that I just don't get why people don't know that there will be a new version next year/in 6 months etc. TV's, cars, footwear, washing machines, MP3 players, laptops, ANY PROCESSOR - they ALL have yearly releases (if not more frequently). Why do people get so upset that Apple release a new phone each year?!  The ones that confuse me most are the people I've seen who own Android phones and b*tch about Apple releasing a new phone - erm.. really??	southlegend	t1_d7kmnqu

t3_52p3lr	t3_52p3lr	1473832040	Any general tips or advice for a longtime Android user making the switch?	SilentJ87	-1
t3_52p3lr	t1_d7m5rxn	1473840774	My first smartphone was an Android, and it's been that way until two months ago when I made the switch to iOS. What kept me away from iOS was the lack of a file manager, so the first thing I recommend to install is an app called Documents 5(it was pretty much the first app I installed), which gave me back the option to download videos from the net to the photos app, something Safari just can't do.   The mail app works fine for any email services except for gmail, so if you do have a gmail account (I assume you do since you're coming from android), use the gmail app instead of iOS's mail app. Gmail restricts iOS's mail app to only fetch instead of push, so you're not always up to date if a new mail comes in.   This is personal preference, but Google Keyboard was always my keyboard since it was release on Play Store in KitKat, so I've pretty much used Gboard ever since I owned my iPhone. iOS's stock keyboard doesn't suit me. Also, my dictionary was brought over from android (I tend to speak a mix of english and my own native language), so all the words learnt on android is somewhat here as I am given suggestions of words from my native langauge even though I set it to English.   Lastly, just enjoy your iPhone. iOS isn't as customisable as android, but it's an operating system that just works, and I learned to enjoy it.	luqman_sha	t3_52p3lr
t3_51lxbl	t1_d7mbkv4	1473858030	Thanks! I hope, im leaving the state and would like to have my new phone, just a little concerning that its Wednesday and it hasnt moved past processing onto preparing for shipment.	sweetdubbro	t1_d7l3a29
t3_52p3lr	t1_d7mhxjb	1473867382	I didn't even know about Gboard. That's really good because I love Google's keyboard and was going to miss it	SilentJ87	t1_d7m5rxn
t3_52p3lr	t1_d7mk2hp	1473870112	Well I missed now on tap too. With Gboard, it does bring up quick search, not as detailed as now on tap but it works. The cool thing about it though is that you could actually Google up gifs or images and straight away send it in a conversation without the hassle of downloading the gif first, something android is missing	luqman_sha	t1_d7mhxjb
t3_52p3lr	t1_d7mkezl	1473870537	That is really cool. How is the Reddit iPhone app? I currently use Relay on Android	SilentJ87	t1_d7mk2hp
t3_52p3lr	t1_d7mm3dr	1473872617	I'm using the official Reddit app.  I used to use Now for Reddit (aka Reddit Now) when I was on android, and that app packed a lot of features that fit my taste. I asked around on this sub too what client they used for Reddit, some recommended Alien Blue but it was already removed from the App Store when I got the phone. The iPad version is still on the App Store though and by the looks of it, I was in love with that app. Other apps either lack features or lack in the looks department. I gave up in hunting for the perfect app and just gave in to the official one. Turns out it ain't bad. Could've use a couple of improvements here and there but it does what it says and I have no complains.	luqman_sha	t1_d7mkezl
t3_52p3lr	t1_d7mnpw8	1473874635	Nice, I'm sure I'll get used to it. I'm just glad I can still use Google Play Music on the iPhone. I was afraid I might have to look for an alternative. Learning that I can still use the Google services I really enjoy made it seem like a much less riskier thing to try.	SilentJ87	t1_d7mm3dr
t3_52p3lr	t1_d7n6u5w	1473899656	Google Drive might not let you save images to your camera roll. Gmail could only login to Gmail accounts while on android, they support Yahoo iMAP, outlook and other office emails. But Google apps still works better on iOS. On android, there's that constant battery drain from Google Play Services, something iOS doesn't have. As for me, iOS 10 offers the option to uninstall most of the system apps, so I uninstalled Mail, Calender, Apple Music and Maps in preference for Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Maps. I use Spotify to replace the music app however, but I guess that's just personal preference.	luqman_sha	t1_d7mnpw8
t3_52p3lr	t1_d7nhmhv	1473918444	Spotify is great. What sold me on Play Music though is for your 10 bucks you not only get Play Music, but YouTube Music and YouTube Red. It just feels like more bang for my buck, but I do miss some things from Spotify, like how the app is setup.	SilentJ87	t1_d7n6u5w

t3_52p3lr	t1_d7npozi	1473943149	I'm not really sure. I already had GPM when Red came out, so I just got an email saying I was getting that for my $10 too	SilentJ87	t1_d7nl40c

t3_52vxq7	t1_d7nqd9t	1473944445	My card was charged three days ago, and still no update on the order. The only thing that's changed is when I check the status in the my Verizon app it says shipping date 9/14/16, well that's come and gone and still not shipping info.	ObnoxiousPuma	t3_52vxq7
t3_52vxq7	t1_d7nqrv7	1473945175	It's common practice to show customers later shipping times when larges amounts of orders are coming through to cover their ass. Better to surprise someone with a quicker ship time rather than a later.	damstr	t3_52vxq7

t3_52vxq7	t1_d7nx0g0	1473953983	I feel your pain. We ordered two (1 black +, 1 rose gold +) and only the rose gold, which isn't mine, has shipped. Mine is stuck in processing.	DudeBroChad	t1_d7nsh4k
t3_4m60ws	t1_d7nx1o6	1473954027	Actually I have a Nexus 5 and I had a 5S laying around. Thought ill never switch, but iOS 10 is amazing and the 5S seems to be better now so I decided to switch.   My only issues were the display size, rest all is better on the 5S. Also android has some features like file handling which are really awesome. The 4" display is okay and the only time I think about switching back to nexus 5 is when I open YouTube. From what I can see, what I really should get is at least an iPhone 6 but I am a kid and no way my dad gets me that.	AN649HD	t1_d7nvfn5
t3_52vxq7	t1_d7nxe9u	1473954463	Yes! checked last night and still showed as "processing." This morning shows:   &gt;Apple® iPhone® 7 Plus 128GB in Black &gt; &gt;Status: &gt;Your order has been shipped.  Will be here tomorrow. I thought this might happen, same as when I pre-ordered my 6 from Verizon - first shows a later date then sends by release date.	whyd_I_laugh_at_that	t3_52vxq7

I'm hoping that equates to a Friday delivery! Best of luck!	bagsofsand	t1_d7o0oh7
t3_52vxq7	t1_d7o7ooj	1473967073	I ordered the same exact phone @ 2:03AM CST with the same arrival date, mine is still stuck in "preparing to ship" which is what it has said the past few days.

t3_536qka	t1_d7qqjab	1474133231	While you make some good points, I can't help but disagree with this post. I am an avid iPhone user, but lets go over these posts together.  First off, removing the headphone jack is not the same as removing the floppy disc back in the day.  Everyone uses headphone jacks and (while they do have alternative options) there is no real suitable replacement in the industry as of now.  Being waterproof is nice, but is by no means an innovation in the industry and is honestly bot even as protected as some other phones on the market.  Stereo speakers is nice. Again not innovative but still a nice add on. Internal storage has always been an issue with iPhones, and this line is no different. I shouldn't have to pay $129 more for the next storage unit up.  The camera update is a plus, if you get the 7plus.  The 7 has an average camera at best.  Performance. This is where you got me with this post. This phone is running a quad core processor, but not quite up to par with the snapdragon processor in the S7 edge.  All in all, this phone is average at best, missing some key features, and should be regarded as such.  All this being said, I still want the phone, but this subreddit is full of biased posts like this one.	CodyCus	t3_536qka
t3_536qka	t1_d7qqqdf	1474133538	&gt;Waterproof   1) No, not waterPROOF. WaterRESISTANT, which is a world of a difference. It cannot withstand more than 1 meter of water pressure. This is for small splashes. Nothing more.   2) So what? Samsung did this **without** killing the audio jack.    &gt;Stereo speakers   1) See above #2    &gt;32gb base   1) See above #1   2) Apple has been slapping their users in the face with 16 GB for the last year. That they *just* started offering 32 GB is an absolute JOKE.	svk7	t3_536qka
t3_536qka	t1_d7qqvoq	1474133768	Well, I was trying to streamline the situation but I suppose I could also go the other direction and hook some speakers up to the Lightning to 3.5 adapter then enclose that speaker into a cardboard box which also contains an atmospheric microphone and amp which outputs to a 3.5 jack... I might be onto somewhere there.	Popetown	t1_d7qptol
t3_536qka	t1_d7qr7yt	1474134296	You cant compare samsungs speakers to even one front facing speaker. There is no comparison. Also the zoom is available right now on the plus, it is the portrait photo that is not currently available.	Mavendreas	t1_d7qqqdf

t3_536qka	t1_d7qt73e	1474137351	&gt;Performance. This is where you got me with this post. This phone is running a quad core processor, but not quite up to par with the snapdragon processor in the S7 edge.  Benchmarks disagree.  Where are you coming from with this claim?  Everything I've seen has the A10 as the best chip on market now.   One benchmark site as an example: https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/09/14/geekbench-android-a10	4thezulus	t1_d7qqjab
t3_536qka	t1_d7qtwka	1474138436	Not everyone uses the headphones jack though. It's widely used, yes. But not by everyone. Plus Apple includes an adapter to ease this issue.  I could see this being a serious issue if a vast majority of users are constantly charging their phones while trying to use headphones,  but I don't think that's a common occurrence. At least not from what I've seen.	avoicelikealion	t1_d7qqjab
t3_536qka	t1_d7quczz	1474139123	I plug my charge in and my headphone jack in every single day in my car, a 2014 Sentra, and now I cannot do that without spending more money. Its just a major inconvenience and a way for them to make more money off attachments. The 3.5mm jack is the most widely used audio jack on the market. Its a bit ridiculous.	CodyCus	t1_d7qtwka

t3_536qka	t1_d7qwrki	1474142836	I went from android to windows to iPhone. Didn't really want to break from windows phone but Verizon was relentless about not supporting it so I took the plunge. Have really enjoyed my iPhone experience. I had two previous androids that bricked with their new updates and was tired and frustrated that apps wouldn't work after certain updates. I haven't had issues like that wth iPhone. Only real issue I had was my phone would shut off at 26% battery and wouldn't turn back on until I plugged it in, but an update came out and fixed it within a few weeks.	elynnism	t1_d7ql9h8

t3_536qka	t1_d7qxbbs	1474143700	You do realize that even android enthusiasts are aware that apples iOS being built around hardware is much easier to run than an android counterpart right ? Don't write a bullshit post like this and find the flaws. Everything in life has a flaw. Fucking human life has flaws, death, taxes, cancer . Chill out man you sound so damn spoiled writing like this .  Look, I'm a dual android guy and iPhone guy. I'm a sound engineer and having both allows me the best of both worlds especially working in entertainment.   The way Apple hardware delegates to software internally is much easier than android so, as benchmarks show, it's up there with its rival counterparts in android. Imagine having a car with 8 cylinders and weighing over 3,000 pounds, you brag to your friends how powerful and full of torque the transmission is . You see my car which is all electric. On paper you see a weaker transmission, not understanding that by being electric the torque is higher and can keep up with your V8.  These are phones. People here in this sub love to find the cool and easy things about t and talk. Coming here with that attitude doesn't only make you sound like a first world millennial bitching about problems you didn't even knew existed prior to 7 years ago, but worse, it could have been your last thought and shout to the world. If you died the last thing you said to the entire span of human evolution was " this phone is average at best "  Chill my dude. Relax . Don't do it.

You can charge and listen off the lightning cable, and if you are lazy like me, just Bluetooth connect as soon as you get in the car, no pissing about. I have been using that setup for the last 3 years and I can't understand why everyone flipped their toys when Apple removed the headphone jack. I don't think I have charged and listened to my phone at the same time since I got my 6s. And I fly heaps...	blair3d	t1_d7quczz

t3_53cu65	t1_d7s54c1	1474227035	I just spoke to the manager of the Walnut Street apple store in Philly.  He told me that this link isn't a valid link and he's been talking with 15 other managers in emails talking how they aren't accepting any reservations from this link because it isn't actually a valid link that goes through the "workflow" of the website. Apparently it's like a shortcut link and they aren't allowing it. I insisted that other people are using the link and have been across the country for days and he said they are just only recently catching on to it. Doesn't make any fucking sense to me honestly. I don't know how much higher to climb on the corporate ladder to complain about it but I guess I'll just keep waiting for my shipment.	Mahl0n	t1_d7s2f7z
t3_53cu65	t1_d7s67gl	1474228347	That's total BS. I just did this an hour and a half ago. I didn't have an iPhone previously, reserved using the link in the other thread, got the reservation email, canceled my Apple.com pre-order and went in during my reserved block.  They scanned the QR code, got my phone, went through the whole process, got me on IUP and I walked out in 10 minutes. She said nothing about the way I got the reservation, other than being lucky since stocks are so low.	mustbepbs	t1_d7s54c1

I know on iUP I was able to reserve one just after midnight on Friday (technically Saturday) for pickup that morning (7+ 256gb black). Best Buy was aghast that I wanted to cancel my order as I'd lose my spot and have to wait weeks to get it, they even wanted to "call Apple" to confirm their BS, which I'm sure would have just been a pretend call.	aussie_jason	t3_53fu11
t3_53fu11	t1_d7srucj	1474260062	They're backordered in the sense that you can't order one online and expect to get it in less than a couple of weeks.

So if your willing to keep checking in with stores in your area you have a good chance of finding one before one ordered online would get shipped to you.	techieman33	t3_53fu11

t3_53fu11	t1_d7t0xg3	1474287419	Because iPhones are back ordered AT&amp;T stores will not get shipments "everyday". I am a store manager and am not excepting in store for weeks and even then I am only expecting the regular 7 and not the plus for awhile. We don't even have any black or jet black on order. You are better off ordering what you want than calling around everyday hoping they have your model and that someone doesn't beat you to it since they won't hold over the phone for you.	beastkillah	t3_53fu11

t3_53j78r	t1_d7tisva	1474311991	You need to have a postpaid account with one of the big 4 companies to buy a phone for the first few weeks.	thelance	t3_53j78r
t3_53j78r	t1_d7tjbwt	1474312656	Any reason for this? I guess I have been spoiled by Google's Nexus not asking me any questions at all.	digink	t1_d7tisva
t3_53j78r	t1_d7tjl9t	1474312982	I believe its to keep people from purchasing a lot at the same time to resell them.   Requiring a carrier account, they can then link your new iPhone to your phone number so all you have to do is turn the phone on and activate it.	damstr	t1_d7tjbwt
t3_53j78r	t1_d7tjpdz	1474313124	My question is will I be charged a activation fee for going through the Apple upgrade program. Essentially what I plan to do is sell my current 6s plus on eBay that I'm paying monthly via ATT next. Take that money and pay off my current 6s plus &amp; put the remainder towards my new 7 plus. And then go through Apple with their upgrade plan.   I was under the assumption hey are essentially unlocked and att sees it that way. So I would assume no activation fee, I just get the phone and pop my sim in?	Vanimal31	t3_53j78r
t3_53j78r	t1_d7tk17y	1474313538	Good question - I am also under the assumption there is no activation fee since all I'll be doing is popping in the SIM.	digink	t1_d7tjpdz
t3_53j78r	t1_d7tk6ck	1474313718	Yup I tested mine and my fiancés number to verify. On the last screen it says no commitment via ATT. It said you can continue to use your current phone until the new one comes in with directions to activate. I would just pop my sim in.  If I picked ATT next as one of the options and not the Apple upgrade it says I'd have to pay the whole amount probably because my current 6s plus still on ATT next. So this tells me the phones essentially unlocked. So that is how att should see it with the iPhone 7 via the Apple upgrade program. It's like you using one of your phones you have laying around I assume. Or some people when they upgrade they give their kids their old phone and you just swap sims essentially.	Vanimal31	t1_d7tk17y
t3_53j78r	t1_d7tm37e	1474316098	I had a different experience.  When I went to checkout online with the pay full price option when it checked my Verizon account it said I could only do in store pickup. Then since no stores in the area have any in stock I basically couldn't go any further.  This is extremely stupid and frustrating - if I am paying full price for the phone why the hell is it telling me Verizon may require a deposit?	digink	t1_d7tk6ck
t3_53j78r	t1_d7tmb7h	1474316378	Not true. You can buy outright without activating or having an existing postpaid account. You *cannot* however sign up for IUP or the Apple installment plan if you don't activate.  edit: I should have said you can buy outright *in store*. You probably meant online...  -_-	subhuman1979	t1_d7tisva
t3_53j78r	t1_d7tmhn4	1474316604	Yeah, on Apple.com it's not possible but you're right, you can buy one outright without activating if you go to the store.	thelance	t1_d7tmb7h
t3_53j78r	t1_d7tmjnq	1474316672	It's likely to ensure there are enough phones for the carriers at launch. Someone else suggested it was to stop reselling, but they could easily just limit how many each person could buy. I suspect it's more to prevent people on other carriers from buying up all the Verizon phones before Verizon users have a chance to get them.  By the way, you can totally go into an Apple store and buy a Verizon phone outright without having to activate or provide any account information. Otherwise you'll need to wait a few weeks for a sim-free version online.	subhuman1979	t1_d7tjbwt

t3_53uhv9	t1_d7wjh7l	1474490363	The way Apple is doing it is by making a 3D map using the dual cameras on the 7+. It works very similar to how a Kinect does, because the technology is from one of the companies that was behind that. So your best bet on a 7 is to manually blur the background in Photoshop, or Pixelmator on iOS.	Ceedog48	t1_d7wj72d

t3_53uhv9	t1_d7wmbte	1474493923	Good for a phone, but not going to impress many people w DSLRs and good lenses.  The bokeh it produces is rather meh.	Callate_La_Boca	t3_53uhv9

t3_53uhv9	t1_d7woaq8	1474496560	If you look at some good lenses and the bokeh you can get even with a nifty 50, you'll see that this is ok. And pretty good when you just have your phone.  No need to go all neckbeard accusatory just bc you don't know jack about photography. It's not that complicated, especially here where we are discussing this specific topic of depth of field and how it's simulated on this new piece of technology.	Callate_La_Boca	t1_d7wo47l

t3_53uhv9	t1_d7wplpa	1474498376	Of course this bokeh won't be completely like a DSLR but having used it, it's quick and can produce very nice images.	Crypto-	t3_53uhv9
t3_53uhv9	t1_d7wsys6	1474503327	I was so ready to hate this by the side by side images on display here are lovely. 1000x Better than the image Apple chose to use in the keynote.   Seriously that first image they showed, the fake out one, had to be the worst way to display a depth of field effect.	Portatort	t3_53uhv9
t3_53uhv9	t1_d7wxpsv	1474510479	The pic in the example just looks like what you can already with "Focus Pixels" since the 6. I was sort of expecting a little more impressive bokeh.	rtmc09	t3_53uhv9
t3_53uhv9	t1_d7x0i9g	1474514610	For sure, I don't think Apple is intending to compete with the DSLR.  They are just trying to make those pictures you take with your phone better.	JoJack82	t1_d7wmbte

t3_540zis	t1_d7y1rfb	1474581058	Make the jump, my friend.  What you said about Apple knowing what direction they want to go is absolutely spot on. Their implementation of new features and/or constant updates of old features is what separates Apple from the competition, IMO..The iPhone 7/7+, in their current forms, are absolute powerhouses, but you still get the feeling that some of the best features are still in their infancy and have a ton of room to grow into absolutely irreplaceable aspects of the user experience. Things such as the haptic engine and 3D Touch are already incredible, but will only get better once they are opened to 3rd party developers or improved by Apple via OTA updates.. That's an exciting feeling to me, and something that I feel is often missing from the android experience. Having to wait 6-8 months for an update on certain phones/firmwares/software is just brutal.   Also, If you compare just the specs, most flagship android phones will blow Apple out of the water on paper (RAM, CPU cores, battery mAH, etc.) , but you will find that when it comes to actual performance, ease of use, battery life, stability and support, Apple is King by a landslide. On the contrary, When it comes to customization, expandable memory and replaceable batteries, android wins hands-down..If customization is important to you, you'll definitely want to Jailbreak.   With all that said, I think once you get your hands on the 7+ and get acclimated to iOS 10, you won't want to go back. Good luck, and Godspeed.	Fink41	t3_540zis

t3_540zis	t1_d7y2kjq	1474582218	S6 to the se. The lack of the dedicated multitask and back button(that can return to the home page) at the bottom of my s6 is missed. It's nit picky but I don't like pressing the home button so many times. I don't like how you can't delete app cache, I have to delete instagram and reinstall to clear the space.  Lack of notification LED and no notification symbols at the top of the screen's status bar is a bummer too.  Those are small things that aren't necessary but it's surely missed by me. I'm cool with it in the end though, I think ios holds its own against android.   I'll jailbreak  after my warranty goes though and it should be even better	hopelessromantic217	t3_540zis
t3_540zis	t1_d7y2mhb	1474582294	Welcome to the Apple Ecosystem - It's a great place to be! I, like you, am getting (back) on board, after using an Android device for a few years. When I was younger, I jumped ship to Android because I loved the customizability and freedom - I could swap out widgets, torrent on my phone, copy movies from my PC and play them without converting to MP4. But as time passed, I missed the overall user experience of iOS. As powerful as flagship android devices are, the UI stutters leave much to be desired. I feel that the performance degradation on my HTC One has been greater than on any other device I've used. As (overly)simplistic as many people find iOS, they really aren't kidding when they say, "It just works". Market fragmentation between Android devices really does negatively affect the user experience, and after dealing with keyboard lag and UI stuttering, I cannot wait to get back to an iPhone.   In addition to no longer being as interested in customization and rooting my device, I'm also looking forward to the ecosystem. Most of my friends and family use Apple devices, and iMessages, facetiming, and air dropping are all useful features. Hardware wise, I agree with you. I'm not well-versed with the Nexus 6P, though I know that being a nexus device, you get stock android and don't have to deal with all the bullshit bloatware I've accumulated on my HTC One. As beautiful as the unibody aluminum on the HTC is, Apple always has quality hardware. I know it's unfair comparing an older phone to a brand new one, but even at launch the HTC One camera was lackluster when compared to the competition... although I supposed that flaw is more specific to my phone rather than Android as a whole.	dantat	t3_540zis

t3_540zis	t1_d7y355y	1474583055	I bought my first iPhone this week (7+). I have always had android. So far I love this phone. And once I'm able to jailbreak it, I will be 100% satisfied. I say you do get it. At least try it for a week.	ARVINLOCOx	t3_540zis
t3_54102y	t1_d7y3tkc	1474584044	my original date was oct 7th - oct 14th but I got my email and tracking number today for delivery tomorrow but my daughters phone, same plan,  ordered 6 minutes after mine is still pending shipment.  days not over, hopefully hers will ship today as well. I got the 7+ black 256, she got the silver 7+ 256.  We ordered on the 10th, early in the afternoon	littleclever	t3_54102y
t3_54102y	t1_d7y49hu	1474584691	Got a text, an email AND a tracking number just now for the same model. Ordered on 9/9 at 12:08pm PST from AT&amp;T and had an original delivery window of Oct 7-14. Mine's shipping from Texas and should be here tomorrow. Which means I'm wholly unprepared for its arrival because hello unexpected, but cool dood.	stuffedtomatoes	t3_54102y
t3_54102y	t1_d7y4bk2	1474584778	Same here, 256 matte black shipped and will be here tomorrow!	coolaaron88	t3_54102y
t3_540zis	t1_d7y5bvg	1474586303	Go for it man, switch over :)   I currently have a Nexus 9 tablet and use it time to time but I'm primarily on my iPhone anyway.  I'm currently on iPhone 6S 9.3.3 jailbroken, and I'll tell you now i see it as Android and iOS combined when jailbroken. Don't get me wrong, I like Android and appreciate it and all, it just prefer iOS. Given iOS is slowly becoming more open (with 3rd party apps) as stock i'm positive you'll enjoy it. If you have any questions about Jailbreaking let me know but to answer your current one, Jailbreaking does add a lot to the iPhone/Apple ecosystem. Very user friendly as well with a great UI for Cydia (could still be improved though). You can support developers by purchasing tweaks and majority of them hear your call if there's an issue with it as well. There's no jailbreak for the 7 atm, but its been jailbroken. Just not released so there will be a wait fo rit. Overal, my phone has approximately 30 Tweaks and my phone has not slowed down at all. You can make your iPhone similar to an Android device with these tweaks including themeing and the like. I've been jailbreaking since the iPhone 3GS and don't ever regret it. Come over to /r/jailbreak we're happy to help there as well!  For your google ecosystem, Apple is very welcoming with that as well. I've read a lot of people here who primarily use Google apps on their Apple devices with no issues at all.   For performance, I really don't like shaming Android for this but their software is used by too many devices so its hard to make it 'perfect' like Apple does for their line of devices which explains (imo) why iPhones have a smoother experience with less stutter with animations and the like.   THE one issue i have with iMessage is when I have my Data turned off, I'm from the AU so we don't really have large Data plans.. I've used up mine and when out and about I rely on Wifi networks if I can find one. So if friends message when (who have iPhones via iMessage) I sometimes don't get it. I'm not sure 100% if this is because it doesn't switch over to SMS correctly or if it just doesn't do it. Maybe someone here can give you more insight on that.   Let us know how you go! We're always curious to know peoples experiences :)	blakforest	t3_540zis
t3_54102y	t1_d7y5hsm	1474586559	I told myself that it'll arrive late so I won't be disappointed and just as it settled in, it shipped. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯	air_breezy	t1_d7y1d77
t3_540zis	t1_d7y5qhq	1474586934	So far, it's been great. Last longer than my old Galaxy S6 Edge plus. Maybe 40% more.	ARVINLOCOx	t3_540zis
t3_540zis	t1_d7y87kj	1474590742	Except it's a pain to upgrade a jail broken phone.	Dumasta96	t1_d7y0gez
t3_540zis	t1_d7yf8v2	1474601149	I jumped ship a year ago, and haven't considered looking back once.   Things I love: 1. Battery life. I was able to get some good battery life doing various things on my rooted Android phones but iOS does really good at managing juice.  2. Speed.  3. Camera, especially low light and now RAW functionality (some android phones are really good too though especially the 2015 and 2016 phones) 4. App Store - apps tend to be of higher quality, less junk than Google Play's selection. The App Store has far less free apps though. Developers tend to create and focus on iOS apps first, then Android.  5. The Google experience. Ironic but Drive, Sheets, Photos, Hangouts, etc run really well on iOS.  6. Content blocker. Available on rooted Android devices and in certain browsers but the way it's implemented in iOS is nice.  7. Updates.   Things I don't miss: 1. Carrier and manufacturer circlejerking over software updates. Verizon and Samsung were the worst. No, actually Verizon and HTC were the worst.  2. Bloatware not only from the manufacturer but also from the carrier. 3. Redundant software that can't be removed. Looking at you Samsung, with S-Voice and My Magazine.  4. Random battery drain even when the screen is off. To be fair Marshmallow and Nougat have probably addressed this.  5. Lag. I've used Android devices since 1.6 and the lag did get better with each release and each new device I bought but in general I don't have this issue on my iPhone.  I thought I'd miss expandable memory and the ability to swap batteries as this was always one criticism I had of iOS devices but within the past few years a lot of Android phones have moved to this as well.	PSclosetheboarders	t3_540zis
t3_540zis	t1_d7yfd72	1474601339	My last was an iPhone 4, then got an S3, then S6 edge, now back to the iPhone 7 plus and will be selling it next year to get the 8 (or whatever they call it).  If you are really keen to stay on android, see what pixel has to offer, however I am really liking my move back to the iPhone 7.  Note: I have never been diehard against either android or apple (I have always had my mac and ipad as well)	AreOverIt	t3_540zis

t3_542tx5	t1_d7ygexb	1474603118	Working now! And woah that's about the biggest difference I've seen, I suppose most comparisons compare the 6s plus to the 7/7 plus though	MrDerpyPanda	t1_d7yg785
t3_540zis	t1_d7ygezt	1474603121	I made the switch right before the 5c release. I had numerous android phones (work in IT and managed our cell account) and would love them for a month before they went to shit. I finally took the plunge and haven't looked back!	iheartnjdevils	t3_540zis
t3_540zis	t1_d7yhon8	1474605632	As a android user, what's so special about imessage?	Gandalf_the_gray1	t1_d7xysu8
t3_540zis	t1_d7yisrw	1474608122	Works with Mac's seamlessly. You can draw, send pictures, play games and so on. I held a conversation with my wife today just using the watch + iMessage.  And it *just works* with all iPhone users which is 80%+ of the people I know. I don't know many android users except people getting burner level android devices like my parents and they don't care about fancy messages anyhow.	barjam	t1_d7yhon8
t3_542tx5	t1_d7yjncs	1474610265	I've seen other comparisons, but this is by far the most drastic one. Same lighting conditions for both? I'm not calling you out for lying or anything, but it's incredible how much of a difference there is.	c0ded_truth	t3_542tx5
t3_540zis	t1_d7yk6qd	1474611765	You can send large images and videos easily! You know that your message got delivered. If someone's phone is off, you will know, because it will not get delivered. You can send messages anywhere in the world, no international SMS or mms fees. You can see when someone is typing. You can easily record audio clips, and when you receive one, you just hold the phone to your ear and it will play. Then, if you'd like to reply, you can hold it to your ear a second time and start recording, and it will be sent the second you lower your phone. You can basically have a conversation, but at your leisure. iMessage is far better than SMS.	shao3m	t1_d7yhon8
t3_540zis	t1_d7ykx8q	1474613926	Actually Microsoft word flow keyboard is better than gboard since it's without the crappy google aspect. But has most of the same feature.	ItsKai	t1_d7ygayb

t3_542tx5	t1_d7ym24i	1474617682	That's because the 6S does not have OIS, where the 7 does... Compare the Plus models and the image will be the same.	iammodbox	t3_542tx5
t3_542tx5	t1_d7ymgll	1474619143	I doubt it would be the same. The 7 plus has a 1.8 max aperture which is almost a full stop wider than the 2.2 in the 6s plus. The difference would probably be less drastic but there would be a difference.	jackattacck	t1_d7ym24i
t3_540zis	t1_d7you3c	1474627774	Keep in mind whatever phone he gets (mainly if it's a 7) is likely to be running. iOS 10 which doesn't have a jailbreak out yet	funkymustache	t1_d7xysu8

t3_542tx5	t1_d7ytawd	1474637620	I think the plus is too big, as do many others. So a comparison between phones that we would choose is better than a comparison of phones we would not.	SaberHamLincoln	t1_d7ym24i

All the Google apps work, it's blazing fast, iMessage is great and my battery life is much better then my 6P. The camera is great, and honestly I should have switched before.	tmhiott	t3_540zis
t3_540zis	t1_d7yugyi	1474639447	I made this post here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/4kje0j/anyone_switched_from_android_recently/d3fxrg2  I say this though: get an iPhone, and just keep your old Android around. When you run into a file you want to download, and the iPhone is giving you the piss, just whip out the droid and download that file like God intended.  Regarding your questions:   Jailbreaking will never give you the Android experience, no matter what anyone tells you. Take it from a hardcore Android user for years who ran custom ROMs to overclock, and customize my phone to death.    Cydia is a shitshow. People who use it will disagree out of spite, but then they haven't been to XDA, where ROMs might be supported for iterations with a full docket for questions. Cydia is full of outdated apps, and when a new iOS version comes out, developers don't update quickly enough. With Android at least you have compatibility mode. A bad tweak can send your iPhone into a tailspin. Not being able to boot, forcing a restore.     *Not my idea of a good time.*    The hardware is actually pretty great. The 6S camera ain't shit compared to my Note5, but the front facing camera is on point. Admittedly, the Nexus 6 is a 2 year old phone. The hardware is going up at exponential rates!    If you used the file manager to download any files you used, that will be missing entirely in iOS. You have been warned! Again, I do say dual wield! I have an iPhone AND an Android.    If your phone can't send an SMS, you might be having data issues with the carrier. iMessage is like WhatsApp for Americans since overseas, no one knew what iMessage was. Whatsapp uses data to send messages, entirely. iMessage uses data to send messages w/ an SMS fallback. My sister has an Android and we can text each other just fine.     I paid for my iPhones upfront. I didn't get Applecare since I am actually an authorized repair person, and I wouldn't need it. If you intend to change carriers often, I would pay for the iPhone in full (just save your money), so you can get an unlocked version, get Applecare+, and then take out lost &amp; theft insurance on the phone.

t3_542tx5	t1_d7yv3t5	1474640379	Gotta be honest, the 7 still has a lot of noise it's just lighter. It actually feels like the 6s captures the actual mode of the room a lot better, while the 7 just seems to blow out the highlights to make it brighter. To my eye they have the same level of noise though.	thebuggalo	t3_542tx5
t3_540zis	t1_d7z3p6h	1474651419	Whatsapp or telegram doesnt work like that? I see that iMessage is just... A Whatsapp for iboys o.O.	Discuter	t1_d7yk6qd
t3_540zis	t1_d7zrxwf	1474689334	It has similar features to some extent, but differences aside, I think the biggest advantage is that it works out of the box and all your contacts with an iPhone will automatically send and receive messages with iMessage. It's not a separate app. It's the same app you use for texting your android buddies. When you go through your message list, you won't be able to tell at first glance if someone is using iMessage or SMS until you go into a conversation and see the colour of the chat bubbles.   For me, many of my contacts use iMessage. So it just works. No need to ask them to install an app. I installed telegram earlier and out of my 300 contacts, only two people were on it	shao3m	t1_d7z3p6h
t3_542tx5	t1_d7zs7mo	1474689906	Did you manually set the exposure to be identical between both phones? Because software could just cause the 7 to crank up the shutter speed and ISO to compensate more heavily.   To actually make a comparison here, make sure you click the same location for focus and exposure, then manually adjust to the same brightness. Then take the shot.   Otherwise you aren't really comparing anything, especially not overall picture quality.	Flacvest	t1_d7ytawd
t3_548nd2	t1_d7zse5f	1474690299	If it gets worse and starts to separate they will either replace or fix the phone.	Nasjere	t3_548nd2
t3_548ls6	t1_d7zsefb	1474690314	I had my iPhone 6 and iPad Pro downloading/installing the 10.1 beta and my iPhone 7 and 7 Plus downloading the 10.0.2 update. The Plus made the most noise, followed by a barely audible sound from the 7 and nothing from 6 or iPad. While annoying, it's only an issue if you let it. I can tell you that my Surface Pro 3 makes WAY more noise doing updates. I can hear that beast across the room.	cliffr39	t3_548ls6

t3_548ls6	t1_d7zt0h0	1474691663	I hadn't noticed it on other 6 Plus or 6S Plus but I did hear it the other day on my 7 Plus but it wasn't in a case and to be completely honest I was downloading a lot of music from iCloud at the time and the hiss noise was hardly noticeable, I had to put it up to my ear and it was the kind of sound a sea shell makes when you put it up to your ear, but very feint.  I wouldn't have noticed it otherwise.  Sure if you wind up the cores then it might get louder but it hasn't bothered me one bit.  I haven't tried recording a video yet.	DaveFalcon73	t3_548ls6

t3_548ls6	t1_d7zumhj	1474695688	I think a very large percentage of 7 pluses have this issue. I tested all the 7 pluses in my Apple Store and they all had it. I'm waiting to see what Apple has to say about it before I decide what I'm going to do.	MusklesTheBodacious	t3_548ls6
t3_548nd2	t1_d7zv5ir	1474697177	It's a pretty common problem with the 5S. 6/10 of my friends who had the 5S (including me) had this problem. The adhesive that holds the plastic frame and the screen is drying up and causing it to lift. You'll need to readhere or get a new screen.	PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES	t3_548nd2
t3_548nd2	t1_d7zvf3h	1474697980	I'm smelling poor quality control here. Thanks for the input!   EDIT: I think the overheating (the part where i had to charge my phone overnight allowing it to get warm) allowed the adhesive to soften thus popping the screen loose.	h4untingh0ur	t1_d7zv5ir
t3_548nd2	t1_d7zvkq2	1474698463	By the way, if you don't mind me asking.. How's your 5s doing? Is it still in great working condition despite the adhesive issue? Did the screen lift even more?	h4untingh0ur	t1_d7zv5ir
t3_548nd2	t1_d7zwfxa	1474701306	It slowly raised over the period of the year. Dust got into the front camera but it didn't affect the equality. I've since replaced the screen though.	PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES	t1_d7zvkq2
t3_548nd2	t1_d7zwiss	1474701586	Damn now I'm thinking of giving the phone back since its still under warranty. Sucks how the people at the Apple Store wouldn't do something about it.	h4untingh0ur	t1_d7zwfxa
t3_548nd2	t1_d7zxfnh	1474704872	I had the same problem on a 5S and a colleague had the same problem before me on the 5.  We both took them into an Apple Store and they replaced them free of charge.  It's not a design flaw per se, it's the glue holding the phone on hasn't stuck properly and is faulty so you should get a replacement.  If the battery is bulging then you would see the top half or bottom half of the screen coming away and it would look a lot worse.  Take it back to the store and say you aren't happy with it, it's a brand new product you've purchased and it's faulty.  If Apple won't swap it then you should take it back to the Apple Reseller where you bought the phone and request a refund.	DaveFalcon73	t3_548nd2
t3_548nd2	t1_d7zy9i1	1474708127	Hi! Update: I went to the authorized apple reseller store where I bought the iPhone and  they wouldn't replace/repair the phone and told me that all apple products bought from their store should be taken at Power Mac Centre for warranty (Apple Service Store here in the Philippines) for any issues regarding the apple product. And so I did.  When I got to Power Mac Centre, they checked the iPhone and refused to take the phone in for repair or replacement since according to them, the "spongy loose issue" on my phone was a "common one" for all iPhone 5/5s. The loose corner on my 5s is not really noticeable or visible and is only noticeable once you press it firmly, probably the reason why they refused to take the phone in for repair.  But they did assure me that if the problem gets worse (ex. screen starts separating etc.) then I can take my phone in for repair or replacement under warranty at no cost. I left the store with a lot of unresolved questions. So much for store policy.   If all of this occurred in the U.S, I would have been enjoying my replacement phone with no loose corners 24 hours ago. The service I got from both stores were really unexpected. Not exactly how I expected things to turn out.	h4untingh0ur	t1_d7zxfnh
t3_548nd2	t1_d7zyd75	1474708558	Dropped by at an Apple Store to test the demo units (5S and SE) if there were any loose corners on the phones. Turned out every unit DID have the "spongy" corner. The loose corner on some devices were faint and on the others it was terrible asf.  And that's where the alarms started going out lmao. So much for checking loose corners.	h4untingh0ur	t3_548nd2
t3_548nd2	t1_d7zymb7	1474709592	Hmmm don't know what legal recourse you have in Philippines but in UK and US you have comeback and the retailer must either offer a refund or replacement.	DaveFalcon73	t1_d7zy9i1
t3_548nd2	t1_d7zz32r	1474711432	Most of the stores here normally offer a replacement or repair under warranty (refund is rare) but after-sales service usually sucks in most stores in this country. There have been a lot of horror stories about unit being taken in for repair under warranty usually taking more than 5 months or no feedback at all, defective replacement after another defective replacement and the like. Don't get me wrong there are also stores here that offer great after sales service just like most countries but overall, the negative tops the positive.  PS: to add to the horror story. no luck. I've been to three "apple service stores" already and all the staff from the two stores did was refer me to another "apple service" store which is a 40 minute drive from the store. And not to mention diagnostic test for the iDevice WOULD TAKE 3 TO 4 WEEKS. JUST TO CHECK IF THE BATTERY IS WORKING FINE. I decided to keep the phone to myself and just get over it lmao. Warranty is considered useless. Oh and did I tell you how clueless they were when I started showing them the phone? All of them were of no help in regards with the loose corner issue.	h4untingh0ur	t1_d7zymb7
t3_548nd2	t1_d7zzgw4	1474712937	Had my 5s since right after launch, never even noticed this till now. I'm not exactly careful with my phone, and it's never been an issue.	afd33	t3_548nd2
t3_548nd2	t1_d8001ko	1474715126	Glad to hear! I guess I'll just have to deal with this one for now then. But I do know someone who had an iPhone 5 that had a slight loose corner in it until around 8 months later the screen started to separate from the body ENTIRELY that you could see what was on the inside lmao	h4untingh0ur	t1_d7zzgw4
t3_548ls6	t1_d803clm	1474724217	Tested a few 7+ today at store too, all that I tested have it.  I had exchanged a new 7+ few days ago and the new one has it too. Apple store guy told me today they received email regarding this hissing issue and was told to report them, didn't sound like they have any clear instructions yet as to what to do with us, as I was told to wait for more information, like maybe a week then contact Apple Care again.  At this point, it's either a design flaw, or only certain batches have problems. If it's widespread, are they really going to recall? Or a software patch might fix it?  The hissing is affecting calls quality too when making calls.	lemonever	t1_d7zumhj
t3_548nd2	t1_d807xlh	1474732507	They should. It's a pretty known defect. Just keep trying.	PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES	t1_d7zwiss
t3_548ls6	t1_d808lcf	1474733529	Thanks!  Looks like I'll be waiting a little while before getting the 7+.	RedOSRed	t1_d7zu0im
t3_548ls6	t1_d80adnz	1474736234	I originally thought it wouldn't be a big deal, that it was something I could live with as I assumed you would have to really listen for it in order for you to notice. As I was downloading a few apps onto my phone, I definitely heard it when I was browsing reddit, holding the phone a normal distance away. It was slightly bothersome, but I am hoping it will either sort itself out after a few days, or Apple will come out with a replacement program.	sagelink	t3_548ls6
t3_548nd2	t1_d80cd82	1474739172	Thanks. I surely will. This is going to be a noob question but uhm... my iPhone is still under one year warranty and can I have it replaced/repaired under warranty in any apple store or premium apple reseller stores nationwide? Since the store I got it from is an hour ride from where I'm currently staying.	h4untingh0ur	t1_d807xlh

t3_54b70b	t1_d80d149	1474740176	It's actually a feature. If you go to your notifications you can choose between the usual disappearing banner, or an alert, which stays until you manually dismiss it or interact with it.	feggatron	t3_54b70b
t3_54b70b	t1_d80d4ir	1474740321	I have the regular disappearing alert enabled, not the sticking one. And as I said it only happens occasionally. Across different things (iMessage, FB) all which have the disappearing notification selected.	orangebalm	t1_d80d149
t3_54b70b	t1_d80dgfk	1474740826	It's been happening to me since beta 5 on my iPhone 6+. It can be annoying because it'll just sit there sometimes until you manually dismiss it. It's random, too.	cryptic0913	t3_54b70b
t3_54b70b	t1_d80du7p	1474741401	Yeah exactly. Wish I could swipe up to hide like on 9. :(	orangebalm	t1_d80dgfk
t3_548ls6	t1_d80edvh	1474742239	I would too. I contacted apple and they're sending me a new replacement but if the problem still exists I'll probably wait a month before going back to them with it and hope it's fixed by then.	shadow82x	t1_d808lcf

t3_54b70b	t1_d80n7o2	1474756494	My banners for clash of clans and boom beach act as alerts as well. They will not go away until manually dismissed. It happens roughly 25% of time on my message notifications as well. Pretty annoying.	chinastevo	t3_54b70b

t3_54b70b	t1_d80o4ga	1474757953	That's odd that you can't. On my iPhone 6+ when it got stuck like that and wouldn't go away I was able to just swipe it up and it would go back whence it came lol   I just got my 7+ today so haven't seen it happen yet but if it does I'll give an update on whether I can swipe up to get rid of it or not.	cryptic0913	t1_d80du7p

t3_54ctsj	t1_d810kbj	1474780709	Very nice. I got the matte black Plus with the midnight leather case. I'm kind of wishing I went with the black leather. However, I think I'm gonna get a Speck grip case for daily use. I'm not used to the Plus-sized iPhone. When trying to use it with one hand I'm constantly fumbling around with it. The leather doesn't give too much grip, but it looks amazing, it's pretty damn sturdy considering it's leather, and it very slim —just don't drop it on pavement (the rocky sort). I dropped it once and it tore apart more leather pretty good.	DPool34	t3_54ctsj
t3_54ctsj	t1_d810rt3	1474781215	Apple.com. I ordered around 11AM that day. October 4-10th estimate. I am probably just being impatient though.	CheesyWhales	t1_d810ftm
t3_54ctsj	t1_d810thb	1474781328	I have the same estimate. Ships by 10/7. Jet black.  My first order was a mistake for a 7 non plus. I got that last week and returned it.	doggscube	t1_d810rt3
t3_54ctsj	t1_d811xpa	1474784315	I'm with you. Especially since the jet black is so grippy. I was more afraid of carrying my 6S Plus without a case cause it was slippery. This one isn't at all. And after one week of use without a case, I don't notice any micro abrasions.	prisonhistoryguy	t1_d80w8ke

t3_54ctsj	t1_d812xm2	1474787401	I've always had problems with the leather version of these cases. I found it scratched so easily. Since then I have changed to the apple silicon one. Is this one any better or is it as likely to scratch as if leather?	andrew_pretty	t3_54ctsj

t3_54ctsj	t1_d813l6o	1474789582	Never put a case on either of my iPhones (4s &amp; 6s) and have no regrets, they're both in pristine shape. Just keep it in a separate pocket away from keys, don't go to the beach with your phone, and don't drop it.	KuKuMacadoo	t1_d80w8ke
t3_54ctsj	t1_d813nce	1474789786	It still scratches but it depends how you use it or lay it down on a table. Don't go laying it on a surface full of grain particles/ small metal pieces etc and it'll be fine. I'm not saying you should baby your phone but yeap, I haven't had many issues with the scratching. Besides, they put on a 'self healing' wax to allow it to 'recover' from light marks. Reasons why I don't like the silicone cases are the buttons' tactility not being as good and that the bottom 2 front corners chip easily when you take your phone out from the case a few times (to clean and wipe down the phone).	SJUNLIN	t1_d812xm2
t3_54ctsj	t1_d813shf	1474790297	Cheap case on engineering masterpiece )) looks like luxury interior in the ford counter. Why would you guys put something like that on your phones, so phony)) just pay freaking 100$ to replace screen once in a few years if you drop your phone often and enjoy gorgeous design! And btw if you worry about scratches wrap you car in leather as well ) Imagine anybody from apple leadership walking with these cheap cases.	iKoshee	t3_54ctsj
t3_54ctsj	t1_d814clj	1474792357	Its covers the bottom corners and has a lip on the bottom. You can put your phone down upright and the phone is still protected, as well as all four corners.	Mrcool360	t1_d80qva7

t3_54ctsj	t1_d81557s	1474795479	Got this case yesterday and love the look and feel of it (my god it feels so good in the hand).

t3_54ctsj	t1_d81agz4	1474812300	I agree. The 6s/6s+ leather cases are slippery. After a few weeks, it isn't as slippery. I prefer leather to silicone because the silicone is a dust magnet, hard to put in/take out your pockets and starts to shimmer over time (it's matte in the beginning, but it starts to get shiny). I will be ordering the Apple leather case for my 7 Plus.	Godrillax	t1_d8181i4

t3_54ctsj	t1_d81cjjo	1474816207	The inside of the case is exactly like the leather, it has microfiber lining, so you don't want to wash it. Wiping it down will help prevent the shimmer. But even after wiping it down, it will attract dust again.	Godrillax	t1_d81bibx
t3_54ctsj	t1_d81cmm8	1474816355	If you don't like it, go into an Apple store and exchange it for a leather one. A few of my buddies did that.	Godrillax	t1_d81bgkr

t3_54b70b	t1_d81hlp3	1474824045	Well, I was beginning to think it wasn't going to happen on my iPhone 7+ but it just did. Decided to wait a couple of minutes before taking a screenshot of it. I was on the FB app and my classmates have been going back and forth via an iMessage group. All the notifications were going away on their own but then this one randomly decided to stay up.   [Notification bug](https://imgur.com/a/iFOqj)   After two minutes I took a screenshot and then I swiped up on it to dismiss it. About a minute later another one came in (from the same person as in the screenshot) and it went away on its own like it normally would.   This is the same behavior I experienced in iOS 10 on my iPhone 6+ but I can't really figure out what's triggering it.	cryptic0913	t3_54b70b

t3_54ctsj	t1_d8296f8	1474863379	I just got the jet black plus with the saddle brown leather case today. Just a hint of the polished black near the camera lens. It's sleek looking. I'd take pictures, but idk how to take pictures of my phone with my phone...	CommanderClit	t3_54ctsj
t3_54ctsj	t1_d82cd4y	1474870866	https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/54c8yi/the_iphone_7_matte_black_apple_saddle_brown/?st=ITJNZGK5&amp;sh=ee08d972   Another user posted a photo of his, same combo. Literally the only other camera in my house (apart from my 6+ that is factory reset so I can sell it) is an original iPad mini, and I can't get any good shots.	Shybrenn	t1_d82c35p
t3_548ls6	t1_d82jejt	1474892957	Yep I agree. 90% of the reason I got the 7 plus is for the camer and shooting video -and I can't shoot video, I can hear the hiss and a high pitched buzzing noise too. And not just on videos in a quiet room!	soundawake	t1_d7zspht
t3_54ctsj	t1_d82lhw8	1474896876	I wonder if it would look better when the leather is worn and dirtier after some use?	bravado	t1_d827yov
t3_54ctsj	t1_d82ns1n	1474900307	I saw another post talking about how it patinas VERY nicely. Haha considering going back to the brown after seeing that post. I'm so indecisive.	RidiQlous	t1_d82lhw8
t3_548ls6	t1_d82q1i3	1474903353	Yes. Buzzing is not a huge deal. Buzzing audibly so that 4k videos sound worse than a 10 year old flip video, not acceptable. These threads all get buried in this sub but noise affecting the video recordings IS A DEFECT. I don't care what some computer nerd posts about how it's normal and not a problem. If my 7+ hisses in video playback it's going back.	cru_jonze	t1_d7zt6nc

t3_54l8z0	t1_d82rnm8	1474905417	I'm pretty sure they will just replace the phone entirely. You should contact Apple Support or if you have the chance go to your nearest Apple store to see if they have any replacements in stock.  They usually have a handful of iPhone's in stock for defects	t00w00t	t3_54l8z0
t3_54l8z0	t1_d82s5dz	1474906038	Don't guess if you don't use the answer. OP, google search something called dead pixel anomaly threshold. Officially, Apple will replace your device if your device hits a predetermined, acceptable number of dead pixels. This number is higher for different devices, and generally grows in size proportional to the number of pixels the display has. E.g. an iPod nano might be 2 dead pixels = acceptable, where a 27" iMac has an acceptable dead pixel count = 8. Apple will replace your device if it falls under this threshold, but if the new device also falls under the threshold, they will not replace that one.  Edit: [here's](http://osxdaily.com/2010/11/04/apple-dead-pixel-stuck-pixel-policy/) the proof but you saps just bandwagon on what the current votes are instead of listening to facts so proof would fall on deaf ears.	FoxMcWeezer	t1_d82rnm8
t3_54l8z0	t1_d82s8l4	1474906153	I had one on my 6 after a year of use and they replaced the phone. You should be fine.  EDIT: To be clear I only had 1 single dead pixel and they still replaced it.	neophunk	t3_54l8z0
t3_54l8z0	t1_d82sbvc	1474906269	They have a zero dead pixel policy for the iphone.	neophunk	t1_d82s5dz
t3_54l8z0	t1_d82td8f	1474907565	I recently had this happen twice on iPhone 6s Plus. Top left of the screen was one dead pixel and quickly turned into multiple dead pixels.  I took my phone to an Apple Store, the first time they just replaced the screen. The second time I requested they replaced the entire handset, which they did.	jlwood92	t3_54l8z0
t3_54l8z0	t1_d82tmg2	1474907885	I don't understand why this is getting down voted. OP just spent nearly a grand for something that doesn't work properly, and is concerned with their purchase.  Anyway, I think you should be OK. Apple's customer service has always treated me well.  I had some LCD issues with my Macbook Pro that I bought used from eBay.  The MBP was still under manufacturer warranty and they replaced it out without question after running their tests. Didn't cost me a dime!  Edit: a word.	americanmuscle1988	t3_54l8z0
t3_54l8z0	t1_d82x83w	1474912408	He mentioned it's red against a black background so pretty obvious.  I, too, have a zero bad pixel and no dust under screen tolerance and will exchange or return.	mi7chy	t1_d82wke1
t3_54l8z0	t1_d82y0ld	1474913411	Who said its not working properly? 1 dead pixel is outside the acceptable levels for a replacement.  I believe it needs to be 4 or more.	TurboPGT	t1_d82tmg2
t3_54l8z0	t1_d82y63n	1474913606	You can easily get it swapped out.  My 7 Plus had a defect in the top right corner when I bought it last Friday. The rubber ring between the screen and the body was indented by a few millimeters. Not a big deal, but cosmetically you could notice it right away. Not to mention who knows how it affected water resistance. I took it back to the Apple Store (fwiw a different Apple Store) the next day and they swapped it out for me.   Apple is generally good about swapping out defective phones the first few weeks after launch. I guarantee you get a new one no questions asked. Ignore the phone stock on their site; they always have extras in the back, and if they don't, they'll arrange something for you.	jumbledbumblecrumble	t3_54l8z0
t3_54l8z0	t1_d82yix5	1474914057	i had my 6 plus replaced because of a single dead pixel. OP: take it in when you can (ASAP) and get it replaced, while it is in tolerance, its still something they'll replace for.	c0deater	t1_d82y0ld
t3_54l8z0	t1_d830eq4	1474916425	I don't care if it falls under the the acceptable range of 4 or less pixels.  When you buy a brand new product for nearly a grand, you better get a product which works 100% perfectly out of the box.  It's ridiculous how I have to explain this.  OP, for the money you've spent, and the amount of time you've had your phone, you should get your phone replaced.	americanmuscle1988	t1_d82y0ld
t3_54l8z0	t1_d830zzm	1474917171	Yeah you're dead wrong about that. Pretty ironic too since you told t00w00t not to say anything if he didn't know the answer. Apple will replace the iPhone if it has even a single dead pixel on it.	emgirgis95	t1_d82s5dz
t3_54ctsj	t1_d831gyd	1474917763	I have big hands, and the plus has the telephoto lens camera. To me bigger is better. I have no problem with typing with one hand. 5.5" screen is perfect for photos, videos, etc... I can understand why those with normal sized hands may like the iphone 7.	throwaway7861620098	t1_d8284a6
t3_54l8z0	t1_d831yh4	1474918364	Apple has a 14 day return policy. Demand they replace it with a new device instead of attempting to repair it. They will, because you can just return it for full refund and buy a new phone with the money anyway.  edit: I would definitely return it before your 14 day window is up -- after that they will either attempt to do a screen replacement under warranty or swap it for a refurb.	nephyxx	t3_54l8z0
t3_54l8z0	t1_d8325t3	1474918618	They will give you a new white box replacement no charge at all. You'd be in and out within like 15 minutes with a new 7 Plus	DaShata	t3_54l8z0

t3_54l8z0	t1_d832c0e	1474918830	Apple has specific DOA parts in store. That is they have phones of most models to swap out immediately and take care of it because any repair done means the phone CANNOT be returned. Because you have just purchased it they should swap it no questions asked	mikeofhyrule	t3_54l8z0
t3_54l8z0	t1_d833hz7	1474920264	Apple has REALLY high standards. Especially around this kind of launch. Wouldn't doubt a replacement or at very least a repair.	benclayton	t1_d82y0ld
t3_54l8z0	t1_d833nte	1474920464	Because this subreddit is full of Apple dick throaters. These people are the reason apple can decrease the quality of the iPhone every year to increase profits. Yellow screens, dead pixels, hissing, scratches straight out of the box. All will be more commonplace than they already are.	lunaprospect	t1_d82tmg2
t3_54l8z0	t1_d835ob7	1474923004	Still with this? Stop crying on Reddit acting like Tim Cook ran over your puppy and get on the phone to apple.  No, apple aren't letting quality slip to cut costs, because for every one of the complaints you're rehashing people are posting that they have visited an Apple Store and got a new unit, or replacement screen. That costs money for Apple, over and above what they'd save cutting costs.  They are selling close to 100,000,000 iPhone 7's in the next 3-6 months and occasionally a few will have issues - that's called fucking reality. These are highly complex devices made up of lots of different parts sourced from many manufacturers - every now and then a duff unit will get out there. Same goes for car manufacturers, computer makers, pretty much any complex machine that is built for sale can have an issue - the real mark of a company is how they deal with it. In apples case they are awesome and will swap it out for you to make sure you're a happy camper.	_DuranDuran_	t1_d833nte
t3_54l8z0	t1_d836cmj	1474923879	i had a dead pixel on my iPhone 6 and took it right back to the Apple store, they replaced it with no hassle with a brand new one, not a refurb, but that was same day of purchase probably within 4 hours of purchase.	Samueul	t3_54l8z0
t3_54l8z0	t1_d837zqm	1474926095	Jesus Christ, did you even *read* the article you linked? It clearly says the iPhone or iPod gets replaced with 1 dead pixel. You just proved that guy's comment.	emgirgis95	t1_d82si23
t3_54l8z0	t1_d838bkf	1474926546	Just reserve a new one when you can and return it. You've got 14 days, no questions asked. I'm sure they'd also replace the screen for you outside of the return window, but it may take longer.	subhuman1979	t3_54l8z0
t3_54l8z0	t1_d8399r4	1474927894	Apple will prob. replace the screen. Dead pixels happen. I had one on a 5S and one on a 6, genius replaced both quickly.	Rocko9999	t3_54l8z0
t3_54l8z0	t1_d83d31s	1474933417	Good idea. The only thing I'm questionable about is I paid using AT&amp;T Next. AT&amp;T promo was buy a 7 by 9/25 and trade in your 6 for guaranteed $650 in credits.

t3_54l8z0	t1_d83m8ie	1474944762	Right now your replacement would be brand new, not a refurb. They won't replace the screen this early in the product life.

t3_54l8z0	t1_d84b00q	1474995288	Nowhere in your comment did you say that 1 dead pixel is replaceable. You said an iPod nano *might* be 2 dead pixels is within the replacement threshold. Then the article you referenced said 1 pixel is within the replacement threshold for iPod nanos. You told the previous commenter not to guess if you didn't know the answer, yet you guessed on the replacement thresholds. I guess I have a problem with someone calling someone out for trying to help for offering an opinion, then doing the exact thing they called that person out on. The comment suggested OP call customer support, which is a direct way to find out if the phone is replaceable, and they might even replace it if OP is reasonable and respectable toward customer service regardless of the threshold. You gave a link to an unofficial article. It would suffice to say you have no idea what the official threshold is.   TL;DR: don't call someone out for guessing about something (when they didn't even guess), then turn around and make a guess yourself. You are a hypocrite.	Deep_Quote_Banana	t1_d847ogi

t3_54s0h1	t1_d84gzy5	1475002858	Will do, I'll keep you updated for sure. Apple is usually very good with exchanging and you can exchange for any reason, open or closed for two weeks. Hoping this tightens otherwise I am going to swap it.	TOO_FUTURE	t1_d84ga0m
t3_54s0h1	t1_d84hdyh	1475003354	I've had the same thing happen on the left hand side of the leather case for my + too. At first I tried to exchange the case for another but it ended up being the same more or less. I think it has to do with the way they make the cases, they have to design it with some give so that you can slide the phone into and out of the case.  I could be wrong but I think it's normal for a leather case. If it's really bugging you take it to Apple Retail and swap it out, I don't see them making a stink.	hhajahmad	t3_54s0h1
t3_54s0h1	t1_d84hgwh	1475003458	Thanks for the reassurance man. Makes sense that they would make it that way. Going to see what others say and check out and Apple Store to see if they all do it	TOO_FUTURE	t1_d84hdyh

t3_54s0h1	t1_d84k1e4	1475006713	My two cents: I have a Storm Grey leather case on my 7 Plus. I remove it almost daily as I use another case at night, and mine has "some give" in the lower left, but just enough to take it off. Otherwise, no squeal or slack in the case.	Don_Drapper	t3_54s0h1
t3_54s0h1	t1_d84ksr9	1475007665	Thanks for the input! Yeah mine on the bottom right, above the corner, you can like push in and here it squeak against the inside.

t3_54s0h1	t1_d84l52s	1475008095	Probably two different from yours,  but maybe the same. My new saddlebrown case didn't fit right until I squeezed on the two bottom corners. Mine has a tight fit, it felt too small. So make sure after putting it on flip it around and pull those bottom corners over the side of the phone. Should give a nice leathery sound. Hope this helps	goldenfelix	t3_54s0h1
t3_54s0h1	t1_d84lwrr	1475009046	I actually think I found the issue. On the inside right side there is a small leather bump in the case, most likely causing it to be uneven when sitting in the case. Will try another and see if it occurs	TOO_FUTURE	t3_54s0h1

t3_54s0h1	t1_d85tx4u	1475087128	I cannot give you an answer for that right now, but probably all it will do is get darker as time goes. I just returned it and exchanged it for a saddle brown (I wanted something that contrasts with the color of my phone). I am wondering if the Apple logo will "disappear" with time as it did on previous versions of the leather case, as it appears to be made from a different piece of leather.  EDIT: If you are between the Storm Grey and Midnight Blue, I'd strongly encourage you to go with Storm Grey on the long run: the change in color will look more uniform on the Grey, as on the blue it will be quite apparent and depending on how you hold your phone, might looks more dirty than "old".

The rent a movie trick no longer works to free up storage however you can do it with a large app store app now. (Disney infinity toy box)   &gt;2.)Screen protectors, Past iphone screen protectors might not work well with the iphone 7 because of the wider speaker grill, This all depends on the design some will work. Also most glass screen protectors are the same thing tempered glass I personally see no need to pay $50 for them, amazon has many two packs for around $10   &gt;3.) The dongle not in the box? its underneath the headphones. Also the dongle does have a DAC. For those that want to charge and listen to music with lightning headphones click here Make wired headphones wireless   &gt;4.) Cases, plenty of cheap cases on amazon for under $20 spigen has some good ones, bumper case for those that want to show off your phone $24.99 7 7+ Apples battery case is only for the 7 not 7 Plus.   &gt;5.) Portait mode is a iOS 10.1 feature in beta right now. sign up   &gt;6.)Check iPhone stock here Check planes full of iphones arriving in us here   &gt;7.)The Speakers are located on the bottom right and one in the earpiece speaker not on the bottom left, the barometric vent is there to help gps.   &gt;8.) Modems, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile have intel modems in them that do not support CDMA (wont work on sprint and verizon) Sprint and Verizon models have qualcomm modems which do support CDMA and GSM, will work on all carriers, Also there is no sim free version yet (9/28/16) in the US.   &gt;9.) for people with jet black iphones here are some clear skins to protect phone from scratches. 7 7+   &gt;10.)

t3_54zmfe	t1_d86j0t4	1475123489	Slightly off topic, but I wonder what you guys think. I always use a screen protector, but not to actually protect my screen, as I feel that it doesn't need protecting anymore.

Anyways, what is bugging me is why is no one investigating this in terms of if this hiss is a defect.  Can someone run benchmarks, one with hissing iphone, one with out and just confirm it,  If anything... I don't know if this is a placebo effect, but my game never slows down, and there are times when it even performs really fast, when I hear the hissing noise,   so does that hiss matter? is it better or is it worse, can someone prove it with benchmarks.  I know its such a small deal but it would help	sillyfinny180	t3_54zmfe

t3_555gjh	t1_d87ufa1	1475204888	Currently on my black iPhone 7 Plus, I am using a Speck case. It's a "Presidio grip" case. It works well on keeping the phone in my hand, which is a big deal for me! I was using the phone naked for about maybe 5 days and the phone was very slippery. So I went out and bought the case. It is very minimal and very well aesthetically designed. On the box it mentioned they can be dropped at 10 feet. Hopefully I won't have to experience that though! But, I do enjoy a minimal case with great protection with a added bonus to the rubber grippy sides.

t3_55o15o	t1_d8c65ba	1475506978	Cheapest way is to buy the phone full price up front.	rudedood	t3_55o15o
t3_55o15o	t1_d8c748k	1475508307	Before this, with an upgraded phone plan (something I will need regardless) I have never paid more than $200 for a phone. I don't see how buying this one outright for $770 could be the cheapest way.	romanticheart	t1_d8c65ba
t3_55o15o	t1_d8c7qn1	1475509136	Before this, you bought your phones on a two-year contract which subsidized the price of the phone by making you pay essentially a "down" payment and then overcharging you for two whole years to make it up. Now, the ability to sign one of those contracts is gone. With it goes the subsidized phone pricing. However, you can buy your phone outright and look to a cheaper MVNO to get similar service for a lower price over two years.	aldrinjtauro	t1_d8c748k
t3_55o15o	t1_d8c7w12	1475509336	I'm not sure how the previous poster came to this conclusion but I would suggest looking at porting the number over to VZW. Everyone is looking to get new customers and they usually offer steep discounts/rebates for switching. Most all carriers now are using the device payment plans with zero percent interest. Buying the phone outright is same cost as buying it on a payment plan, you're just spreading the cost out over 2 years.	KevOK80	t1_d8c748k
t3_55o15o	t1_d8c84h5	1475509646	Also you should have had a line fee added to that upgrade. If not that was your last upgraded phone. If you have a line fee, your bill will be similarly priced with the NEXT program. If you didn't well AT&amp;T did you a huge solid, and wont reciprocate it again.	mikeofhyrule	t1_d8c748k
t3_55o15o	t1_d8c8t64	1475510544	&gt; overcharging you for two whole years to make it up  This is what I originally thought would be the case, but the bill never changed. It's also not listed anywhere on the pricing breakdown, but I guess that doesn't mean what you're saying isn't true. Either way, I'm now pretty sad that AT&amp;T did away with this and now forces you to either buy it outright or do the payment plans, which require a credit check I'd most likely fail. Bummer. Thank you for your reply!	romanticheart	t1_d8c7qn1
t3_55o15o	t1_d8c8v0v	1475510612	&gt; device payment plans with zero percent interest  I know through Apple and with AT&amp;T Next this requires a credit check, which I am pretty sure I'd fail unless they read the report (rather than just the score). Would it be the same thing for Verizon?	romanticheart	t1_d8c7w12
t3_55o15o	t1_d8c9rmg	1475511800	Downvote me to hell, but if you can't afford full price, and your credit score is below what would be required to take one of the financing options, you maybe should question whether or not you absolutely NEED the new iPhone.	2xtreme21	t1_d8c8v0v
t3_55o15o	t1_d8ca33k	1475512208	I expected at least one response like this and while I appreciate your concern, this isn't what I came here inquiring about. I am going to be needing my own plan soon anyway, so I came here to see if there was any options for reduced prices on the phone for new plans or any other similar promotions. If I have to change providers/plans anyway, I might as well see if I can get a cheap upgrade while I'm at it.	romanticheart	t1_d8c9rmg
t3_55o15o	t1_d8cbs7u	1475514330	Why do you think you would fail a credit check? A mobile credit check doesn't use the same criteria as a mortgage you realise? You've already stated you have a perfect payment history; fuck the utilisation bullshit. The main thing is regular oayments and you've done just fine with that.   I don't see why you wouldn't pass a mobile credit check.	ahx-fos	t1_d8c8t64
t3_55o15o	t1_d8cbvds	1475514438	My score is very low due to the utilization. Will a mobile credit check be based off of payment history only? If so then I should be fine. I just assumed my low score would instantly disqualify me. I've never done a mobile credit check before!	romanticheart	t1_d8cbs7u
t3_55o15o	t1_d8cbxdl	1475514507	The equipment installment plans are actually a cheaper pricing model than 2year contracts	Bbypndabamboo	t1_d8c8t64
t3_55o15o	t1_d8cbznv	1475514583	Yes it's subject to a credit report but I wouldn't count yourself out. If your SO has good credit you could move your phone to her account and she would be the responsible party who gets the credit check and not you.	KevOK80	t1_d8c8v0v
t3_55o15o	t1_d8cc5f5	1475514781	Unfortunately, he's currently in the same boat as I am - perfect payment history, high utilization, low score. I assume they would have to do a new credit check on the account rather than go off of what they already had from when he originally signed up (and had a decent score)?	romanticheart	t1_d8cbznv
t3_55o15o	t1_d8cchru	1475515208	I think you misunderstand what a credit 'score' is. A credit score is meaningless. A lender has algorithms that look at your report then make their own lending judgement based on that. The 'score' the CRAs provide is meaningless in real world application.   Re utilisation; I doubt a mobile provider cares. Your report shows a regular history of payments to all creditors, right? If so, I very much doubt you'll have any problems.	ahx-fos	t1_d8cbvds
t3_55o15o	t1_d8cckiy	1475515304	This, Verizon is doing a trade in promotion where you get 550 for your iPhone 6.   http://imgur.com/MaDlYVJ  The whole phone cost becomes $99 instead of $649. No subsidies or weird discounting. Check with your local Verizon corporate store. My advice is not to visit an authorized retailer (diamond wireless, etc).	Bbypndabamboo	t1_d8c7w12
t3_55o15o	t1_d8ccpmy	1475515480	If you have an iPhone 6, they currently have a promotion where you can trade in your 6 for a free iPhone 7. If you decide you want a 7+, you'll just need to pay the difference over the two year next plan.	kingajeezy	t3_55o15o
t3_55o15o	t1_d8cd27w	1475515910	Yes you're probably right. IMO the only way to know for sure is to try. But if you can't get a phone on a credit check you're not going to be able to get service either so it sounds like no phone for you. If your SO can add a line to his account without a credit check your best bet might be to buy the phone outright from Apple as "unlocked" and activate it on his account. Good luck.	KevOK80	t1_d8cc5f5
t3_55o15o	t1_d8cdb8y	1475516214	The person I was talking about said that buying it outright is cheaper. What you posted is a deal for device payments, not an outright upfront purchase. It literally says that in the screen shot you posted. You have to make your payments for the full 24 months to get the full amount of the rebate.	KevOK80	t1_d8cckiy
t3_55o15o	t1_d8cdu80	1475516852	Maybe the bill never changed because you've always been on contracts and getting new phones? If that's true, you've been doing what the OP said from the start.	sugarkryptonite	t1_d8c8t64

t3_55o15o	t1_d8cibhm	1475522419	I ended up doing this.  It wasn't exactly how they made it sound. I turned in my 6 64gb for my 7+ 128gb. My bill went up 6 dollars a month. You are forced to keep paying the 6 dollars a month instead of paying remainder off. If you pay it all off you lose your credits they give you each month for the "free iPhone7"	Mrwokn	t1_d8ccpmy

t3_55o15o	t1_d8cm6p1	1475527217	What actually IS your credit score at? Do you know?   I ask because I know several people with iPhones on monthly payment plans that I know for a fact truly have shitty credit. As in, car repo'd, credit cards in collections, etc. Not judging their financial decisions.. but carriers tend to give out phones to nearly anyone.  Your best bet would be to go into a branch for your carrier and say you want to upgrade, and have them run whatever they run for your new phone.   For me on AT&amp;T's Next program they didn't even bother with a credit check (read: no hard pulls on my credit report) since I've been a customer for some time in good standing. Give it a shot. Worst they'll say is "nope sorry" and then you tell them you'll be taking your business elsewhere.   Mobile service is cut-throat. They'll either tell you "wait a min" and give you a plan where you pre-pay a deposit that'll be credited toward your phone's payoff schedule or figure out a way for a manager to override it.   If that fails, there'll certainly be another carrier that'll be willing to sell you an iPhone 7 at a payment plan.	6119442a08276dbb22e9	t1_d8cjd9c

t3_55o15o	t1_d8cmtm3	1475528016	Yes, but the device payments are literally the full retail purchase over 24 months. No interest and no additional fees compared to full retail.

t3_55o15o	t1_d8css1d	1475536257	Last I checked it was in the very low 600's. I don't have any negatives on my credit at all, and nearly 7 years of 100% on-time payments. The only thing negatively impacting my score is utilization. Being laid off for two months and needing emergency dental surgery caused 2015 to not be my finest year financially. Maxed out credit cards are a bitch to come back from.   Thank you so much for your advice! I think I'm going to go into both AT&amp;T and Verizon and basically see which one is willing to give me the best deal. Thanks again!	romanticheart	t1_d8cm6p1
t3_55o15o	t1_d8cufpx	1475538767	Gosh, that sucks.  I'm on a family plan with AT&amp;T and have the unlimited data.  I would hate to lose it.	pongmanJ25	t3_55o15o
t3_55o15o	t1_d8cxff0	1475543209	Correct. But if you can't get approved for a Verizon plan you're not getting a Verizon iPhone 7.	KevOK80	t1_d8csn67
t3_55o15o	t1_d8cxoyh	1475543577	Of course the promotion is a better deal than buying it outright. But you must have missed the 10x OP said they probably can't get approved for the loan because of their credit. No approval, no promotion.	KevOK80	t1_d8cmtm3
t3_55o15o	t1_d8d3jt2	1475552082	As far as I know, the AT&amp;T promotion giving the $650 credit has already ended, as well as VZW. The only carrier still offering a similar promotion is Sprint.	jessicaho656	t1_d8css1d
t3_55o15o	t1_d8d3lgw	1475552156	ATT and T-Mobile ended on 25th, not sure when VZW ended exactly but it ended, and Sprint is the only carrier offering the promotion at this time.	jessicaho656	t1_d8ce7v8

t3_55tcxo	t3_55tcxo	1475586149	Anyone not able to fully enjoy their iPhone due to "battery saving" tips?	EndoveProduct	-1
t3_55tcxo	t1_d8dh32e	1475587083	My iPhone 6 wasn't lasting a full day. I never bothered with any battery saving stuff (apart from Low Power Mode at 20%, which naturally sort of spoiled the experience). I don't tend to keep my battery percentage indicator on, either - I'd rather just use my phone, without the anxiety of having to squeeze every last drop out of it!  My iPhone 7 has been a huge improvement for any number of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that my phone genuinely lasts all day now, the way I typically use it!	Ixius	t3_55tcxo
t3_55tcxo	t1_d8dh6ou	1475587253	I've never bothered with any of those battery saving tips, I'd rather just have a charger with me or if away from power outlets I'll have an external battery with me.	aussie_jason	t3_55tcxo
t3_55tcxo	t1_d8dlkdi	1475593585	Honestly, I couldn't care less about the animations, and I don't want email fetching anyway.	kickstand	t3_55tcxo
t3_55tcxo	t1_d8dmvw5	1475595300	I turned on that one feature to let me use the magic message sending crap (invisible ink and whatnot).  I'm not a fan of the exaggerated animations that result using the rest of the phone.	makoblade	t3_55tcxo
t3_55tcxo	t1_d8dmxwa	1475595371	Most of those tips are obsolete when you can just use low power mode, which is more effective since they can adjust things they don't provide user settings for.   I never understood the "turn off auto brightness" tip either. Just use auto brightness and adjust it to whatever is comfortable for you.	nephyxx	t3_55tcxo
t3_55tcxo	t1_d8dv8s8	1475605594	It uses more battery since it's actively looking for a change in lightning.	Pippkorn	t1_d8dmxwa
t3_55tcxo	t1_d8dxa2c	1475608090	My 7, when I first got it, used to last half the day. After a week or two it does great now. Maybe just give it some time to figure everything out.	goldenfelix	t3_55tcxo
t3_55tcxo	t1_d8dxh9d	1475608337	You didn't read my original post did you...lol	EndoveProduct	t1_d8dxa2c
t3_55tcxo	t1_d8e0haq	1475612018	On my old Galaxy S4 I had to do everything possible to save battery, and STILL had to plug in half way through the day. Now I don't give a fuck. I don't even carry any cables around at all and don't turn anything off. This battery is leaps and bounds better.	Buttstache	t3_55tcxo
t3_55tcxo	t1_d8e17u5	1475612912	I remember jumping through so many hoops on Android to squeeze out every precious second of battery life on the thing. Disabling wake locks, installing kernels, Rooting. All that good stuff.   It's very refreshing to just not worry about tweaking every little setting on the iPhone. I just use it how I would normally use it and don't need to worry about rouge apps or background services that I don't want running. It just lasts most of the day and that's all I need.	odnalyd	t1_d8e0haq
t3_55tcxo	t1_d8e1j45	1475613286	Oh man, I can't count how many wake locks I hunted down on that phone, or how many stupid obscure settings I tried changing.	Buttstache	t1_d8e17u5
t3_55tcxo	t1_d8e8y0s	1475623253	For my last iPhone or two, I immediately enabled "Reduce motion".  Not anymore.  Time to enjoy those super-sleek and smooth transitions. :)	trippalhealicks	t3_55tcxo
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8ebhu4	1475626973	I did that last year with the 6s Plus and 6s. It was fine, but I ultimately missed the battery life enough that I'm back on a 7 Plus this year. The camera is nice to have, but I think they made enough improvements with the regular size model to make it worthwhile as well. So in the end, it just comes down to whether or not you're willing to sacrifice that gigantic battery.	greatcaffeine	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8ebn8e	1475627190	You do whatever makes you happier. There will be people who will commend or criticize you. It is your job to do what makes you happier and to not give a shit.  With that being said, weigh out your values and the technical specs. These are two different models with pluses (no pun intended) and minuses. Does the smaller frame outweigh the technical differences in your value system?  I am a vehement 6S owner and did not go to the 6S+. This year I will be moving onto the 7+.	bumpkinspicefatte	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8ebo98	1475627233	I snagged one of these cases from Best Buy and I love it. It's grippy, military drop protection, and it adds almost zero bulk. May be worth looking into.   http://www.bestbuy.com/site/platinum-d30-protective-case-for-apple-iphone-7-plus-black/5559800.p?skuId=5559800	wund3rground	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8ecsie	1475628790	Thanks - appreciate the suggestion. I'm currently using a Spigen case - it's not as bulky as some, which is nice for sure.	misterkevo	t1_d8ebo98
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8ecsx3	1475628806	I went from a 6S Plus to a 6S, and then ultimately back to a 6S Plus and now to the 7 Plus. While I like the smaller form factor, I've gotten used to the bigger screen and I think the resolution is far superior. The 7's screen is really, really nice, but can't compare to the 1080p resolution.   It all depends on what you use the phone for. If you're really into taking photos with the 7 Plus, you'll miss having the 56mm equivalent lens. I think the battery life is significantly better than the 7, as well.	saullyj	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8ecvc0	1475628904	The only spec differences between the 7 and 7+  are the screen size, dual camera and battery correct? Otherwise I believe the internals are identical.	misterkevo	t1_d8ebn8e
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8ed6ko	1475629340	I have this case and I love it! Protection all around, minimal drop protection, but very slim!  http://www.spigen.com/collections/iphone-7-plus/products/iphone-7-plus-case-liquid-armor	c0rtexiphan	t1_d8ecsie
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8edzym	1475630382	Nope, there are still several other differences, both hardware (2gb of RAM on the 7 and 3gb of RAM on the 7+) and software (portrait mode exclusive to 7+).	bumpkinspicefatte	t1_d8ecvc0
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8eevfi	1475631483	I had a rhinoshield bumper case on my 6+. The phone was in pretty much perfect condition when I traded it in for the 7 (I have one on my 7 now).    It adds a good bit of durability and keeps the phone pretty slim. It obviously won't protect the back from keys or coins in your pocket, but I make an effort to keep my phone alone in my pocket.	mcarrode	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8efcs2	1475632067	I returned a plus and went all the way down to an SE. It's actually faster than the plus in opening a lot of apps for some reason, perhaps the lower resolution. I don't have issues with the smaller keyboard and don't need 3d touch or the better camera.  Also, not missing haptic engine or faster fingerprint sensor. And those are about the only things the plus offer.  So now I've got a lighter, more comfortable to carry iphone that is faster and has unreal battery life. ipad mini 2 was still a lot better to use for general browsing than the plus anyway.	epik	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8egchk	1475633263	After going from the Note line down to the s7 and iphone 6s line, I will never look back.  The larger phones are great, but they're just too damn big for everyday use. I don't miss the larger screen, even small text isnt an issue on a 4.7" screen. I read kindle on my phone everyday and it's not even a slight issue.  4.7" is the perfect size for me.  I'm a 6' 200lb guy with medium/large hands.	jkslate	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8egijg	1475633463	I tried to make the switch to the 7 from the 6+ but I returned it after one day, the screen resolution is lower on the 7 vs the + and it makes text look fuzzy in comparison.	i_hug_peas	t1_d8ecvc0
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8ej939	1475636733	I couldn't do it after getting so adjusted to the larger display size	elguap	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8ejcx0	1475636876	If comfort is a factor, you could consider getting one of the Love Handle straps that adheres to the back of your case. It makes the phone much more manageable IMO, and they're relatively cheap on amazon. c:	caseydoeswords	t3_55wqnt

t3_55wqnt	t1_d8elyu6	1475640717	I've been contemplating exchanging my 7+ for the 7 since I got it a little over a week ago. It's mainly due to the size in my pocket &amp; in my hands. My hands are large enough to use it but I feel like I'm going to drop it multiple times a day. I just can't decide if I want to part with the absolutely amazing battery.   I do take and edit a ton of photos and videos with my phone, but not exactly sure how much I will use the 56mm lens (used it once to test it out), portrait mode is fun to play with but again, not sure how much I'll actually use it, so I feel pretty confident the regular 7's camera would work for me.   I love the fact that this plus battery lasts me all day with what I would consider more than average use (laying in bed now with 51% left, and took off the charger a little over 16 hours ago).   I was a block away from the Apple Store tonight so I stopped in to check the regular 7 out again, and it is the perfect size for me but the 2 Apple employees I spoke to (who both own a plus) quickly tried to talk me out of exchanging because of 4 main reasons: screen resolution, battery size, dual cameras and 1 extra gb of ram. So I played with a 7 and honestly didn't see a difference in the screen, nor did I see a difference in the speed. I was told by the one employee that his wife has had the 7 since launch and is very disappointed with the battery coming from a 6+, and that scares me. Yeah, they have a battery case that I would have to invest in for days out of town and traveling but that just adds more bulk/weight.   So I have a tough decision to make over the next 2 days (Thursday is the last day I'll be able to exchange since I'll be out of town all weekend and was told technically only have 13 days for the exchange since the day I got it counts as day 1).  It's not the end of the world with whatever decision I make, I would just love to have a phone that fits in my pocket without discomfort and I can use with 1 hand without fear of dropping it but want a battery that lasts me all day without worry about having to recharge.	PamZero	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8enizr	1475643616	I couldn't imagine using a phone that large day to day.	ryangehret	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8eo168	1475644676	I had an employer-supplied 5S for a little while. Thing was so light and compact that I had to pat my pocket to double-check that it was on me. And that was after I put a case on it.  I can't do without the fingerprint sensor on these new phones, though.	Captain_Midnight	t1_d8efcs2
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8eoooo	1475646135	You will regret it. I had the same concerns as you and once I changed it, I regretted it. Buy a smaller case, if you are a butter fingers well just try to be more careful. I only use a case when I go out and drink. Stay with the plus.	Mrpornogoregrinder	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8epikl	1475648198	As much I like the big ass screen, the better battery life, I just couldn't really use it. My hands are small as fuck😩. The 6 barley fits one hand. I have to use two.  I got a 7 this go around.	breannaward85	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8epnlv	1475648574	I switched from a 6 to a 7+. I picked up my 6 the other day and couldn't even slightly imagine going back to the smaller screen. Try to use a smaller phone for a few minutes before you make your choice	Akwardadam	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8eqo6z	1475651497	These are the exact reasons I'm on 7. It's the ease of use I valued more than big battery. Battery is very subjective. The bigger and better, the more you start using your phone and end result is just same. I am not clumsy but at times do drop my phone. So a case or naked.  Either way makes 7+ humongous.	eighteencircle9	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8eqp6y	1475651584	I came to 7 from a 950 XL. I feel the other way after using 7. I think 7+ is huge just like OP. Every time I pick up a big screen phone first thing I notice is weight and poor handling.	eighteencircle9	t1_d8epnlv
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8eqrqi	1475651806	Those 4 reasons aren't really 4. You have bigger battery because at that resolution and that size you NEED big battery. That extra RAM is essential because you have fancy camera for well lit environment. All in all it has a camera that only works well on well lit environment and big screen. Everything else isn't there to benefit you, it's to support other two hardware enhancements.	eighteencircle9	t1_d8elyu6
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8eqtzt	1475652000	I suppose I adjusted to the larger screen quickly. However if OP has been using the + it would still be wise to play around with the smaller screen first.	Akwardadam	t1_d8eqp6y
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8eqyxm	1475652438	I mean 50g heavier has to count for something? I know when folks shot down phones for crossing the 150g magic threshold in the past.	eighteencircle9	t1_d8eqtzt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8erqlw	1475655034	Time ago I switched from 6+ to 6, and now I have bought a 7 because of the size. It's more confortable, and it's my best choice.  IMHO, the Plus versions are for 2 meters men with 100kg with giant pockets, because I couldn't put an iPhone Plus in my jeans; impossible.  Sorry for my english, i'm not native.  Edit: It isn't a downgrade, it's an upgrade if you feel better with an iPhone 7 than with an iPhone 7 Plus.	Retosteante	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8euyxr	1475666327	I went from a 6s Plus to a regular 7. It's just so much easier. The Plus was so beautiful but not practical for me.	ZKXX	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8ew0mj	1475668994	Right but all that is a benefit to me, so they are on my pro/con list for making a decision to switch or not.   So the plus is better at low light shots over the regular 7? I thought the main cameras were identical, and the only difference was the optical (2x) zoom lens and ability to do portraits?	PamZero	t1_d8eqrqi
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8ex03q	1475671131	Plus isn't any better in low light than normal. In low light the second camera doesn't even get involved. Same with extra RAM and battery - for that big ass screen your usage isn't going to drain it but screen time will consume more battery. So it's analogous to buying a car with bigger tank so that you can have more fuel but if it's going to use more fuel than another car with smaller tank, eventually you get the same miles out of each.	eighteencircle9	t1_d8ew0mj
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8exdcw	1475671852	I may be in the minority but after using my 6+ for 2 years, I went with the regular 7. I loved the battery life of the plus but there was far too many cons for me.	fellybacca	t3_55wqnt
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8ey6mj	1475673371	From experience, what you said about the batteries isn't accurate.  While I generally don't disagree with you, I own both a 6s and 6s+.  I use both for different carriers in my country.  Without any doubt, with general use on both phones, the 6s+'s battery lasts far longer than the 6s'.  It's even come to a point where I charge the 6s every night, while I have to charge the plus during unpredictable and odd hours, between 30-40 hours from the last charge.	corpski	t1_d8ex03q
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8eyouv	1475674243	Well, I did opt for the optional 32gal gas tank in my Ram so I do not have to fill up as often especially on long road trips and I love it :)  I get that the plus has a larger screen/overall size and because of that they have room for a larger battery to power everything and the battery lasts a lot longer than the regular 7.  I've been asking family, friends and reading on reddit/forums, people with the 7 and average to heavy usage have to juice their phone up by dinner time to make it through the rest of the day, and with my Plus I can last AT LEAST a whole day (7am-midnight) with heavy usage and still have some battery left.  So comparing my Ram and its larger gas tank to an identical Ram with a regular gas tank, yes we get the same gas mileage, but I visit the gas station less often.  The 7+ has a larger battery and gets longer life than a 7, and that is the only point I am trying to stress for myself and others who are thinking about switching from 7+ to 7.  I just don't want to plan charging my phone around the activities I am going to be doing (ex: hurry up and get on a charger after work so when I go out I have enough juice) OR I guess I could just get a bulky battery case and be at ease.	PamZero	t1_d8ex03q

t3_55wqnt	t1_d8f2f2l	1475679650	If I understood correctly that's mostly for the camera. I'm not sure if it's available systemwide. It should be but I remember reading that it was there primarily because of their camera tricks.	FloppyDiskFish	t1_d8el0dl
t3_55wqnt	t1_d8f6o83	1475684989	I had the 7+ and felt the exact same way. About three days ago I went into the Apple Store to exchange it for the smaller 7 and I kinda regret it.   I only miss the better camera, battery life, and higher resolution. In the end I feel like the comfort I gained made it worthwhile. I've never been a big fan of huge phones. And to be frank, the 7 isn't that small.	IdrissElba	t3_55wqnt

t3_55wqnt	t1_d8fbk08	1475690917	I understand. It's a hard choice but you would know best since you've enjoyed both sizes. Both phones are awesome.  When the 6 came out, I got the 6 Plus, but after a week I returned it for the normal sized one, since I had come from a 5 and it just felt weird. So I've done what you have before.  But then after 5 or 6 months I regretted not staying with the +, the upgrade in screen size and battery were exactly what I needed. So when the 6s+ came out I got that, and now have the 7+, and loving it and used to the size. Just wish the Matte Black wasn't so slippery so I can use it without fear of dropping on the subway or in crowded spots. My girlfriend, who has much smaller hands, used my 6s+ until I sold it and while it took her a while to get used to it, she loved it and did not want to go back to the 6. I would've given it to her but I just got a ridiculously good offer yesterday for it.	thorpup	t3_55wqnt

t3_5620ie	t1_d8g59lt	1475735566	My 6s Plus started doing this on iOS 10.   Last week bought a 7 Plus and the same thing. Random restarts that take you to the password screen.   Yesterday the screen went totally black when I powered off the phone however it was still on because the home button was still active and I could take screenshots etc.   A hard reset fixed it and it rebooted.   I'm guessing it's a bug with iOS 10?	scottishswan	t3_5620ie
t3_5620ie	t1_d8g908d	1475748269	I managed to get my phone back by pressing every single button at the same time for 10 seconds. But yes it seems like it's a major software issue. Being stuck on a black screen while the phone is active is really bad.	ne1butu	t1_d8g59lt

t3_564umn	t1_d8gap6h	1475753635	I love my battery too. I charge it every two days as well and couldn't be happier. I'll use it just as much as I did my 5S, which would die in less than 18 hours because after 9.3.2 the battery went haywire and would drain like crazy.   So far I've experienced nothing but happiness.	mythrilguy	t3_564umn
t3_564umn	t1_d8gat9a	1475753931	Coming from Galaxy S6, and I've been nothing but in love with the battery life on my 7. Have had it off the charger for about 12 hours now and i'm at 77%. If I still had my GS6, I'd probably be 2 or 3 charges in at this point. Las iPhone I had was a 5c, and the battery was good on that. This one blows it out of the water. Very satisfied customer here.	alwayspluggedin	t3_564umn
t3_564umn	t1_d8gbcly	1475755260	theoretically, the 4.7" iPhone 7 is probably going to have a worse battery life than the 5.5" phones it's being compared to.  battery life is going to vary greatly by usage, and everyone uses their phones differently. the tests in that site were done on 3G talk/web browsing and not everyone is going to be doing that 24/7. so the infographic isn't really accurate for real-life usage.  taking a wild stab in the dark, if we compared Wi-Fi web browsing times of the 7 Plus to all these other phones, I think the numbers would look a lot different.  also, the writer sounds incredibly biased to me.	PKBeam64	t3_564umn
t3_564umn	t1_d8gbgtr	1475755527	My 5S dies out a lot faster than 18 hours.  I went to the shopping centre a while back and tried playing Pokemon GO over 3G. It was maybe an hour long shop but by the time I got back to the car I was already at 40% from a full charge (Low Power mode was on the whole time).  Hopefully when I get a 7 in November, I'll be able to use it for much longer.	PKBeam64	t1_d8gap6h
t3_564umn	t1_d8gbp7o	1475756051	The main difference I've found with my iPhone 6+ compared to the Galaxy S3 &amp; S4 I had was the standby time. Android just had too much running in the background that my battery would drop even when not using it. With my iPhone if i forget to charge it over night at least its never dead, at most its dropped a few % points.      Running them all day with screen on might lead to different results but as much as I do use my phone there's plenty of time when I'm not that time gives the iPhones the edge.	Rek07	t3_564umn
t3_564umn	t1_d8gc8j1	1475757172	In love with the battery.  Coming from an iPhone 5 that needed to be charged right after ending my working day (from 7am to 6pm) with only 3/4 hours of "real" use.  This one lasts the entire day (even more, depends of usage). I came to the conclusion that it can last for 8h of "real" usage (youtube/twitter/fb/whatsapp/msg/reddit (: )	Djinga_euw	t3_564umn
t3_564umn	t1_d8gcgb9	1475757607	Hmm, I wonder why your iPhone that's a year and a half newer than your S4 has better battery life.	Knight-Adventurer	t1_d8gbp7o
t3_564umn	t1_d8gcjj2	1475757781	I'm happy with the battery life on my 7 it's not as good as the 6+ I had before but it lasts an entire shift at work with pretty heavy usage and until I go to bed that night when I charge it overnight that's good enough	smokin_mitch	t3_564umn
t3_564umn	t1_d8gcpxj	1475758123	To be fair, Pokémon go is the official battery destroyer of its era.  Edit: on second thought, it's probably second to Samsung...	oouzy	t1_d8gbgtr
t3_564umn	t1_d8gdcrj	1475759288	Because those tests are one sided.  Nobody would make phone calls 12 hours straight, nor watch videos, nor lit the screen for that long.  Every user may text for 5 mins, reply a tweet, put the phone in the pocket, and drive. Play music for 10 mins drive distance. Etc  Real world usage is everything combined. And one of the major thing is idle/sleep. This is where the iPhone excels especially with the low power A10 processors	pw5a29	t3_564umn
t3_564umn	t1_d8gdcxe	1475759296	I only actually used it for maybe 5 minutes. The rest of the time my phone was downwards in my pocket with the screen dimming feature on.	PKBeam64	t1_d8gcpxj
t3_564umn	t1_d8gdl88	1475759698	That was a flawed "test".   iPhone 7 has a fantastic battery life. iOS is an incredibly efficient OS, no bloatware (e.g. Samsung phones).   iPhone 7 is the fastest phone by far, most secure, best screen and very likely best camera (Plus version). Camera testing I haven't yet read about...	EntreriPrime	t3_564umn
t3_564umn	t1_d8gdrfh	1475759990	Not really the point, my old iPhones dropped in battery when not in use compared to what the Galaxies did. I can't compare with newer models as I don't have or need separate phones for work anymore.	Rek07	t1_d8gcgb9
t3_564umn	t1_d8gdsiw	1475760040	It's pretty amazing... After a couple of weeks.   I have an iPhone 7 Plus, and the first few days the battery was not in any way remarkable - but after a few recharge cycles it's now stabilised to some impressive levels, whereI can expect to go from 7am to 11pm and still have about 50% charge under normal to heavy use.  One of the other things I found affected battery life was that using Disconnect Privacy Pro really helped, as one of my apps (not sure which one) tries to ping e.crashlytics.com about every 20 seconds - which if it weren't being blocked would tax the radio (and power) significantly.

t3_564umn	t1_d8geis0	1475761221	I was worried when I read about that too but I think the authors of all these articles are just coming from previous devices that had great battery lives to compare to. I've had a nexus 5, sony z3, and a nexus 5x, and I just got my iPhone 7 and am blown away by the battery. Idling is crazy good, I lost like 3% last night when I was asleep. even my nexus 5x with doze would lose 10% or so.	suomyn0na	t3_564umn

t3_564umn	t1_d8gex0s	1475761836	Mine was fine yesterday up until about 10pm. I received it around 1pm, it is a 7 plus 128gb jet black. It overheated last night when charging and the battery is draining rapidly. I had it charge all night in front of a fan, turned the fan off this morning when it was at 100% and left it connected. Within minutes it was hot again. Unplugged it, fan on, cool down. Fan off, 97% within 5 minutes and warm.  I shut it off. Fan, cooled down. Fan off, and it starts getting warm, while powered off. drive to work with it in front of my AC vent. Ice cold. Right side of the phone is warmer minutes after taking it away from the vent. I turn it on... 81% battery. Within 5 minutes it drops to about 77%. It's actually been plugged into my macbook for about 10 minutes now and is still sitting at 77%  So yeah, I have had a few ipads, and about 5 iphones and my track record for defective apple devices is around 30% so far.	kaithana	t3_564umn

t3_564umn	t1_d8gj7dx	1475767687	I get over 7,5 hours of screen on time out of my 7, according to the battery usage page in the settings. I have yet to come home with less than 30% and it's definitely better compared to my 6. I can't complain about the battery at all.	colacastell	t3_564umn
t3_564umn	t1_d8gjbn7	1475767830	I've been getting solid battery life on my 7 (4.7") despite the issues with Verizon network connectivity (turning off VoLTE helps though). I've never ran it down to 0%, but **at 50% it indicates usually around 4 to 4.5 hours of "Usage"**. I know that batteries aren't always linear, but projecting that out to 8-9 hours is a somewhat reasonable estimate, and definitely more than enough for my needs. I charge every night (because why not) and have no battery anxiety whatsoever about lasting the whole day. Much better than my 2 year old HTC One M8 which had good battery life in the beginning that was hurt by the Lollipop and Marshmallow updates.  In addition to the Verizon issues I have seen a few people complaining about excess power drain on iOS 10.0.2 so I am looking forward to the potential of additional power savings to come on the next update.	tka1234	t3_564umn

My parents barely use their phones.  Their iPhone 6's get them through 2 days easily.  My wife is on her phone all day.  She has to charge her iPhone 7 Plus every night and halfway through the day.

All the manufacturers, including Apple will eventually go 4k, marketing gimmick, utterly useless on tiny 5-6 inch screens.   Now, if it was say a large screen TV...even then you need a LARGE screen for 4k, 8k=titanic screen, 100inch+  As for the screens, I seen side by side comparisons, iPhone 7 Plus screen is slightly better than Note 7.

t3_56uouq	t1_d8mi961	1476138534	Charge early, charge often.  Lithium ion batteries are best kept near full, and the battery's IC will prevent overcharging. Avoid letting the battery run down to 0.	stevehobbes	t3_56uouq

t3_56uouq	t1_d8mmd7c	1476144516	Charge it whenever you need to. Batteries will deplete overtime. iPhones have an average of 500 charging cycles. A complete charging cycle happens when you have fully discharged 100% of the battery–can happen incrementally.Once you have used them up, battery capacity will decrease.

t3_56uouq	t1_d8mt9l5	1476154072	Lithium ion batteries are best kept 50%-80%. At this point it doesn't matter though. Phones regulate their charge just fine. What matters is charge cycles.	BretticusWins	t1_d8mi961
t3_56uouq	t1_d8mu1fz	1476155184	That's not true. Cycles are an approximation - not all cycles are the same; different batteries are engineered for different depth of discharge characteristics.    Charging a lithium ion battery from 0 to 100 reduces the longevity of the battery more than charging 50-100 twice (the latter will get you 20% better battery longevity).     Depth of discharge matters more than just raw cycle count.    http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries	stevehobbes	t1_d8mt9l5

t3_56uouq	t1_d8mw5r1	1476158296	No. the smart battery case powers the phone, it does not charge the iPhones internal battery. You are meant to put the case on, and use it until the case is dead, and then you still have your iPhone's internal battery to rely on.	aspoels	t1_d8mvtgt
t3_56uouq	t1_d8mwin5	1476158877	Right, so if the internal battery is used last, does that imply it goes through fewer charge cycles and end up lasting a longer time?  For example, if I had the apple battery case and never ran it down for a year, would the internal battery still be pretty close to "new", seeing as it had never been discharged?	cheesegoat	t1_d8mw5r1

t3_56uouq	t1_d8n1z9w	1476170316	There are many confusing advice online that suggest doing full cycles (depleting to 0 and charging to 100) and even "preventive steps" to fight battery stress (what you call keeping it between 40% - 80%) however, do note that in modern batteries, these steps are not required (especially for original iPhone batteries) as Apple has :  * Made the batteries automatically calibrate itself so you never have to drain to 0 and back to 100  * Made the batteries more resistant to memory effect by shutting the device down before the battery is critically low and charging the device slower (may even stop charging while plugged in) when the battery is full.   So the only real advice is, just use your phone as per normal.   There has also been theories stating, since those safeguards were in place, it would be optimal to keep your devices plugged in so you use lesser of your battery time. There's no concrete evidence for this but it makes sense especially for laptops.  Also, this may not apply to all brands of products.   Edit: Sorry bad English.	thngzys	t3_56uouq

t3_56uouq	t1_d8n4rpz	1476180333	The only thing you would gain from completely running it dead is that it would recalibrate and give you a slightly more precise %. That said, if your iPhone says 1% there is probably a little charge left to prevent damage.  But why would you do this unless you run into miscalibration issues? There is very little to be gained from it as after a year or 3 the battery's degradation will accelerate regardless of how well it was handled.	amostrespectableuser	t1_d8n1yyn
t3_56uouq	t1_d8n4wu0	1476180827	The phone "takes itself off the charger" once it nears 100%, and it restarts charging as soon as it hits something like 97%. Overnight charging is no problem at all as it just stops when it is full.  This has been the case with most Apple products for years now. I cannot think of an example where it is not true in their lineup. My 2014 ASUS brand laptop, however, does not have this feature and will overcharge its shitty ass battery.  You may be able to "save" the battery a tiny fraction with some preferential charging patterns, but it's a bit like saving steak for later. Just use your battery while its chemistry allows it (2-3 year time frame, about 500 charge cycles) because the losses you'll have after that period will put your "savings" to shame. It's just not worth it.	amostrespectableuser	t1_d8mi0lf

t3_56uouq	t1_d8nckv6	1476196731	Many people already said it, but just charge and discharge your battery at will.  There's a microchip inside the iPhone's battery (or almost any other battery, actually) that controls the internals and makes sure everything is optimal.  I'll give you an oversimplified example, but come with me. Imagine you go from 100% to 10%. Than you charge it back to 100%. That 10% is holding energy for more time than the other 90%, since it still has the energy from the previous charging you did. The microchip inside the battery knows this. So when taking energy from the battery, it will take it from that 10% first.  This way it prevents any damage from holding energy for a long time without cycling.  No matter what you do, the microchip is doing its best to optimize the internals of the battery. And it's smarter than you.	bighi	t3_56uouq

t3_5704lq	t1_d8nv81r	1476219609	I've had this issue recently too, just been doing fully discharge to 0% for a few days and it's gotten a lot better. If you don't get to 0, just charge for a bit until you can turn on, then keep discharging until you reach 0.  Also after a full discharge, fully charge to 100%, leave for an hour, then do a hard reset (hold power and home for a few seconds until phone reboots to apple logo).   After doing this for a few days in a row my battery meter seemed to finally get calibrated again.	makeramen	t3_5704lq

t3_58cn04	t1_d8zavk2	1476910403	I saw an ad for one of these and they immediately caught my attention. There are a few Chinese variants of the same concept, and some name brands ones, I got one for a decent price on an online store.   The idea is simple: You have a tiny little connector that's always on your lightning port, and then a cable that's got a strong magnet that attaches to this connector, its very similar to MagSafe on a Mac. If you look at your lightning cable you might see some oxidation on the pins, this cable prevents that from happening inside your port and also prevents dirt from getting inside. It's extremely practical because as soon as the cable gets close to the phone the magnets make it snap perfectly into place. My particular model also has an LED that shows if the phone is fully charged or not.   I use an UAG case, and everything fits perfectly inside the cutout for charging, it's not big enough to interfere with most cases, and I only know the connector is there if I look at it.   Overall, it's a really nice idea and works great, it's nice to use and prevents damage to the phone. The only thing is for iPhone 7 users that use the lightning headphones it would be a problem, you would probably lose the connector as its very tiny.   EDIT: Also, my unit does have an MFI chip so iOS never complains about that. There are cheaper versions, but they might trigger annoying alerts or not work at all.	kadupse	t3_58cn04

t3_58cn04	t1_d8zgk4n	1476917489	The main security chips are on the phone itself and the charger, the cable plays a role but nothing major. iOS also blocks charging when something weird happens with the voltage or current. Some of these are also made by famous brands, it's not like there's only one magnetic cable in the world.	kadupse	t1_d8zgdrt
t3_58cn04	t1_d8zgmuj	1476917586	As I said, I bought it on a Brazilian store that only ships to Brazil. I can provide the link if you want it though. There are many sellers on Ebay selling the same cable, some original, some Chinese.	kadupse	t1_d8zgjzn

t3_58cn04	t1_d8zh25f	1476918149	It's a little larger on the outside, so you can pull it out using your fingernails or some other thin object. It won't come out pulling the cable though.	kadupse	t1_d8zgube
t3_58cn04	t1_d8zhe3n	1476918616	This post just reminded me that I got in on a kickstarter for this same type of thing. I moved and never received my item.   It was this company: https://znaps-store.myshopify.com/	bbbdddeee	t3_58cn04
t3_58cn04	t1_d8zhp3b	1476919048	That's too bad! Where are you located? Some places have laws that can make the company give back the money if the product isn't what they said it would be (Or if they didn't ship it within the time they said they would).	kadupse	t1_d8zhe3n

t3_58cn04	t1_d8zk1nj	1476922336	My experience is that the magnet fills up with random magnetic debris and is almost impossible to clean, leading to a charging connection that is spotty at best, which unseen leads to uncharged phones and angry users.   Cool idea; doesn't make the long term.	Torger083	t3_58cn04
t3_58cn04	t1_d8zk8vr	1476922600	In the one I have, the piece on device isn't magnetic, the magnets are inside the charging cable. There, they are flat and the charging pins are non-magnetic copper, this way, if anything gets inside you can easily remove it, and even if the entire magnet is compromised the pins are still conductive. Plus, these cables are very cheap, so if after months of use they stop working I wouldn't really mind it.	kadupse	t1_d8zk1nj
t3_58cn04	t1_d8zkc7o	1476922721	I had the one in the picture. I ended up pitching it in the trash for not working.	Torger083	t1_d8zk8vr

t3_58cn04	t1_d8znh7p	1476926667	This seems super amazingly nice, but my issue is charging in a car or with my i7 where I need headphones.   Great invention for 6S and back though.	GamerRadar	t3_58cn04

t3_58cn04	t1_d8zpauv	1476928453	I have an UAG case, if don't have short fingernails then you can easily remove the tiny connector even with a case,  otherwise you would need something to pull it out or actually removing the case first. For iPhone 7 users that might not be very practical.	kadupse	t1_d8zn6os
t3_58cn04	t1_d8zpe4g	1476928556	Thanks for the input. I just love the convenience of the magnet!	christofermario	t1_d8zpauv
t3_58cn04	t1_d8zpfkb	1476928599	You won't get your money back. You might get your product although the reports from the very few people that have gotten a Znaps so far is that the magnet is way weaker than prototyped, the device is NOT MiFi certified (even though a stretch goal was to get MiFi certification) and that the project creators have already started the same project again on Idiegogo.	tsdguy	t1_d8zicq6
t3_58cn04	t1_d8zpi1q	1476928668	Not me. I have over $500 in projects that have not or never will ship on Kickstarter. And $300 on Idiegogo.  I will NEVER, EVER participate in group projects again.	tsdguy	t1_d8znoha

t3_58cn04	t1_d8zpog6	1476928852	It's really practical. And I prefer the combination of the magnet plus a case, as it naturally hides the little connector that otherwise could be annoying.	kadupse	t1_d8zpe4g

t3_58fboc	t1_d8zzpvz	1476944210	Only 7 Plus that was available on pre-order day for me at 128gb or higher was the 256gb, 128gb was sold out so I opted for 256gb.  My previous 128gb 6 Plus always had around 5-10gb free.  I have a lot of podcast HD videos stored on my phone, around 50gb of music and I work for a SatNav company so lots of apps for testing with large maps, so I had to go with 128gb or higher.  With 256gb I have around 130gb free, I doubt I'll use it all but hey at least I'm not going to run out of space anytime soon.	DaveFalcon73	t3_58fboc
t3_58fboc	t1_d900a07	1476945673	Photos and videos, from my drone and GoPro plus the iPhone itself.  I back everything up on Google photos and iCloud but like keeping originals on my phone for quick access to them and not having to wait for them to stream	09qsk	t3_58fboc

t3_58fboc	t1_d901b5a	1476948669	I got it because i was too excited to wait a couple of weeks for the 128gb one! I do download a lot of TV shows though because out internet connection isn't always great for streaming.	elektrobix	t3_58fboc

t3_58fboc	t1_d907j06	1476967539	I got it for a couple reasons.   1) Because it was easier to get since people snatched up all the 128GB ones.  2) Now I don't have to even think about storage.  I can just go wild and do videos, pics and apps and never think, "Oh no...I'm running out of storage."	Musaab	t3_58fboc

t3_58fboc	t1_d909rqv	1476971320	I have Apple Music and prefer to not stream so I download music constantly as I find new stuff to listen to, so I'd prefer to not have to manage my storage and just let it fill up. Same goes for my podcasts. They take up a ton of space and I listen to many podcasts so they fill up my phone when I download them.   Same goes for photos. They take up a fair chunk. It's also nice to just download that take up a lot of space and just keep them on your phone instead of uninstalling and reinstalling it when I want to play it.   In the end it's just comfort, peace of mind, convenience, and the fact that it was only $4 more a month and I got a great promotional deal on a trade in toward my phone, so it was a no brainer to go 256 for me.	MAGGLEMCDONALD	t3_58fboc
t3_58fboc	t1_d909un6	1476971438	I got it because why not? The price difference for me from the 128gb was $3 a month. I'll use it mostly for media as the others have stated. However, it's important to note that for solid-state storage, it's crucial to leave 30% of your storage as free space to allow the drive to function properly. Otherwise it will slowly slow down. I'm sure many have experienced this with the 16gb models.	bentspog	t3_58fboc

t3_58fboc	t1_d90a1fi	1476971719	Honestly... I probably don't I grabbed it because it was the only black plus I could get anywhere near me and I am impatient...

t3_58fboc	t1_d90awb9	1476972898	It's because there's physically more flash storage to write to, surely? It's the same with SSDs.	BretticusWins	t1_d904t0w
t3_58fboc	t1_d90azi6	1476973016	I got the iPhone 7+ 256gb because it saved me a month of waiting over the 128gb according to Best Buy website. I ended up getting it a week after I ordered in the last week of September so I didn't mind at all	Juas003	t3_58fboc
t3_58fboc	t1_d90biw2	1476973714	Same. Optimize storage with iCloud Photo Library works fine for photos but it always takes way too long to pull down videos for me, even on good WiFi.	SoSquidTaste	t1_d9021g9
t3_58fboc	t1_d90ch7g	1476974936	I walked into a store the day after launch and the choice was either 256g or 32.   I was hoping for 128 and would have settled for 64.  My 16g was a constant battle of deleting photos and apps to make room for more.  I was sick of it.    In hindsight, i suspect 32g would have been OK for at least a year, but at least this way I never have to think about deleting anything.	bunbunbunnybun	t3_58fboc
t3_58fboc	t1_d90cp6t	1476975220	Yup, same here. Buy the 256GB Jet Black 7+ now, wait for the 128GB to show up in stores, or wait for my 128GB December 1-14 order.	myheaditches	t1_d8zzp8s

I want the 256GB so I don't have to worry about this for a while.  I am not a big fan of streaming music, both because it requires data or wifi, and because I want to OWN the files I listen to so they can't be taken away from me (e.g. RDIO).	fresh_dan	t1_d90kug9
t3_58fboc	t1_d90llu5	1476985840	A very large music library because renting music is for suckas. Also, lots of photos, and I'm guessing 4K video, live photos, and 12mp photos will eat up a lot of space pretty quickly.	entropicamericana	t3_58fboc

t3_58fboc	t1_d90so84	1476994439	I don't have this phone, but if I could afford it I would definitely get this much storage. I constantly have problems with not enough storage with a 64gb phone.

t3_58fboc	t1_d90to3l	1476995658	Last year I went from a 16GB iPhone 6 to a 64GB iPhone 6s Plus. I thought that would've been plenty of room but I managed to fill it up quickly with a lot of music and pictures/videos. I was desperate for space since like May, so I decided to go with the 256GB iPhone 7 Plus. I'm at about 85 GB used up already.  I figured it gives me much more freedom with how much music I save, and photos/videos I can take.

t3_58fboc	t1_d91sha8	1477060986	I got the 256 GB phone because:   - I like having a decent collection of off-line music, podcasts, and shows available (I take Metro to work and don't get reception in the tunnels so having stuff offline is important).   - I take a lot of pictures and videos (kid, amateur iphoneography stuff, etc).   - I love trying out apps, so I always have a ton on my iPhone.   My Iphone is really my primary productivity and life tool. I don't use an iPad and even for work I just use a basic PC that is more netbook (because everything is on the cloud). Because of how much I use my iPhone, getting the biggest capacity was a no brainer. I do use cloud stuff (Dropbox and Google Drive primarily), but I still wanted to make sure I could keep a fair amount of data on my iPhone.	Wdc331	t3_58fboc

t3_58nq20	t1_d91w5n3	1477065688	It's been happening to me since I've updated to iOS 10.0.1. I'm not sure how widespread this issue is, but I've seen a few posts about this on Reddit recently. I've restored my phone twice between iOS 10.0.1 and iOS 10.0.2 and nothing has changed either time. I really hope this gets fixed soon.	PassionatelyInnocent	t3_58nq20
t3_58nq20	t1_d91w92d	1477065808	It *seems* like it has to do with music the phone *thinks* you "downloaded" because it will sometimes show that I have downloaded Blond when I definitely did not download it to my phone in that way. Perhaps that's why?	haffbaked	t1_d91w5n3
t3_58nq20	t1_d91wvwr	1477066621	Now that apple has stopped supporting iTunes on my 8 year old Macbook, i'm switching back to Google Music, because at least then i'll be able to use my phone to listen to music.  So no more of this itunes bullshit for me!	aDDnTN	t3_58nq20

t3_58nq20	t1_d91ynye	1477068903	It was happening to me too. Not 100% sure why, but only ever tracks I purchased legally. Long story short, use iTunes to convert to a new AAC file, delete the old one, sync the new one and it will never happen again.	MattAlbie60	t3_58nq20

t3_58nq20	t1_d92ap3q	1477084282	Well the thing is I did **not** download the album through iTunes. I had it on my laptop, moved it into itunes and then synced it to my phone.   I just noticed that sometimes my phone will say that the album was "downloaded" which is incorrect but might be the reason it is deleting songs?	haffbaked	t1_d92aefp

t3_58pwe5	t1_d92db47	1477088152	It basically just comes down to personal preference, but if you drop your phone as much as it sounds like you do, then you might want to keep it in a case.  But there are other factors to look at to.  How long are you planning to keep the phone?  Do you plan on selling it?  Will you have moderately good insurance on it that covers accidental damage?  Do a few scratches and chips bother you?  If you're planning to sell it, having a case on it will possibly give your phone a higher selling price.  If you plan on keeping it for 2-3 years, then damage won't be as big of a factor unless you don't like scratches and the like on your phone.  I love the feel of most phones without any case, but I generally keep mine in cases just to prevent any minor damage and maximize the amount I can get for it when I decide to sell.  I usually take my case off while I'm at home though, as I really have no worries about damaging it there.	ferrari91169	t3_58pwe5

t3_58pwe5	t1_d92e1l1	1477089326	I go back and forth. I loved the 3gs feel in the hand. I like the 6s as well.  I went caseless a lot on my 5s and it really lasted a long time, even still works for the most part today, but I definitely killed the re-sell value of it being caseless.     Definitely takes more drops with a case, and I sport a battery case a lot. I have a nice, slim clear case I run with sometimes too- but a LOT of the time my 6s is naked.   A glass screen protector is a must regardless.	flickerkuu	t3_58pwe5
t3_58pwe5	t1_d92e319	1477089391	29$!?!   For a 6s?   Where do you get that price?  It was going above $100 last time I checked.	flickerkuu	t1_d92d75n

t3_58pwe5	t1_d92e5ht	1477089500	Yeah, when you forget your keys in your pocket and it sends a three inch slash across the screen, you get a new one for free or $15.  Also, it will crack and take a lot of pressure before your screen does with a pressure point.	flickerkuu	t1_d92dmlc
t3_58pwe5	t1_d92e9au	1477089673	That's my whole thing, I had a 16gb SE in immaculate condition that I sold after 6 months to get the 7.. and it was definitely nice to get a good price for it since it was practically in like new condition.. but I'm thinking I might hold on to this one for a few years since I got the 128gb so storage is no longer an issue. So it doesn't really matter as much if it stays perfect	i91809	t1_d92db47
t3_58pwe5	t1_d92ef9g	1477089942	I love my naked iPhone.   I really only use a case when I go out. Like if I'm driving to get fast food, or just anywhere super close that I frequent, I'll go without a case. But anything else like going to the mall, work, families house or out of town I'll put on a case.   Sometimes I'll do all that without a case but I'll still have one with me in my bag.	poorlilthing	t3_58pwe5
t3_58pwe5	t1_d92glt5	1477093541	For sure man. They are probably about as durable as your phone's screen and give you a safety net. I've never used a case but used to agonize over dropping it. Everybody drops their phone their phone, no matter how careful, and this gives you a redo (or as many as you're willing to buy or warranty) for way cheaper than the screen. Although that guy that said 29 dollar screen repair, look into that.	PsySom	t1_d92dmlc

My i7 which is not even 2 months old already has this due to the stupid camera bump....  I bought a cheap bestbuy case (w.e their brand is).

t3_58r200	t1_d92llzc	1477102529	I want to get this repaired by Apple and not a 3rd party business. I bought it about 2 months ago, without AppleCare+. Would I still have to pay the $129 fee or is there a warranty that I'm still covered by for this? Thank you.	_AMuse_	t3_58r200
t3_58r200	t1_d92ls5h	1477102845	Applecare+ got updated so it is $29 for screen replacements as long as it does not interfere with the logic board or anything besides the glass itself.	DudeThatsErin	t1_d92llzc
t3_58r200	t1_d92n3tw	1477105368	All phones come with 1 year of Applecare+ included. It is the 1 year manufacturer's warranty that all devices have.  So, yes, he does... for the first year only though.	DudeThatsErin	t1_d92mezl
t3_58r200	t1_d92n40o	1477105378	Really depends who you get and if they feel bad for you. Technically speaking you didn't crack the display, but that's pretty much the same thing. Hopefully they show you some mercy and repair as if you have Apple Care.	Macintoshmar	t3_58r200
t3_58r200	t1_d92n600	1477105487	AppleCare+ must be purchased extra unless you're on the iPhone upgrade plan. The basic Applecare service is 1 year included, but doesn't cover physical damage.	Macintoshmar	t1_d92n3tw
t3_58r200	t1_d92nf4z	1477106000	This is false. All iPhones come with an AppleCare limited 1-year warranty. AppleCare+ must be purchased at time of sale or within 60 days of the purchase of the phone.	jessicaho656	t1_d92n3tw
t3_58r200	t1_d92osam	1477108652	AppleCare is something else. The one that comes with phones doesn't cover you breaking your screen.	Rsidhuu	t1_d92n3tw
t3_58r200	t1_d92p7a1	1477109533	Oh how it angers me to see people unknowingly spread false information on the internet.  No. no iPhones come with AppleCare+ (---see the PLUS sign? That's different from AppleCare (no PLUS sign)) for free.  If every iPhone came with AppleCare+ and screen replacements for all were $29 in the first year, my business would be demolished. Hence, that is not the case.	phonetechguru4	t1_d92n3tw
t3_58r200	t1_d92ptew	1477110868	If this is a "hairline crack" (and it looks like it is) and there's no damage on the body of the phone, apple will replace it for free. (Because hairline cracks are usually a manufacturing defect rather than actual user damage)  Also, if it's been less than 60 days, you can still buy AppleCare+ if you want.	JD404	t3_58r200
t3_52zlrw	t1_d94oeal	1477254863	just did this - it works! thanks so much.  for those of you overwhelmed by the above video, it's really easy. open up your phone and remove the metal shield shown around 1:15 in the video. open that up, put a folded piece of electric tape there, then screw back the plate, close up the phone, and voila - you have a working phone again.	hirst	t1_d7ow2rl

Maybe it's hopeless but sooner or later Apple will realize consumers don't appreciate their devices being regularly overhauled for the sake of a bullet point at their press conferences.    The largest software company in the world could easily provide security updates for at least the past major version, if not all of them. They don't to keep you in the upgrade cycle.

t3_59fg5d	t1_d981r81	1477453087	I have a pixel XL pre order for late November and I've been restling with possibly getting an iPhone 7 plus, if only Apple had at least bezels like 1+3 I'd be instant buy.... Anyways I'm still considering it, only problem is I am on tmobile. So I'd have to go straight thru apple to get Qualcom modem.   P. S. How'd u get a Qualcom modem with your iPhone 7 plus?!	_Ozz_	t3_59fg5d
t3_59fg5d	t1_d981xvn	1477453370	Are you currently paying for any phone right now? If not, I would look into Apple's Upgrade program. You would need to bring in your T-Mobie login information, credit card, and driver's license. For me, after tax and all, I pay roughly $45/month for my iPhone 7 Plus 256GB, and can trade it in after 12 months of payment (For the next phone then, I would pay taxes of the phone, and whatever the monthly cost is). It came out to roughly the same costs of paying from T-Mobile (For them, it was roughly $30 a month with $15 for Jump On-Demand and insurance).    At the end of the day, Apple's Upgrade program is a no-brainer, since it also includes Apple Care Plus. I would rather go through them to repair and/or upgrade my phone than T-Mobile.	Non-Polar	t1_d981r81
t3_59fg5d	t1_d9821m8	1477453536	Thanks for the review. This really gives me a good idea as to what device I want to pull the trigger on for this year. I usually update my smartphone at least once a year, and since the S7 Edge is off the table, I think I'll go iPhone 7 Plus for this round.	cocobandicoot	t3_59fg5d
t3_59fcie	t1_d983w81	1477456702	I wanna see these newer phones against the 6S. It would at least be closer but I still think the iPhone will beat them. SAD!	Methaxetamine	t1_d981fjy
t3_59fcie	t1_d9844ul	1477457157	Why would anyone get the pixel? It's priced the same as an iPhone, has 0 water resistance, is significantly slower and a slap in the face to all nexus users. Even comparing it to the older s7 it falls flat, and on top of that this ugly phone is exclusive to Verizon? As if the locked bootloader and Verizon handling the updates wasn't enough of a turn off.   Recipe for disaster. Simply a garbage phone that will be $300 cheaper by December. What person hates apple so much that they'd get this overpriced flagship from 2015? If the note 7 didn't explode I'm sure it would have done much worst.	Methaxetamine	t3_59fcie
t3_59fg5d	t1_d984xyp	1477458751	I'm also coming from the Note 7 and mostly agree with your post but if you lost 10-20% battery overnight you had something seriously wrong with your device.  Also, while the speakers on the 7+ are not as good as my Nexus 6p were they still are much better than any Samsung.  This is my first iPhone after being on Android since the HTC Evo and I have to admit I'm very impressed.  The Note 7 was a fantastic phone but my 7+ has made me completely forget about it.	kungpu	t3_59fg5d

t3_59fg5d	t1_d9867wa	1477461761	I ordered my 7+ and am also coming over as a heavy Android user. I am very excited to try iOS and the phone looks fantastic, but I am definitely disappointed in the whole modem ordeal. I had to order through T-Mobile so I am stuck with the Intel modem... I am really hoping it's not as bad as I think it's going to be.. or if I can someway switch over to the Sim free through T-Mobile or if Apple becomes super generous. Either way, I can't wait! Thanks for your review.	RipInPepz	t3_59fg5d

t3_59fcie	t1_d98704f	1477463876	Interesting bench mark. Probably had a lot to do with how developers optimize their apps for a certain platform but I was impressed by the iPhone keeping things in memory longer than the pixel.	slaytanic313	t3_59fcie
t3_59fcie	t1_d987e8r	1477465015	The Pixel XL is not exclusive to Verizon, Verizon is just the only carrier store who has it in their B&amp;M shops.  You can get it from Best Buy as well as directly from Google and it works on any carrier.	InvaderDJ	t1_d9844ul

t3_59fg5d	t1_d98hjgo	1477490984	&gt; 10-20% battery overnight you had something seriously wrong with your device.   That is not necessarily true. I have the S7E and loose about 10% battery over night. When I had the google back up wake lock, it was 25%. I have disabled everything in the background with EZ Disabler. I even factory reset my phone and cleared the cache.  The phone STILL drops 10% over night.	agent_philcoulson	t1_d984xyp
t3_59fcie	t1_d98hrli	1477491290	If you watch the test, the pixel is actually winning in all things that aren't extremely graphics intensive.  Up until photoshop the iphone is losing by quite a bit.	sagan96	t1_d981fjy
t3_59fcie	t1_d98hxpt	1477491525	I wouldn't call it significantly slower?  It's slower at opening photoshop and games, but it's definitely fast at opening every day apps, facebook, snapchat, the browser etc.  Watch the test, the iphone is losing until graphics comes into play.  Also I think you're being a bit harsh overall.  The phone has a great, extremely fast camera, amazing image stabilization, amazing battery life for an android, quick charging, quad HD display etc.  There's still a bunch of reasons to get it, as it is the best stock android experience one can get right now.  I think the iphone 7 plus edges it for sure, but you're acting like this thing is a piece of shit.  If it comes to buying an android device, this is right their with the s7 edge, and software wise destroys every android because of how clean it runs stock android.  It also isn't only locked to verizon, they're the only carrier that carries the phone in their store.	sagan96	t1_d9844ul
t3_59fcie	t1_d98i06o	1477491619	Not only that, but the Pixel was far behind in memory management. It couldn't hold a single app running in the background, while the 7 plus had all of them.	Goldfish1_	t1_d98hrli
t3_59fcie	t1_d98j5q2	1477493147	$$$ basically. Nexus gave a stock experience with an unlocked bootloader and I remember my cousin had even asked me to buy one (nexus 4) to bring to China. It was constantly sold out so no chance of that, a top tier android phone even convinced him to save up a month or so worth of wages!  It is sad. The pixel brand I will always associate with overpriced junk (seriously a chrome book more expensive than a mac).	Methaxetamine	t1_d98gzsu
t3_59fcie	t1_d98jedd	1477493454	https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rxI1yWm76OI  I think the oneplus 3 is comparable for cheaper but just an opinion.	Methaxetamine	t1_d98hxpt

t3_59fcie	t1_d98n0rx	1477497837	While agree in a very up front sense, I think us apple customers can agree that the 24/7 support the pixel provides is also a huge benefit.  You need support for your oneplus 3, good luck.	sagan96	t1_d98jedd
t3_59fcie	t1_d98nl0u	1477498513	Agreed.  At that price though... I'd rather get an iPhone since there are apple stores and better support anyway.	Methaxetamine	t1_d98n0rx
t3_59fcie	t1_d98no19	1477498612	Agreed.  I don't think it's on the iphone's level as of yet, but when you compare it to its competition, it's a clear front runner for android phones.	sagan96	t1_d98nl0u
t3_59fcie	t1_d98nq8y	1477498685	Front runner? What exactly is it better than?	Methaxetamine	t1_d98no19
t3_59fcie	t1_d98o42b	1477499129	the S7 edge:  * stock android &gt; touch whiz * battery life better on the pixel * two screen options * better finger print sensor and better finger print sensor use (use to pull down notifications) * unlimited google cloud storage with no compression of quality * new integrated google assistant * faster camera * 24/7 on phone support * no bloatware  -Samsung has waterproofing which is better.  For the HTC 10, oneplus 3, 6P and so on, see the above reasons and obviously substitute the relevant attribute to that phone. (e.g. htc sense for touch whiz etc.).	sagan96	t1_d98nq8y
t3_59fg5d	t1_d98qrvy	1477502196	It'll be Intel if your EU.  China, Japan and US get the Qualcomm version. Anywhere else it'll be Intel.  I came from the iPhone 6 and with the same service provider, in the same locations I'm getting better connections so it doesn't seem to be that bad a deal. In my work place there were deadzones where I got no signal and now I get signal there.  Model number will tell you what you have (they are on the back of the phone) A1778 and A1784 are both  Intel modem chip. A1660 and A1661 are both Qualcomm modem chip.	Tiababy	t1_d986rw2
t3_59fcie	t1_d98quy5	1477502293	To me it seems like a hasty clone of the iPhone lineup. None of these are front runner features because a lot of them are just software (you can just run another rom with similar comparable features or more features). I always liked the nexus line and the pixel line just seems like overpriced products (that chromebook is ridiculous).  Android has always been about specs vs cost and I think the best one is probably the 1+ line now.	Methaxetamine	t1_d98o42b

Arrived at home". She thought Facebook gps was on and tracking her location. But when we checked location services, Facebook wasn't even in there. I was totally baffled as what she was talking about, or how to turn it off. We checked everywhere in her settings. Which is rare, I'm pretty tech savvy when it comes to Apple stuffs. Ended up transferring her to Apple support. I must've never noticed that on my phone. Welp, now I know for future references.   Edit: is there a way to turn it off??

Step 4: Release the Sleep/Wake + Volume Down button once you see the Connect to iTunes message appear on the iPhone 7’s screen.  Step 5: Launch iTunes, and you should see a message stating that “There is a problem with the iPhone that requires it to be updated or restored.”	PizzaHutHelps	t3_59mflf
t3_59ikti	t1_d99o2rd	1477549624	I love this feature too, especially since it suggests the clock to me every time I go to bed so I can adjust my alarm. 👌	teensie-tiny	t3_59ikti
t3_59mflf	t1_d99o8pt	1477550090	Phone was fully charged when it froz, been on the charger since. Tried the DFU mode earlier and iTunes won't recognize it.   Won't restart now, just a blank screen.  Gonna try walking into the Apple Store in the morning to see what they can do, I'm sure they have open appointments for walk in or 'emergency' issues if it were.	atomic92	t1_d99nyff

t3_59mflf	t1_d99odml	1477550483	I'm hoping,  pretty bizarre but I was browsing through posts on r/iPhone and I saw about 3 other people who had the exact same or similar issue either today or within the past couple hours.   Boot loop, won't recover and can't be recognized by iTunes.	atomic92	t1_d99oblk
t3_59mflf	t1_d99p7pj	1477553019	Is your iTunes up to date? You need to be running 12.5.1 for iTunes to recognize the iPhone 7. If you are up to date, you may need to install the proper drivers in order for iTunes to recognize it.	Lars_El	t1_d99o8pt

t3_59ikti	t1_d99sdcw	1477563942	At one point, iOS would suggest my sleep tracking app when I woke up – back when I had a regular sleep/wake schedule in school. It would have that little banner and say 'Good morning, *name*'.	owleaf	t1_d98qvoy
t3_59mflf	t1_d99t1lp	1477566107	Yup, my phone is the same except it has never worked after it showed the restore screen. And all this happened after i logged out of icloud, but maybe that was coincedental timing. Apple support tried everything they could to see what was wrong with my computer, of which there was none. So I'm seeing an apple store this weekend, although I am pissed there seems to be more people than I thought with this problem and almost no knowledge of it in tech support.	thestruggled	t3_59mflf
t3_59mflf	t1_d99tb4j	1477566886	I just tried using Apple Support chat.  They said the phone has to turn on and I must be pressing the wrong button....   Then they got frustrated and said I need to schedule an appointment for Saturday to have the store take a look at it.    I am just gonna walk in today to see if they can help, can't and don't really want to wait until Saturday to get help on this.	atomic92	t1_d99t1lp

t3_59ikti	t1_d99u7xc	1477569256	ah ok. I thought this was showing that the suggested apps works even after a restore, meaning it follows the Apple ID or something.    The only time i swipe close an app is when it's behaving badly. If I had to do that all the time I would go mad.	jonny-	t1_d99iyau

t3_59ikti	t1_d99v8qg	1477571498	Do you get a similar message on the bottom of your screen? I've never seen it on my iPad but Siri App Suggestions does show Narwhal pretty consistently in Widgets.	UmbrellaCo	t1_d99awjj
t3_59ikti	t1_d99vjbn	1477572073	Arg! I kept doing that on accident, so I disabled it. My hands aren't that small, and I don't have a 7+, so it isn't a problem for me.	jonlucc	t1_d99utlc
t3_59ikti	t1_d99xbk9	1477575150	Pretty much - long and a little harder. Then, for the highlighting, press a little harder still without releasing the first press. It's across the OS so try it on everything...most os elements have some feature through that.	Ezl	t1_d99p3pi
t3_59ikti	t1_d99yxdo	1477577581	On iOS it doesn't help much, but on Android stuff like that is a common reason for battery drain.	1s2_2s2_2p2	t1_d99tqqj

t3_59ikti	t1_d99zmfy	1477578560	Yes, it shows up for me on the bottom left of the lock screen and on the bottom of the app switcher.	emgirgis95	t1_d99v8qg
t3_59mflf	t1_d9aif2y	1477601518	Nope, appointment is Saturday. Might of had to do with the announcement today and the chaos that I assume would be in the store.	atomic92	t1_d9ahoyk

t3_59qx3o	t1_d9ang5o	1477608389	True that dude. I actually tried to make a post a couple days after iOS 10 launched saying that my iPad was much slower after the update, and if anyone else was with a 4th gen iPad was facing any issues. Lo and behold, the damn bot removed it	LightsOut5774	t1_d9an2n9
t3_59qx3o	t1_d9anz9x	1477609173	Yeah. I also like that people here are more understanding that it's not always about Apple. You know, like it's possible for someone to have an iPhone and still use Windows PCs.	mmaireenehc	t3_59qx3o

t3_59qx3o	t1_d9au5vh	1477618232	As someone who does exactly this, and will continue to (as I see the importance of MacOS declining in Apple's vision, which admittedly is purely speculative. That said, convergence of mobile and desktop is happening across the board, and Apple would be wise to not ignore such trends...), it works out great for me.	Atlas26	t1_d9anz9x

t3_59qx3o	t1_d9avnlq	1477620338	I see that as well. I have both an iPhone and an android and I like to read up on both regarding to news, experiences people have, and so on.  Lots of negativity there lol	Rickdrizzle	t3_59qx3o
t3_59qx3o	t1_d9ax9kt	1477622635	Former /r/Android dude. When I switched to the 7 I went over to /r/Apple and was immediately disappointed with how technically ignorant they were over there (and very troll-y).   Very happy I found this place.	trumpetmuppet	t3_59qx3o
t3_59qx3o	t1_d9az8c3	1477625702	The first day I switched to iOS from Android (Nexus/Samsung Refugee) I visited the Apple sub. No way would I stay there. I found this sub by accident too having found the iOS 10 beta sub and learning how to download the betas (I got my phone with 9.2 so I was anxious to try 10)  So thank you too all the people here that make this place decent and less elitist	tensai_76	t3_59qx3o
t3_59qx3o	t1_d9b12hb	1477628892	I post in /r/apple, /r/iphone and /r/ipad. There are some great people in all of them, but there are bad ones too.   It's funny that you've posted this after today's event, as a quick look over in /r/apple right now highlights the problem it has with people who defend Apple and their products like it's their job. And I really mean "like it's their job". People posting dozens of times a day, every day for years. Literally thousands of posts, and not a single one of them contains a remotely negative comment about Apple. Even in the face of legitimate issues they will spin it around. You start to recognise them after a while, and I could name at least six off the top of my head to prove my point. But that would be against the rules, and would ultimately be unfair.   I guess people are entitled to their opinions. They aren't entitled to be quite as snarky and downright aggressive about it though.   For what it's worth, such people are in the minority. And the mods are great. You very often see people going waaaaay to far. But within minutes the posts are gone.	dfuqt	t3_59qx3o
t3_59qx3o	t1_d9b12pd	1477628904	They should do a poll and see how many users truly own a recent macbook. There's so much whining...	SgtPepe	t1_d9as8s2

t3_59qx3o	t1_d9b25iz	1477631010	If the bot hadn't removed it you would have been downvoted to oblivion anyway. Hissing iPhones, performance issues, battery problems, comments on low light camera performance - nobody wants to talk about that. But you post a simple statement that Apple are great, and that's your karma for the year sorted right there.	dfuqt	t1_d9ang5o

t3_59qx3o	t1_d9b5bd7	1477638793	Better but not great. Today they downvoted someone for saying they use juice cards to add data and saying you shouldn't have and iPhone if you don't have a data plan. I was downvoted for being able to pay my own phone bill. Many more you'll see.   The nicest one is by far /r/jailbreak	Methaxetamine	t3_59qx3o
t3_59qx3o	t1_d9b5id3	1477639389	I would argue, no. At least, the changes from the SP 3 to 4 was way better than the upgrade for the new macbook	T-Nan	t1_d9b2smg
t3_59qx3o	t1_d9b674g	1477641563	I think part of the problem is that every time there is a major Apple announcement (like the one just gone) a ton of people come to read the sub. Unfortunately, some of them come to just argue how terrible Apple are (sometimes for reasonable reasons, like wanting their headphone jacks [I'm on the fence there. Its probably a touch too early really, but someone major has to make the leap, and if Apple doesn't, I don't think anyone will really go for it] to unreasonable ones like "OMG the retina MacBooks only have core-M processors and that means they are shit."), and that - particularly the latter - gets people's hackles up.  Do I like *everything* Apple has ever done, or even everything they've done in the last couple of years? No. For one, they've really got to clean up their naming scheme across their products (the MacBooks are getting there with the death of the 11 inch MBA - although the absolute bottom end new MBP doesn't help things much), particularly in the iPad line - iPad Mini (one size), iPad Air (one size), iPad Pro (two sizes, one of which is the same as the Air). Get your shit together! And I would like the Cheese Grater back too. Yeah, the Trash Can looks neat, but it isn't as extendable as the Grater was.  But on the whole, they're doing pretty good.	astalavista114	t1_d9b12hb
t3_59qx3o	t1_d9b6b8x	1477641945	Let me guess - WWDC, when they *always* highlight that the majority of the Apple Userbase are on the latest version of their OSes (and that users of other OSes are not) to encourage devs (which is primarily who they are presenting to) to use the new features they are announcing?  A couple of times at other events they've done about 30 seconds on sales numbers and just said "Well, we sold a shit tonne of products and everyone is using 10.WhateverTheMostRecentVersionIs and iOS Whichever. Here's new stuff!", and therefore they should always do that. Right?	astalavista114	t1_d9b2bdj
t3_59qx3o	t1_d9b76ee	1477644945	Sometimes I think /r/apple is made up of more android users than iPhone users. It's almost like it's a sub to hate on apple	mayaisme	t3_59qx3o
t3_59qx3o	t1_d9b7e4z	1477645722	To be fair, the SP3 needed a *lot* of improvements to deal with its issues. Performance and spec wise, I actually quite like the SP4, and I think it's a fantastic device, but it's not the right device for me (Windows is the killer, unfortunately - although I do have a desktop running Windows for when I need it). (sosumi)  As for judging whether the improvements are worth it for the MBP - I'll have to wait and see what the reviewers say. There's Apple's claimed performance improvements which are pretty damn good, but those are probably under optimal conditions. As for connectivity - put it like this: It's well suited for the future. 4 TB3 ports (so 2 5K monitors? Why not?), although power is also provided through there as well (so long MagSafe!), so if you don't have an external device that can also power over that connection (some monitors can, for instance), you'll need one of the ports to provide power to the MacBook itself. But in the here and now, it's a bit like the headphone jack on the iPhone - probably a year or two too soon, but because they've done it others will follow, making the change to USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 actually happen (hopefully).	astalavista114	t1_d9b5id3
t3_59qx3o	t1_d9b92lm	1477651611	I would argue yes. Basically the same price spec wise. Likely better build quality. Much better trackpad and keyboard. Bigger and better quality screen. 4 thunderbolt 3 ports. Much faster storage. Runs macOS. I suppose if you really want to use it as a tablet it wins but from what I've heard it's not very good at being a tablet.	iranintoavan	t1_d9b2smg
t3_59qx3o	t1_d9b9gu7	1477652822	One of the massive flaws of Reddit is that there can only be one /r/Apple, and all subreddits are governed by moderators who are unaccountable and unelected. It's nearly impossible to track and question moderator decisions unless they happen to you.   And some subreddits have an enormous amount of power.	tombiscuit	t3_59qx3o
t3_59qx3o	t1_d9b9nph	1477653393	Trust me, it's mostly because trolls use /r/apple. Around any keynote or product launch it's basically impossible to have any sort of real reaction from Apple fans, as it's all people from other subs coming to say the same things over and over.

t3_59qx3o	t1_d9bj0yp	1477669004	Probably better to compare the Surface Book to the MacBook Pro really, since both are laptops first. Especially when both have base models at the same price point. (Though you can go cheaper on the Surface Book if you go with half the storage.)  With the Surface you're passing on the dedicated GPU in the keyboard at that price point. With the MBP you're passing on the Touch Bar and getting half as many Thunderbolt ports	neoookami	t1_d9b2smg

I forget the question, but one of the comments was like (paraphrasing), "You know, if questions like these frequent the Subreddit too much, then it becomes bland and useless; if they don't have the sense to use the search feature, then they're dumb."

t3_59uezx	t1_d9d5e3r	1477773709	I have created an iMessage sticker app called ​ [Put A Bird On It](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/put-a-bird-on-it/id1166314424?ls=1&amp;mt=8) (I am sure some people will get the reference). Currently it allows you to select from 36 different bird silhouettes in 4 different colours.   There are more updates coming as well. I will be sending out an update shortly that will allow you to pick from solid coloured silhouettes, or textured ones, followed by additional colours as well. As this is the first customizable iMessage sticker app I have done I am still seeing what all can be done with them and welcome any feedback you might have.	Third_beach	t3_59uezx

t3_59uezx	t1_d9eo115	1477873430	Good start. Some of my observations:   * I have to buy the app just to log in? Poor start, for me at least.  * I would either remove the swiping actions within a thread, or add an option for gestures. I don't click on everything in a sub and navigating to a post I don't know is pretty annoying. Add gestures for voting, or just a swipe in general to return to the subreddit page.  * The overflow button is always super clunky to use. I would find a new way to vote, favorite, etc to posts.  * The tab should be customizable. I regularly go to a select few subreddits, but am still subscribed to a lot. I would like to be able to have my favorites at the top of one of the lists.  * No force touch? Such a huge downfall.	Bearly_Dead	t1_d9bya8g
t3_5a362v	t1_d9eou88	1477874473	i also had the very same bug. I contacted support. They advised me two things. 1 restore and set up as new phone and 2 when it goes dark again plug in in charger and then start it up and take it out of the charger instantly. Then use the phone all the way until 0% then charge it to 100% and leave it in the charger for two hours after it reached 100%. It worked for me, no issues any more.	monkeypack	t1_d9dq8ao

t3_59uezx	t1_d9f4qf2	1477906254	Bought the IAP just to try it. Visually, it's a very 'clean' app but navigating some areas is a bit of a pain -- why do subreddits need to be in block icons? Why not give an option to view them as a list? Also, getting to the messages inbox is not intuitive since it's buried in another menu (you have to tap the person icon on the upper left hand corner). I prefer [Beam](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beam-for-reddit/id937987469?mt=8) for now.	Eisenhorn76	t1_d9bya8g
t3_59uezx	t1_d9f5lmy	1477909570	Great job with the app. Once a picture is opened or a video watch is there an option to turn on swipe to go back? I'm on a 7+, when using a single hand I always have to double tap home to get to that "done" button	UltraWee	t1_d9bya8g
t3_59uezx	t1_d9f5p7b	1477909924	Also just noticed there is no way to edit a comment?  Haha! I know the app is called readder not commentter:-D	UltraWee	t1_d9ctdkj
t3_59uezx	t1_d9fba83	1477922789	Thanks for the great feedback.   * I think there are cases where swiping between links is very useful. I'm considering other options to bring up comment actions, one of which is 3D touch. For now, the "more" (overflow?) icon offers all that. A long swiping gesture from the left edge to the right should bring you back to the subreddit. * One of the tabs is "Recent", it should offer easy access to your most frequently accessed subreddits. * 3D touch is coming!	redreadder	t1_d9eo115
t3_59uezx	t1_d9fbdph	1477922936	Thanks /u/UltraWee! You can fling a picture to close the full screen mode without needing to reach the "done". No currently way of doing that for videos, but I'll give it some more thought.	redreadder	t1_d9f5lmy
t3_59uezx	t1_d9fbh4o	1477923067	Thanks for the feedback.   Viewing subreddits as a list will be available in the upcoming release.   I agree that the current location of the inbox isn't ideal and I'm still considering alternatives that won't sacrifice other aspects.	redreadder	t1_d9f4qf2

Step 1: On your iOS device, launch Safari, and open this link: bit.ly/29kVIjk. Step 2: Download the profile to your device by tapping the Download Now button. Step 3: If asked “on which device would you like to install this profile?” select iPhone. Step 4: In the screen that follows, hit Install. After the profile is installed, your device will be rebooted.  Copy/paste link from step 1 in Safari, and after closing a pop-up or two, I was prompted to pick my device.  Then just check for software updates, and good to go.	gumballhead1775	t1_d9g63nb

t3_59uezx	t1_d9gvwgn	1478013292	Can we stop having self promotions of apps in these fucking discovery threads? I come to find new apps that are creative or interesting and just see the same apps over and over again every week.  Make an "App Promotion" and "App Discovery" thread every week. This is so annoying. Be more like r/androidapps and actually promote interesting apps.  EDIT: https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/5ahl7y/weekly_android_game_suggestion_requests_1101/  Look at the difference even between AndroidGaming's thread and this.

t3_59uezx	t1_d9h22r0	1478020477	Yes there is, within Spark they are 'pins' - short swipe to the left to pin an email. Long swipe deletes emails, these gestures and right swipes can be changed.  Just make sure you have Pins enabled for the account in question.	yuhche	t1_d9gtkq6
t3_59uezx	t1_d9h2jft	1478021003	Don't know what I'm doing wrong then. Subscribed calendars and even normal calendars don't show up, I've allowed the app access to calendars. I have national holidays in the UK enabled in Gmail and Outlook but nothing shows up in the app unlike the native app.	yuhche	t1_d9cqkhp
t3_5ak1jm	t1_d9h36ta	1478021748	I have had both, and have the same Bluetooth issues.   I don't think the bluetooth and wifi and cellular radio chips are an all-in-one solution, so having a different cellular modem most likely doesn't affect it. It's most likely a driver issue and will hopefully be resolved via software updates eventually.	threwthisacctaway	t3_5ak1jm
t3_5ak1jm	t1_d9h3fi2	1478022030	Interesting. I've been skimming forums, and it seems like I've come across more folks with GSM versions reporting the issue. I was interested to assemble more data on the matter to see if that was true.	Cirkuit	t1_d9h36ta

t3_5ak1jm	t1_d9h5698	1478024031	I also thought the same thing, but and while I've never had a problem with audio fidelity or it being choppy/cut out, the source of my Bluetooth problems are with reconnecting automatically, or it randomly triggering what my Bluetooth device thinks is a voice activation prompt. My car shows this as "active call" when I use dictation or a phone call, and when I activate the head unit to start a voice command (which is a local command run on my head unit and not on the phone per se). It'll randomly think the phone has initiated something. Other issue I have to manually reconnect devices, my Apple watch keeps the connection fine, but other devices have the problem.	threwthisacctaway	t1_d9h3fi2
t3_5ak1jm	t1_d9h5v1c	1478024823	I also have an Apple Watch. I wonder if the issue could be with concurrent connections. I'm going to try turning off my watch and seeing if the audio issues remain.	Cirkuit	t1_d9h5698
t3_5aicb0	t1_d9h6v9a	1478025979	Looks really pretty. However, in real world usage, it won't be as nice but should still be protective enough compared to a naked JB iPhone.	SJUNLIN	t3_5aicb0

t3_5aicb0	t1_d9h9ydh	1478029553	The glass would shatter and probably damage the finish.	Methaxetamine	t1_d9h6v9a
t3_5aicb0	t1_d9h9zak	1478029582	They have a 1mm gap between the phone and the back to prevent moisture from showing the rainbow effect you see with normal plastic cases.  Moisture will still get in of course though  you hopefully just wont notice it.	sparkfist	t1_d9gn2nv
t3_5aicb0	t1_d9ha29r	1478029677	I REALLLY HOPE SO. This is probably the nicest looking phone case that i've ever seen. If they leave the logos and the text it would instead be the ugliest.	sparkfist	t1_d9gng1w
t3_5aicb0	t1_d9hags6	1478030144	Not all of them scratch that easily. I had a plastic case that I used in my old phone that was mostly scratch free. Plus it doesn't shatter like glass would.	Methaxetamine	t1_d9hae0v

I also like the basic icon too. I hate narwhal's icon so much I refuse to use the app even though it's a decent reddit app.	iMau5	t1_d9bya8g

One thing i miss is the SMS Backup + in Android which backs up your SMS, Call Logs and Whatsapp text to your Gmail account. Cant find anything similar in AppStore!  Any suggestions on a similar app?

t3_59uezx	t1_d9ibzy8	1478095090	Thanks for the kind words. The idea is to expand the functionality while maintaining the simplicity. There is no current way to filter out subreddits/posts from /r/all but I've received that request a few times and I'll see if I can get that in soon.	redreadder	t1_d9hsv5v
t3_59uezx	t1_d9iifme	1478103144	I'm a big fan of Inbox; mainly cause it aggregrates Trips together.	CisternaChyli	t1_d9c0kvc
t3_59uezx	t1_d9ir7ye	1478113223	I've been in favor of doing this for months and have posted the same request multiple times in these weekly posts, which are always upvoted. I really really wish they would change the rules. I'd much prefer a centralize place for users to promote apps they find and love.   I'm happy to look into new apps being promoted by devs, but there needs to be a separation. There is a big difference between App Discovery, and App Promotion. I think at lot of people would benefit from just sharing their favorite apps that they don't see widely discussed.   I'll say [Unroll.me](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unroll.me/id1028103039?mt=8) is one that I enjoy but don't see mentioned a lot. You pick which emails you want to continue to receive, and which you'd prefer to not have in your inbox and provides those emails into a daily (or weekly) rollup so you can look through them when you want.  I use it to declutter my inbox but still keep up with newsletters I may want to read eventually. It's fairly handy and works smoothly. Completely free and I've used it for a few months without a problem.	thebuggalo	t1_d9gvwgn
t3_59uezx	t1_d9itrk4	1478116168	From Product Hunt, I discovered Quadro. Same functionality with new MacBook Pros Touch Bar. It seems free but after signing up it says 14 days premium trial. I guess you won't be able to customize shortcuts after 14 days as you can do in premium. But this app is definitely worth to try: http://quadro.me/	butoo	t3_59uezx

t3_5az0pw	t1_d9kj4wl	1478206433	International fees are stupid high down here  Also, dont have a land line, just my smartphone, and I think even trying to call would eat all my credit	lulzzfinder	t1_d9kindh
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9kk05d	1478207495	You could SMS him a link to this thread.  If it costs too much, give me his number and I'll do it.	shamam	t1_d9kj4wl
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9kkgp0	1478208070	I tried sending a SMS, but I dont think it went through I sent it to 1 646 161 XXXX, dont know if I had to add more numbers Also, didnt show up on whatsapp or telegram	lulzzfinder	t1_d9kk05d
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9kkjx7	1478208183	That should work.  Have you been able to SMS US numbers in the past?	shamam	t1_d9kkgp0
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9kkkc9	1478208197	I live in New York and would be happy to try and call for you. PM me.  Also, Skype is a solid solution for avoiding fees on international calls.	trillgates	t3_5az0pw
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9knigf	1478212048	I believe it should be dialed like so: +1 646 161 XXXX. Atleast that's how I dial from Italy to USA, when I called so I assume the same for text.	NarpLife	t1_d9kkgp0
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9kq9fx	1478215803	A point: The 4th digit of a US phone number can never be a "1."  641 is the area code and "161" would be the, for lack of a better term, city code.  But that second set of three numbers can't start with a 1.	somenewuser	t3_5az0pw
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9ktvv6	1478220699	Are you certain "161" is correct?  That number must start with 2 or higher.	Lynucs	t1_d9kkgp0
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9ktwjy	1478220726	Didnt know that, I googled the number, nothing came back, so started to google the first few numbers and New York came back, so I figured the number was from that zone.  Maybe the number is from another part of the world then.	lulzzfinder	t1_d9kq9fx
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9kufuh	1478221458	Yes, well, at least that's what the message says  Dont know if it could be from somewhere else in the world, couldnt find another country that uses 646	lulzzfinder	t1_d9ktvv6
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9kuzyl	1478222207	Well, country code +64 is New Zealand and the Pitcairn Islands.  The phone number doesn't fit New Zealand's telephone number system and the Pitcairn Islands aren't exactly known for having a whole lot of phones, so...  I'm gonna go with somebody typo'd their mobile number and are now screwed.  If you're feeling generous, maybe take out the SIM and put it in your phone, then dig around your phone's About or Status menus to find where it shows the SIM's phone number?	somenewuser	t1_d9ktwjy
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9kv1rr	1478222271	There is a possibility that it is a New Zealand number, with 64 being the country code and 06 being a landline. Landline numbers are nine digits, the 0 is dropped when calling internationally.   +64 (0)6 161 XXXX  Might just be incorrect formatting of the number in question, assuming that number is automatically formatted by the iPhone	geeneepeegs	t1_d9kufuh
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9kv938	1478222547	Damn, if that's the case then I guess that's it  The phone didn't had any SIM card when I got it :(	lulzzfinder	t1_d9kuzyl
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9kvhpe	1478222866	Have you reverse searched the number on a website like whitepages.com?	Lynucs	t1_d9kufuh
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9kvlr9	1478223019	Yes  &gt;We did not find a match.  &gt;The given number is invalid.	lulzzfinder	t1_d9kvhpe
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9kw8s2	1478223870	Well, that sucks because that does mean the number is incorrect.  Hopefully one day you'll be near an Apple Store and they'll be able to return it no problem.	Lynucs	t1_d9kvlr9
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9kwoih	1478224471	One more thing.  Did you check "imei.info" website and put In the imei number to get the carriers info, this way we can tell if it's from a carrier in the U.S or another country.	Lynucs	t3_5az0pw
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9l9ho7	1478251207	Why not just send them a text? Or search the phone number with Facebook. If people have their number linked to their profile it will come up	ThaJohnDough	t3_5az0pw
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9ldi9j	1478262431	I ran the IMEI through iphoneimei.info and got this:   &gt;IMEI: 01342XXXXXXXXXX  &gt;Serial Number: XXXXXXXXXXXX  &gt;Find My iPhone: On  &gt;Telephone Technical Support: Expired  &gt;Repairs &amp; Service Coverage: Expired  &gt;Estimated Purchase Date: January 16, 2013  &gt;Contract: Expired  &gt;Country Purchased: United States	lulzzfinder	t1_d9kwoih
t3_5az0pw	t1_d9ldkd3	1478262550	I tried to send a text but didn't get any response, but also I don't know for sure if it got through.  I send it to +1 646 161 XXXX, don't know for sure if more numbers should be added when trying to reach it from another country  I also looked for it on Facebook before, but nothing came up	lulzzfinder	t1_d9l9ho7

t3_5b3ana	t1_d9lf4pv	1478265389	I've reluctantly switched to Narwhal and aside from relearning gestures it has quick switch night mode and tons of preview options.	Sandurz	t3_5b3ana

t3_5b3ana	t1_d9lhbl2	1478268722	There's probably an option that hides NSFW posts that you have checked. I don't use the official app, but this would make sense (since you don't want to accidentally click on that in public). Check the settings.	andysaurus_rex	t1_d9lfo3z
t3_5b3ana	t1_d9lhyi5	1478269605	Swiping to collapse a parent thread is so useful for me and one of the only reasons I'm  still using Alien Blue.	iQTester	t3_5b3ana

t3_5b3ana	t1_d9lkdjz	1478272719	Doesn't have casual subreddit adding. I have subs I want to read, but they'd take over my front page if I had them in my real subbed list.	wolfenkraft	t3_5b3ana
t3_5b3ana	t1_d9lkjut	1478272933	Can't Hide All at the end of a page. That's always been the killer feature for me. I hate seeing the same posts over and over.	hobenscoben	t3_5b3ana
t3_5b3ana	t1_d9lktz2	1478273269	Go to the subreddit list and type in whatever sub you want in the search box.	jackattacck	t1_d9lkdjz

t3_5b3ana	t1_d9ll6to	1478273688	I still haven't found a "Gallery" mode in the new client.   There are so many subs with pics, it's nice to be able to view *just* images.	BitingChaos	t3_5b3ana

t3_5b3ana	t1_d9lm5i8	1478274827	It's easier to tap than swipe further up on big phones.	jackattacck	t1_d9lm034
t3_5b3ana	t1_d9lmj5v	1478275271	You swipe anywhere in the comment thread and it collapses the entire thread. If you're past the top level comment you'd have to scroll up. So no it's not.	NikeSwish	t1_d9lm5i8
t3_5b3ana	t1_d9lq22g	1478279367	Not as convenient as AB's swipe but you can tap the 3 dots under any comment and select 'collapse thread' in the official app. No need to scroll back up to the parent.	Mattallica	t1_d9lmj5v
t3_5b3ana	t1_d9lq4p0	1478279452	You can create a multireddit of those subs and they'll act exactly like AB's custom groups. One downside though is you have to set them up on the desktop site first.	Mattallica	t1_d9lkdjz
t3_5b3ana	t1_d9lqy07	1478280389	Ah, I didn't realize it worked that way. In the official app. You can just press the next comment button and effectively do the same thing.	jackattacck	t1_d9lmj5v
t3_5b3ana	t1_d9lr1tj	1478280511	I think you can create a multi subreddit but I had already made the multi prior to installing narwhal	Taco_4_Life	t1_d9lq91i

t3_5b3ana	t1_d9mgic0	1478315453	Yeah. The name, the icon, and the capitalization keep me on Antenna.	kekspernikai	t1_d9ltfn3
t3_5b3ana	t1_d9mgjkn	1478315514	Eh, it's alright if you change the font, size, and use night mode.	kekspernikai	t1_d9ljf4s
t3_5b3ana	t1_d9mgzij	1478316279	Trust me, antenna (armc) is the best client out there. Go night mode and the GUI won't bother you as much. It seriously has everything and is the fastest out there	tha904mack	t1_d9lf4pv

t3_5c3khv	t1_d9ubuhl	1478787958	Basically PIN stands for personal identification number but in the US people usually say PIN Number, basically saying number twice. Same with Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) being referred to as an ATM Machine. English is weird.	retnuh730	t1_d9u9nc6
t3_5c3khv	t1_d9uoj0p	1478803438	I was pointing out that you have a trigger point on the capitalization spelling of an acronym, but many people misuse ATM Machine (ATM explicitly stands for Automated Teller Machine) and PIN Number (PIN = Personal Identification Number) and I wondered if that triggered you also.	sexuallyactivepope	t1_d9u9nc6

t3_5c9ytm	t1_d9vbpeb	1478833026	That's still not bad.  A 64GB iPad Air 2 for $249 is about what I paid for my 16GB iPad Mini 4.  A faster SoC, bigger screen and more storage could make that worth it.	InvaderDJ	t1_d9vbco8

t3_5ak1jm	t1_da0mpg3	1479172098	I am not on the iPhone Upgrade Program, but if I am correct that program is for the sim free iPhone.   I am still issue free and have tested it on several 30+ minute runs indoors and outside and have seen no issues.  I completed the update to iOS 10.2 b3 today and still issue free afterwards.	ghursh	t1_da0llwu
t3_5ak1jm	t1_da0nkh8	1479173319	That's good to know. Unfortunately the iPhone Upgrade Program does not give you the Sim Free version, it just gives you an unlocked version of carrier phone. I have a Genius Bar appt tomorrow to see what I can do. Hopefully they'll let me switch. This issue is infuriating.	Cirkuit	t1_da0mpg3
t3_5ak1jm	t1_da0oh1h	1479174554	I'd suggest going in early and talking to one of the sales managers and seeing if they would allow you to return the phone and purchase a sim free version. I was under the impression that phones under the upgrade program could be used on all networks making them basically sim free. I have not seen anyone with a CDMA version of the phone with the same problem that the GSM only phones have.	ghursh	t1_da0nkh8
t3_5ak1jm	t1_da2dzay	1479273383	No dice. I scheduled an appt and spoke with a manager. Due to the way financing works on the iPhone Upgrade Program, they can't swap the phone. So, I'm sh_t outta luck until Apple fixes the issue. It's still not fixed in 10.2 Beta 3, so who knows how long it'll take. I wish I would have kept my 6S Plus. This issue is so frustrating for someone who uses Bluetooth all day long. I may just have to get into the habit of turning off LTE when I don't need it.	Cirkuit	t1_da0oh1h

t3_5aicb0	t1_daa3nz6	1479765087	I just received this case today.  The iGlass Logo isn't that bad, the awful white lettering is 10x worse. I see a slight almost unnoticeable drop in reception. I haven't completed a scientific test but noticed that in places I always have 4 bars I had a mix of 4 and sometimes 3.  Conclusion: It is the best glass back, jet black, aluminum frame/bumper case available today. I think it offers decent value but would only use it without all the TEXT (again the logo is fine its just the text that is terrible). I used it all day but have since put my black leather OEM case back on. I plan to stay with this case.  The iGlass Logo isn't that bad, the awful white lettering is 10x worse.

t3_5e6u5a	t1_dab2ncv	1479830046	Grip all the way. The regular ones are just too slippy-slidey. I had the Candyshell Grip for my 6/6s, and the new Presidio Grips (played with one at Best Buy) are an excellent successor.	dskatter	t1_daah8cc
t3_5e6u5a	t1_dabctvh	1479842360	I actually tried to jump into a spec recently, and I was insanely disappointed.   I purchase a Presidio Grip for my 7 Plus. Loved it and ordered another one from Amazon.   Well within about 5 days, I noticed serious wearing on the rubber grips, so I messaged support about it, especially considering after i noticed the damage, my situation was confirmed by Amazon reviews.   Now I was a bit impatient after I got a form letter back from support that didn't address any real concerns, didn't address the appropriate warranty and just dismissed it saying there's a warranty and you can send it for replacement.   Problem is that by the time they replied, my other case that I bought was in use and showing the same damage.   I asked for the situation to be escalated because I had 2 cases with me showing the same damage and same wear in days, not even a month.   Support (thanks, Paul) wouldn't escalate, dismissed my issues and refused to do anything other than repeat that it could either be replaced through warranty or I could return it.   I was never able to get beyond the firewall created by Paul and I ended up returning both cases. The thought of having to go through the warranty to replaces cases on a monthly basis was not one that appealed to me, especially after being truly frustrated by what seems to be their only CS rep.   Bought a Caseology Paralax case for $14 and I'm insanely thrilled. It's not nearly as grippy and lovely in the hand, but at a fraction of the price I couldn't even complain. Other cases I bought in that same order were garbage. The Spigen Ultra Hybrid was nothing more than a hard to push button case with nothing special at all, and a very minor camera protection bump. The Ringke Air felt nice (it was super soft and grippy) but there was literally zero protection around the camera, and that's a deal killer for me.   I was tempted to buy the Candyshell Grip, but the weird port at the bottom for headphones (they used the same general mold, made the camera slot larger but left the headphone jack) and the shorter, 1 year warranty made me hesitate. Apparently the Candyshell Grip rubber is a better material, but if I had to deal with support again, I don't think I'd have been remotely happy.	andsoitgoes42	t1_daa6kxd

t3_5fcisz	t1_dajw3my	1480384000	My iPhone 5 purchased in July of 2013 fell into coffee late September of 2015. It immediately started vibrating, the screen was filled with lines and green artifacts, and was unresponsive to touch upon falling in the coffee.  I tried turning it off immediately as that's the best thing to do as soon as liquid contact occurs. It wouldn't respond, and eventually it just faded black and died... Dried it out, shook it out, did the best I could.  I threw it in rice overnight, and prematurely took it out the next morning, as the plan was to get a new phone that day. Tried to see if by some miracle it was fine. It wasn't, screen would come on but it was completely green with random grid lines. It would fade on, get really bright and really slowly fade back off.  So we go to Best Buy and pick up a brand new iPhone 6s. Later that day the iPhone 5 starts coming on like normal. The screen is still greenish and has lines, but it functions perfectly. Slowly over the next few days all the lines went away and the screen returned to normal color.  To this day, it is like new. Perhaps the vibration motor is slightly weaker and louder, but that might be placebo. I used this iPhone as my daily driver for a month. Works great, besides the fact that it's really old and slow now with iOS 10. Oh, how I wish we could downgrade iPhone 5 to iOS 6 just like iPhone 4s and iPad 2.	uncertain-ithink	t3_5fcisz
t3_5fcisz	t1_dajwctr	1480384311	Wow. What are this iPhone 5 made out of? Same thing happened to me with the touch being unresponsive when I took it out of the water. But that was clear water. Yours is coffee and that was worst.	vanduzled	t1_dajw3my

t3_5fcisz	t1_dajzecs	1480388218	My old phone was the blue 8gb model, and my new one is 64gb, space grey, so that speaks for itself.   It took me some time using Touch ID, even now, after a few weeks with the phone, I sometimes end up using passcode, just because it is a muscle memory.   Ios10 is super glitched. However I can now jailbreak my phone so I'll probs look into that.   I do notice 2 gigs of ram. It doesn't really revolutionise my phone now but it is definitely nice and notable. It does make gaming, browsing email and even searching the web a lot easier.   My day starts at 6:30am and I get home from school at about 4pm with upwards of 70-80%battery lef  with kinda heavy gaming(FIFA 16, clash royal, nova 3) email browsing and just google searching. No music or video playback.   The gui does feel smooth, it definitely doesn't freeze as much. On my old phone, pulling down spotlight search was a chore. I'm on mobile now so I'll update later when I get the chance.    PS, the iPhone se does have that same size as the 5	deadication1221	t1_dajw0p4

t3_5fgthj	t1_dakndj5	1480436272	I have used android exclusively until Thanksgiving Day. My device list has consisted of: Droid Incredible, Thunderbolt,  Galaxy S3, Galaxy Alpha, Note 2, Note 3, Galaxy S6 Active, Note 7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Note 7v2, LGk10 and now I have the iPhone 6. Let me preface this with all of my family and friends know me as an fandroid and I have caught nothing but flack for the switch from just about anyone that knows me.   After the Note 7 debacle, At&amp;t gave me (free) the K10 to use because there wasn't another android device I wanted to spend the money on. After using the LGk10 for a couple of weeks and hating life, I saw a good deal on a used iPhone 6 (64gb) for $300. I rationalized it as that was a great price and they hold their resell value. I figured I would give the iPhone a shot and if I didn't like it, I could get the S8 when it comes out and sell the iPhone 6 for what I paid for it.  I've only had the iPhone for a few days now but so far, I really like it. The screen resolution does leave something to be desired. It's not as crisp as the Note 7 and the blacks certainly aren't as black as the OLED display. I have found that real life performance (launching apps and cycling through them) isn't too different from each other. Some apps will reload on either platform and others stay in memory; this is impressive to me as the iPhone 6 has been out for 2 years and this comparison really isn't apples to apples. The iPhone 7 has a better display, processor, ram, camera than my 6.    iMessage is pretty fantastic and I like how photos sent in iMessage stay with the contact so you can find them at a later date rather easily. Read receipts and the typing notification is neat. If you have used facebook messenger, its the same deal, but in the regular text message app. At&amp;t RCS is getting there, but there are issues with it still and iMessage is lightyears ahead.  I miss my big display and SPen but you aren't getting the SPen experience anywhere outside of the Note series.   Battery life seems to be a bit better on the iPhone 6 than what would have been available in android when this phone was released in 2014.  I dont like that there isn't a dedicated back button on iPhone but I knew that when I got the phone. There are inconsistencies between apps which can be minorly frustrating. Sometimes the X or back button will be in the top left corner, others its in the top right. Given that most people are right handed, I dont understand why the X or back arrow isn't in the bottom right where it would be easily accessible for single-handed operation.   I used Sync for Reddit on android and I haven't found an iOS app for reddit that I am in love with as of yet. This is actually one of my biggest grips about the switch so far. I find that I dont really like reddit on iOS and has given me insight to why my friends with iPhone dont tend to care for reddit. It may just be the client they are using and not the site itself.   The fingerprint reader is fast. It probably out performs the Note 7 reader by a fraction of a second. A minor gripe is that if you have the fingerprint reader setup to unlock your phone, you cannot delay the lock. It locks immediately once you turn off the screen. You can delay the lock if you use a pin though. Not sure what the rationale was behind this but it is what it is.   Depending on how much customization you do on android will determine how bad you miss it. I used tasker and set up profiles to automate things such as turning my phone on vibrate when I get to work or launch Google Play Music when my Note 7 connects to my car bluetooth. It doesn't appear that I can do any of those things on iPhone but are minor inconveniences. One thing I always hated on Samsung devices was the high volume warning notification. Every time I would turn up the volume on my phone in the car, it would stop short of max and warn me that loud music was bad. With iOS, I have to move over to the lock screen widget and launch my music app there. These are just minor differences really. Another demerit on iOS is the ability to set default apps. When I ask Siri to navigate somewhere, I want it to use Google Maps but it opens Apple Maps.   I thought the switch was going to be more dramatic to be honest. iOS seems to be polished better, less app stutter and redrawing. It keeps your place in apps better (when you close them) than android in my short time with the device so far.   All in all, I am impressed. iMessage, facetime and resell value are iOS's strongest features in my opinion. A cell phone's primary function is a communication device and I was having trouble sending picture texts so I had to look elsewhere. I was hoping Allo was going to be the answer to my prayers, but apparently, iMessage was.   I will likely keep this phone and wait to see what Samsung does with the Note 8 and SMS/MMS messaging. If there aren't any changes with SMS/MMS, I will likely stick with Apple moving forward for the solid ecosystem, support, longevity and better 3rd party support. Samsung really dropped the ball on the Note 7. Had they given me the option to buy the S7(E) with the ability to upgrade to the Note 8 when it comes out (plus the price difference), I would have an S7 right now and they would have kept me as a customer. Given my experience with Apple so far, I'm glad they didn't.	Whit3W0lf	t3_5fgthj

t3_4nt4nc	t1_damn3tg	1480541565	Gamepad has been holding up great!  Quality is outstanding.    As far as emulators, check out Provenance.  You don't need jailbreak, just either:    1) a developer account and a Mac to build and install, or    2) a builds.io subscription to install from there  I've used both methods and can vouch for them.  Good luck!	croaky_elvis	t1_damhos9
t3_4nt4nc	t1_damo35w	1480542653	Awesome dude. Thanks for getting back to me. Just a few more questions if you don't mind.   I read somewhere that playing with a gamepad on iOS for emulator use is quite laggy. Do you find this with the gamevice?  Have you tried the gamepad with the moonlight app? If so, how well does it work?  Is the gamevice comfortable to use?   Thanks again.	Smittywerbenjensen	t1_damn3tg

t3_4nt4nc	t1_damt3d0	1480548644	Emulation using the GameVice is the smoothest that I've experienced.  Having the lightning connector makes all the difference - I've tried using Bluetooth gamepads in the past and can attest to the laggy experience that you mentioned.  Response time with the GameVice is almost perfect, and it's especially noticeable in platformers like Super Mario World.  I have not used the Moonlight app.  I don't have a PC capable of game streaming. If only this worked with Xbox streaming!  I'm still holding out hope that Microsoft is working on this.  GameVice is actually quite comfortable on the iPad Air 2.  Having the left and right side controls so far apart feels different at first, but it's more comfortable on the wrists.	croaky_elvis	t1_damo35w

t3_4nt4nc	t1_damubh9	1480550251	Thanks. You've sold me on the gamevice. Xbox streaming would be sweet on the iPad.

t3_5funwh	t1_dan8g5x	1480569988	No that was true with the old battery tech but lithium, the kind all modern phone uses doesn't care when you charge it.	badbits	t3_5funwh
t3_5funwh	t1_dan8kk4	1480570201	Modern phones don't have the kinds of limitations and issues that older phones did. The batteries and the charging circuits are extremely advanced.   You do not have to drain the phone down to zero. That accomplishes nothing. Charge it up as often as you like, or use it all up by the end of the day, doesn't matter.   And phones are designed to be plugged in overnight, they know that's what you'll do.   If anyone tells you that you need to do something special to make your battery last longer or work better, ignore them, they're working from outdated information.   The only exception is extreme heat, that's bad for your phone and your battery. Such as letting it charge in a hot car or in direct sunlight (in the summer) where the phone can overheat.	AthleticNerd_	t3_5funwh
t3_5funwh	t1_dan9amm	1480571525	Actually, letting it die is worse for the battery. You only want to do that if you are calibrating the battery, and you are supposed to plug it in right after it dies.   Suggested charging is plugging in above 20%. But letting it dip below this won't hurt it too much.   Leaving it plugged in overnight should be fine. Your phone will stop charging when full.	IsaoraAK	t3_5funwh

t3_5funwh	t1_danc4y7	1480577756	This! Thank you. Also physical damage can hurt your battery (eg dropping it) so get a good case!! Also closing apps when ur not using them can also hurt ur battery as apps running in the background really don't use battery as ram is constant but having to use the processing power to reopen them will use considerable amounts of battery.   Also never download those "battery saving apps" they traditionally use WAY more battery than they'll ever save. Your phone power saving options are by far the best!! You can also turn off apps running in the background to save battery as some constantly use location services and like to upload that sweet sweet metadata.   Enjoy your phone, take care of it and don't be afraid to play around with it you won't hurt it :D   Source: previous Samsung sales specialist	nate8quake	t1_dan8kk4
t3_5funwh	t1_dandudt	1480582510	Leaving it unplugged overnight is fine. Usually try to keep the phone in 20-80 % range.

t3_5fy6zo	t1_danxdf3	1480617172	Infuse is still one of the best video player out there with many features and can practically play any format, but it's a little pricey.  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/infuse-pro-5/id1136220915?mt=8	THX---1138	t3_5fy6zo
t3_5fy6zo	t1_dao0n3y	1480620911	I checked the reviews and there seems to be some "controversy" going on with the whole upgrade from infuse 4 to 5. I'm on the same boat as the OP and been looking at infuse and nplayer. If you know what's going on with infuse, could you explain it to me before i drop some cash on it?	Drollest	t1_danxdf3
t3_5fy6zo	t1_dao18s0	1480621591	Users of 4 (including myself) are a little pissed that we have to pay full price for 5.... it's a little bit of a dick move on the developers, but I myself, haven't seen any major improvements/additions on version 5 to make me want to upgrade.	THX---1138	t1_dao0n3y
t3_5fy6zo	t1_dao1b4l	1480621665	The "controversy" was derailed after a day or so when Infuse cut the update costs by 30% (upgrade before 11 Dec) and grandfathered in free updates for everyone buying Infuse 4 after 1 August.. [More on that here](https://firecore.com/forum/topic/17602) but that's eminently fair and decent, especially for a small company with basically one product, trying to make it in the world. Anyone who thinks it should be cheaper doesn't deserve good software (IMHO..)  By the way, did I mention that buying Infuse on the iPhone gives you an iPad and AppleTV version too? I run all my movies and TV shows through the aTV app onto my big TV and it's smooth as butter -- plus, all the Dolby channels decode perfectly!	HollandJim	t1_dao0n3y
t3_5fy6zo	t1_dao1en7	1480621772	Unfortunately HBO now and Amazon video is us only :(. I hear people say good things about it. I tried Netflixs trial but dam man. Compared to the US. Australia has a shit ass library.	SpendingChickens	t1_danx6gx
t3_5funwh	t1_dao1xsv	1480622367	This is not true. It was an issue with NiMH batteries, but not with modern Li-ion and modern charging circuits.   But, nobody lets their phone go to zero and die every day anyway.	AthleticNerd_	t1_danzalt
t3_5fy6zo	t1_dao1zq4	1480622427	Oh it was infuse 4 app. I noticed it had a really low rating and checked it out since it might affect my decision on infuse 5.   Btw I've been looking into video players for a good day and the general consensus is that nplayer and infuse are the best apps. You have to play for them but they can play everything. Now i'm just trying to pick which one is for me	Drollest	t1_dao1he8
t3_5fy6zo	t1_dao272o	1480622663	Oh that's awesome to hear. Didn't know I would get the iPad and appleTV version as well. Also I don't have a problem with the price since I agree that you pay for quality. Just wanted to know what's going on since I'm thinking of buying nplayer or infuse right now. Trying to decide which one is better though	Drollest	t1_dao1b4l
t3_5fy6zo	t1_dao27xq	1480622690	Ohh I see. Ill probably check them out as well. That's what I was going to ask but then I got curious and made it into one thread. I'm trying to find a video player as well but most of them can't play x256(?) mkv files. I don't want to drop out $20 just for it not to work. Most of my friends recommended VLC but I've yet to try it.	SpendingChickens	t1_dao1zq4
t3_5fy6zo	t1_dao2ftg	1480622940	Having used both, AND having pissed about with a Plex server (never again..) let me vote for Infuse all the way.	HollandJim	t1_dao272o
t3_5fy6zo	t1_dao2i67	1480623012	Whoa what are you watching that are x256 mkv files. Unless I haven't been keeping up, those kinds of files are still pretty uncommon	Drollest	t1_dao27xq
t3_5fy6zo	t1_dao2q7m	1480623267	Thanks for the input. I haven't found a lot of people who have tried both and your "random stranger on the internet" opinion actually really helps me out :)  Btw sorry for all the questions, but can you explain whats the difference between the standalone and subscription thing Infuse is doing? And in your opinion which is the better deal?	Drollest	t1_dao2ftg
t3_5funwh	t1_dao3cvg	1480623977	How often does anyone let their phone go to zero and die? Not often. So don't worry about it. If you make a statement like 'letting your phone go to zero is bad for the battery' then people get paranoid and unnecessarily worry about their battery when they don't not need to.	AthleticNerd_	t1_dao2pp6
t3_5fyxiz	t1_dao3jcc	1480624182	Yes. I used the leather case with a screen protector on my 6+ and 6s+ and wanted something different so I have a plastic unequal case from bodyguardz. But thinking about getting another leather one from Apple.	Cien_fuegos	t3_5fyxiz
t3_5fyxiz	t1_dao3oc4	1480624341	were two of the same while I don't usually use them every so often I switch things up, I have about 6-8 cases I use to switch up the style of my phone.	calabree	t1_dao3jcc

t3_5fyxiz	t1_dao4ah3	1480625042	Yeah on my 5s I had 3-5 cases for it. I liked switching out I just liked the leather so much that I kept it for a while	Cien_fuegos	t1_dao3oc4
t3_5fy6zo	t1_dao52f8	1480625911	My friend said I should really watch this animation show called "One Punch Man" and I asked him what it was and he explained and said "Dw here's a USB with it here.".

t3_5fyxiz	t1_dao5lxg	1480626542	With most of my phones. I HATE using cases. Why buy a beautiful phone then slap an ugly ass plastic case over it? iPhone 4/4S, Note 3/7. Then I got an iPhone 7+ Jet Black and I realised I needed a case.	SpendingChickens	t3_5fyxiz

t3_5fyxiz	t1_dao8t8t	1480630313	Yes I usually have multiple cases for the phone I have, but usually wear a clear one so I can still see the phone.	Mintergirl42	t3_5fyxiz
t3_5fyxiz	t1_daoa7r1	1480632050	yes, I don't want to use one but I feel like it would scratch in an instance if I accidently put it in my pocket with my keys.	postit31	t3_5fyxiz
t3_5fy6zo	t1_daob6j6	1480633259	Are you talking about movies/shows you already have on a hard drive? If so, Plex is the best.	pickleballiodine	t3_5fy6zo

t3_5fyxiz	t1_daoc5yd	1480634530	I'm sort of the opposite, I've always used a case but I got a jet black and decided not to use one. Why get a jet black if I can't see it? If I had gotten any other color I would most likely have a case on it.	Chip_Smith	t1_dao5lxg
t3_5fyxiz	t1_daocbq9	1480634739	Hate using cases especially on the 6s that's exactly why my phone screen cracked rn .	itzfry	t3_5fyxiz
t3_5fy6zo	t1_daofm29	1480641194	Wanna support the devs, so they can eat more than just once and never after that, take the subscription, it's less than half a $ per month and they'll have regular incomes.   Wanna pay once and for all and not pay a yearly fee, get the Pro version, they're exactly the same.   Also if you choose the Pro version, look the difference between the version 4 and 5. If nothing added in version 5 appeals you you could save a few $	M3kh4l	t1_dao2q7m
t3_5fyxiz	t1_daofrnl	1480641401	I'm using a black apple silicone case. Ordered the storm gray leather case. I feel that these cases don't add very much bulk and give it a little grip. The phone by itself felt really slick. Also these cases will add a little drop protection.	Rendawg90	t3_5fyxiz
t3_5fy6zo	t1_daofxma	1480641622	Hmmm, x265 MKV....  it depends, my gf iPad mini 4 had some trouble with them on Infuse (occasional freezes).  My iPhone 6s on the other hand had no problem (no freezes nor dropping frame rate) streaming x265 videos. It only got really warm.	M3kh4l	t1_dao27xq

t3_5fyxiz	t1_daoh87x	1480643304	I only use a case for grip. These metal phones slide right out of my hand otherwise.	teslaboner	t3_5fyxiz
t3_5fyxiz	t1_daonrza	1480651858	Nope, a huge part of the reason that Apple phones are expensive is the premium build quality / aesthetics. Why would I hide that inside a cheap piece of plastic?	i91809	t3_5fyxiz
t3_5fy6zo	t1_daorz0c	1480658232	True, but 4 will go one day (probably a year or two).   I took the subscription myself; I can stop it at any time if I see no utility in continuing, but small companies that do cool, special things need to survive, and they need to eat and have lives. "The world must be peopled!" Ergo, subscribed.	HollandJim	t1_daofm29
t3_5fyxiz	t1_daotn6q	1480661402	My thoughts exactly. The Jet black feels like it gets dented easier then the rest the models.	Mrpornogoregrinder	t1_dao5lxg
t3_5g1ze0	t1_daouj9y	1480663210	I had my iPhone 5's battery replaced, the process took me just ~15-20 min and my phone came back perfect!  No sign whatsoever on the phone that it was opened and I loved how the new battery preformed, they give you a three month warranty on it too.  I wouldn't hesitate to replace it if I were you, good luck!	j6121	t3_5g1ze0
t3_5g1ze0	t1_daovszh	1480666379	I too am looking at this. I think I'll take up the offer for it. A new battery is always good. Had it for over a year, no sign of degradation but still in the long run it will be worth it	IshDanish	t3_5g1ze0
t3_5g1ze0	t1_daox07w	1480669832	Took nearly an hour here in Amsterdam but it too came back perfect.  Let me rephrase your question: Would I do it if it meant a new battery and a 3 month warranty for a 1 hour wait? Um, duh.  ;)	HollandJim	t1_daouj9y
t3_5bwaie	t1_daoxq7l	1480672078	I have the same problem. I deleted the TV by mistake and now I don't know how to get it back.

t3_5g1ze0	t1_daoztt5	1480678816	I went into the Apple Store the other day to have the replacement done, but instead of replacing battery I was given a new phone. It was a super simple process, just make sure to backup your data.	winning_by_default	t3_5g1ze0
t3_5g2tbw	t1_dap03j9	1480679609	Just ask politely, it wasn't your fault. I think they would give you another one  Unless you storm in rude and shout "WTF Apple, I paid for this, now swap me a phone now, and compensation please."	pw5a29	t3_5g2tbw
t3_5g2tbw	t1_dap0ap6	1480680173	Take it back. They will run their tests and whatnot and more than likely give you a new one.	tensai_76	t3_5g2tbw
t3_5g2tbw	t1_dap0do2	1480680397	Yup. Their diagnostic test even specifically checks for Touch ID failure. 🙌🏽	alexwoww	t1_dap0ap6

t3_5g3azw	t1_dap39fg	1480686532	Yes, that's a huge step down. The 6s Plus (instead of the 6 Plus you're considering) would probably be fine overall, but I can't recommend getting a two year old phone with less than great performance.  Edit: clarity	greatcaffeine	t3_5g3azw
t3_5g3azw	t1_dap3lvp	1480687108	The 6s series is just a little over a year old	cyman83	t1_dap39fg
t3_5g3azw	t1_dap3nau	1480687175	I agree. A 6s Plus would be fine, especially since it has 3D touch, a significantly better camera, and an additional GB of RAM.	Joshua_P	t1_dap39fg
t3_5g3azw	t1_dap3nk1	1480687187	Correct, but OP is talking about a 6 Plus, not a 6s Plus. I'll edit my comment for clarity.	greatcaffeine	t1_dap3lvp

t3_5g2tbw	t1_dap66h6	1480690912	This is interesting. I've had my iPhone 7 for 2 months now and the past 2 weeks I've had problems with Touch ID. It will just not work at all. It's most frustrating when I want to download an app and it asks for Touch ID and it doesn't even tell me 'Try Again' it just does nothing.	hiswoman	t3_5g2tbw

t3_5g2tbw	t1_dap6jhr	1480691396	I don't know what did it, but it suddenly started working again. I did reset to factory default and then put my backup on it (it was still broken).   Somehow, after a few minutes it started working again..? I'm still kind of worried it will happen again, but it works for now.  Mine did the same as yours: it didn't light up the circles on the lock screen (that light up individually when you put in your passcode or all light up when finger is recognized), it didn't give me an error at all. It just did nothing. Pressing the button worked, however.	i-Flames	t1_dap66h6

I have a Galaxy Note 4 here with a Spiegen Screen protector. I've had the protector on it ever since the Note 4 came out. So that's about October 2014. As you can see, it still looks amazing.  http://i.imgur.com/OhE59xV.jpg  Been using one on my iPhone 7 since I got it as well. Looks fantastic and ultimately feels fantastic as well. Good protection, good feeling. Worth it in my opinion.  And while you weren't asking, this is the case I use for the phone. It goes nicely.

t3_5ft530	t1_daqhp8u	1480772676	Seriously dude, this video was fucking beautiful! Very inspiring.	12techno12	t3_5ft530
t3_5g7mla	t1_daqjhln	1480776489	Nope, I just use the Apple silicon case and the bumper before that. No scratching. Also, re the glass ones, I read this in another thread do don't know if it's accurate but: people often give credit to the shield saving their screen because the shield breaks when the phone is dropped but the screen's ok. Someone pointed out that the shield isn't as shatter proof so even though it broke the screen likely would have been ok anyway.	Ezl	t3_5g7mla
t3_5g8usf	t1_daqk0tp	1480777529	yep same! that's another thing that added to the 7's bulk for me - felt it was more of a necessity to have a case because of the camera bump.  the SE is a severely underrated handset. I only dread that its next incarnation will lose the headphone jack and physical home button :(	mattlol	t1_daqfgid
t3_5g8usf	t1_daql8ob	1480779753	If you like the size of the phone you have now get the se. The iPhone SE has a better processor and camera than the iPhone 6 anyway	zeft64	t3_5g8usf
t3_5g8usf	t1_daqlali	1480779847	I agree man get the iPhone se. The battery life and performance are great and you'd get better performance than the iPhone 6s anyway	zeft64	t1_daqdq7s
t3_5g7mla	t1_daqnztm	1480784177	I prefer these edge to edge screen protectors because they look better. This one was recommended on this subreddit and it works with the Apple silicone and leather cases! I bought one and I love it. https://www.amazon.com/Protector-TURATA-Tempered-Ultra-Thin-Hardness/dp/B01KXP4F70/  I debated whether it was necessary to get a protector at all for a long time. Now that I have one, I highly recommend it.	TheSaharaPalace	t3_5g7mla
t3_5g8usf	t1_daqprr8	1480786806	Yeah thanks for this! Might save up a little bit for the 6S. My 5S is still working fine so maybe it can wait.	kurukiddo	t1_daqe4cc

t3_5gap93	t1_daqs007	1480790058	Ya. But you have to have a jail broken iPhone. And they have to be connected to the same wifi network.   Note: haven't done this since ios8 so not totally positive.	thebabybananagrabber	t3_5gap93
t3_5gap93	t1_daqss6f	1480791190	I have seen searching for a way to do this without jailbreak as well	im_the_princess	t3_5gap93
t3_5gap93	t1_daqsyp4	1480791455	Welcome to the Apple ecosystem. It's built into MacOS. I don't see why Apple would have the desire to do this for a competing product.	nofork77	t3_5gap93
t3_5gap93	t1_daqt0ls	1480791534	Nope. The jailbreak involves forwarding your messages to a 3rd party system which is a gigantic security issue so you'd be crazy to do that.	tsdguy	t3_5gap93
t3_5gap93	t1_daqxg4p	1480797930	Use VMWare to run a virtual MacOS install within Windows? You'd need to pay for...or otherwise obtain...the MacOS software.	sohanley	t3_5gap93
t3_5gap93	t1_daqxxgn	1480798648	Unfortunately, no. It would be a welcome addition, but Apple is highly unlikely to offer iMessage on Windows/Linux platform. Blackberry pulled the same stunt with BBM while they were at the top, only to make it available cross platform once they're dead. I've love to have iMessage all over my machines, as I use Windows laptops, desktops, as well as iPhone, iPad Pro, Mini, MBPs, and iMacs.  It would be great, but I don't see it happening any time soon.	Tackticat	t3_5gap93
t3_5gap93	t1_dar39u4	1480806560	Unless something has changed this doesn't work. Something about apple caching hardware profiles on valid devices and virtual machines don't register properly.	TomcatsRevenge	t1_daqxg4p
t3_5gap93	t1_dar6m3s	1480811611	Because there's way more people using windows that you can sell iPhones to. Although seeing the inventory issues the plus has had, maybe it's a good thing they don't try to broaden their customer base.	a_park_bench	t1_daqsyp4

t3_5gap93	t1_darq8hr	1480852239	It'd still be a violation of the macOS license agreement.	dakboy	t1_daqxg4p
t3_5gap93	t1_darz0l3	1480871062	True, but that doesn't mean Apple will see it that way.  Don't get me wrong, I would love to see it too, but I am realistic about it.	nofork77	t1_dar6m3s
t3_5gap93	t1_das09fi	1480872745	It's the difference between say Apple who doesn't seem willing to make an iMessage program for windows vs Microsoft who makes sure their office suite is available and updated on Mac. Hardware company vs software company. It seems that Apple doesn't see the increased sales of people looking for iMessage on windows as worth it compared to the time and money it would cost to build the program.   I suppose it could also be due to apples well-known insistence on their "walled garden".	a_park_bench	t1_darz0l3
t3_5gap93	t1_das2653	1480875126	Well, it's not like MS gives Mac Office away for free. Would you pay for iMessage on Windows?  I would argue that Microsoft is also a hardware supplier what with that little thing called the XBOX. I might add that one of their top pieces of software on that platform is Halo and Bungie was originally making the game for Mac...	nofork77	t1_das09fi
t3_5g8usf	t1_das93gs	1480883426	the iPhone 6s was released in September 2015 lol and it's not "old" but it'll be a generation behind because by next year the iPhone 7s (or 8) will be out	Cydelyoung	t1_darojpa
t3_5gap93	t1_dasbsiz	1480886677	Apple also makes software, but they make most of their money on hardware. Microsoft makes most of their money on software. I didn't say they were software or hardware suppliers, I said hardware or software companies.   Would I personally pay? Maybe, maybe not. I don't necessarily need iMessage on windows myself. It'd be neat but not something I'm clamoring for. But there should at least be the option. As for whether it should even cost money, what Microsoft hardware are you buying to use their software on a Mac?	a_park_bench	t1_das2653
t3_5g8usf	t1_dasc0xf	1480886987	No shit /s   I know this. Ive assumed that "new" 6s with new storage that was released this year will be worth more next year than older 6s	alus992	t1_das93gs

t3_5gilz6	t1_dasku8h	1480898532	they also dropped the LAN too.... I"m so stupid to stick with the older macbook pro that year..... the CD drive wasn't used for more than 5 times in 4 years	pw5a29	t1_dasizgw
t3_5gilz6	t1_daslyc3	1480900102	I doubt they will go back to the headphone jack. It would be like admitting they were wrong. Don't let that be your deciding factor though. It's mostly a minor annoyance.	Backtothelabagain	t3_5gilz6
t3_5gihuy	t1_dasn5im	1480901721	Thanks for the reply.  Do you mean the one above the speaker at the top of the phone?  My case isn't covering that so I'm baffled?  My iPhone isn't white, so not sure if there is something else I haven't seen.  When I remove the case it works though, so it's presumably somewhere else other than above the speaker?	totallytrue	t1_dashyg1

t3_5gihuy	t1_daspbxs	1480904630	Thanks for replying.  I've taken the case off and believe I can see a sensor on the right of the hole above the speaker, not the left.  And when I specifically cover that sensor it affects the auto brightness, so the case appears to be cut on the wrong side I think.	totallytrue	t1_daso5p3
t3_5gilz6	t1_dasssmm	1480909254	No one cares the headphone jack is gone right now but they will when battery life sucks and they can't make it more than 8 hours before their phone dies. Dongles though.	nipplekick	t3_5gilz6

t3_5gloqk	t1_dat9e7h	1480947379	What? Rice works like those little packages that they include with shoes that prevent them from getting destroyed by humidity.	Cyberbeni	t1_dat6s13
t3_5gloqk	t1_datcwfu	1480952650	First of all, turn it off. Then you need to get the moisture out of the phone as soon as possible, it will damage components if it staysin too long. So heating it in an oven  (max 40°C) or using a hairdryer are the quickest options. Rice won't do a lot except it absorbs the moisture coming out of your phone. And that can take a lot of time, time you don't have as various parts will be affected by the moisture.	v8xd	t3_5gloqk
t3_5gloqk	t1_datd09h	1480952790	I don't recommend an oven or hair dryer. I used to repair phones for a living and I've seen people destroy their phones doing this even lightly.	Tbhjr	t1_datcwfu
t3_5gloqk	t1_datd7pq	1480953064	If you have access to a  food dehydrator, power the phone off and put it in there for about 10-15 minutes. Rice can help a little just to absorb moisture but it doesn't always work. Corrosion and rust on the inside may occur but if it was just 2 seconds in water, it may be very light. Don't use heat sources like heat guns, hair dryers, ovens, or anything of the sort. You can easily fry components doing so. I've worked on plenty of water-damaged phones and I've seen some with the LCD and battery flex connectors corroded but still work normally. And it also depends on what was in the water.	Tbhjr	t3_5gloqk
t3_5gloqk	t1_datddm4	1480953276	Not sure why you're being downvoted, putting a [waterlogged device in rice is essentially an urban myth at this point.](http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/14/9326035/can-rice-actually-save-your-wet-phone)  &gt;"Of the seven household desiccants they tested, uncooked rice was the least absorbent, behind cat litter, couscous, oatmeal, and instant rice."	gulabjamunyaar	t1_dat6s13

t3_5gnr0s	t1_datv3w6	1480973867	I had the 7 . I came from the galaxy s7 that's why I was not really satisfied  with the 4,7. I wanted a bigger screen for reddit,YouTube and so on.    Went out and looked at the plus (when I had the galaxy s7 I never wanted a s7 edge because it felt too big). Played half an hour with the plus (in the store) because I was not sure if I should buy it or not. I said f... It and bought it. Went home put all on the plus. I was happy.    First day with the plus I was happy but something was not perfect many times a day I was thinking it's too big. Came home and took the 7 in the hand and it felt "better" in the hand.   After 24 hours I started to regret the move to the plus. I didn't know what to do. Should I keep or bring it back and keep the 7. I kept using it for couple more days and decide after that. Now I will never go back to the 7 or a smaller phone. Just a couple of days and I was so used to the bigger phone and will not go back. My mother is also happy because she got my 7, so everyone is happy now :) :)    tldr: went from the 7 to the 7 plus. Took me some time to get used.

t3_5gnr0s	t1_daty0vr	1480977292	I actually do.  I've had a 6+ for a little over a year and I initially loved it because of the extra battery life and screen size (I'm 40 so eyesight's not perfect anymore)....BUT I'm tired of not really being able to keep it in my pocket, especially when sitting down. I'm a guy and wear snug (but not skinny) jeans most of the time, and it's just too big to live in my front pocket. I always have to take it out when I sit down.  When I replace it, I'll go with a 7, maybe even an SE. I don't think I'll miss the size, but I will definitely miss the battery life. And I'm a little sad about the optical zoom camera.	simplecocktails	t3_5gnr0s

t3_5guhw9	t1_dav8qea	1481053516	My paint bubbled and then flaked off a little. Paint shouldn't flake or wear on an £830 iPhone after just a few weeks!   http://i.imgur.com/slVhubr.jpg   I'm confident apple will replace mine and I'll stick my neck out and say they will replace your wife's too. At least here in the UK consumer rights are very strong. You do not expect the paint on a VERY expensive phone to chip or wear off after a few months of normal use.   I'll be asking for another colour.	walgman	t3_5guhw9

t3_5gvbso	t1_davd1b4	1481058441	From what I just heard a coworker complaining about, he says he had to make an appointment to go to the Apple Store.  Once there they took down some information to order a battery that will be there in ~3 days.  Then he has to schedule another appointment to drop the phone off and they will replace the battery.	Internexus	t3_5gvbso
t3_5gvbso	t1_davd6pn	1481058610	Are you kidding? When I went through the sign up process I was only shown times when they could do the whole process. I really hope I can be in and out in a single appointment...	triplec787	t1_davd1b4
t3_5guhw9	t1_davd6wf	1481058616	I will. Another redditor experienced the same issue and they replaced theirs. Consumer rights act is heavily weighted in the consumers favour. You do not expect premium goods to shed paint under normal use.  https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/5avgpn/matt_black_iphone_7_peeling/?	walgman	t1_dav9qqb
t3_5gvbso	t1_davdgze	1481058932	My coworker was quite livid about the whole situation.  I cannot say with certainty if this is how it's being done at all Apple stores, or if it's different based on sizes of cities etc...	Internexus	t1_davd6pn
t3_5gvbso	t1_davdnv1	1481059150	When did he have it done? I'm hoping after all this time they may have figured their shit out.	triplec787	t1_davdgze
t3_5gvbso	t1_daveewm	1481060007	Oh jeez ok lol I was hoping it was a little more time. Oh well wish me luck I guess.	triplec787	t1_davdr8l
t3_5gvbso	t1_davfb12	1481061021	As someone who was working for Apple during this situation, I don't get how he was mad regarding the recall.   If they didn't recall, he'd still be stuck with a phone that turns off and on.	OptionalCookie	t1_davdgze
t3_5guhw9	t1_davfyiq	1481061779	Yea.. that's normal.  In fact, when Apple replaced my iPhone 6, the one they gave me had significant wear.	OptionalCookie	t3_5guhw9

t3_5gvbso	t1_davhoxa	1481063929	For me, once they had the battery in all I had to do was drop my phone off and I came back about 90 minutes later and it was done. All my data was intact, no wipes or anything.	Flux85	t3_5gvbso
t3_5gvbso	t1_davhrc8	1481064014	Ok. Would you recommend calling ahead and seeing if they have the battery in stock?	triplec787	t1_davhoxa
t3_5gvbso	t1_davhyfi	1481064260	It wouldn't hurt to try, I originally made an appointment to start the whole process and they look at your phone, have you disable "Find my iPhone" to verify ownership as well as to be able to log it in their system for repair. I was then told I had to come back since their batteries were on backorder and that they'd call/email me when it was in. (I got both an email and a call from my local Apple Store)	Flux85	t1_davhrc8
t3_5guhw9	t1_davjlvu	1481066421	i had the same issue with mine i told my co worker about it and he brought it to my attention that when you put your phone down on the desk sometimes you let it slide a bit which is why it is doing that	puff_danny13	t3_5guhw9
t3_5gvbso	t1_davmw2l	1481070855	This happened to my sister, but worse. They would only hold the battery for 1 week but they didn't have any appointment slots, so she is stuck in an impossible limbo right now.	con247	t1_davd6pn
t3_5gvbso	t1_davupkp	1481081590	I didn't even know this was a problem until I was in the middle of flying my Mavic today and my phone died mid flight, it was at about 60%.  I googled the issue and found out about the replacement program, and my serial number was indeed part of the program.  I don't have an Apple store near me but I do have Apple Care Plus, so they allowed me to do an express replacement.  They put a hold on my card for a ridiculous amount of money and they are supposed to ship me a new one.  I have to ship the old one back, and the hold on my card should be released at that time.	Araya213	t3_5gvbso
t3_5gvbso	t1_dawacl1	1481118520	I had my appointment last night and after I got there they ran diagnostics on my battery and told me they had to order the replacement. They said it would be in within 3-5 days then when I come in next it would take an hour and a half to two hours to replace the battery. They also sent an e-mail with the service details.  &gt; **Problem Description/Diagnosis**  &gt; Issue: Customer states phone will shut off at random times.  &gt; Steps to Reproduce: Battery diagnostics. Errorr with data  &gt; Cosmetic Condition: No physical damage  &gt; Proposed Resolution: Propose a battery replacement under quality program. Customer has back up and aware of data loss.

t3_5h0dha	t1_dawn7is	1481134936	I don't know about electronics, but I've read of a number of US companies moving production back from China because it turned out to be cheaper and better in the long run. Of course, they don't employ anywhere near as many people in America as they did in China, because it's cheaper to automate there.  And I have a hard time believing that labour costs add that much to the price of an iPhone, anyway. It's more likely to be the other costs of operating in America, like regulation and taxes. Trump is in a position to do something about both of those.	edmg	t1_dawhqy1
t3_5h101x	t1_dawn7tw	1481134946	Fuck I paid 725$ Canadian for it and £350 is about 584$ canadian ... I thought Apple kept their value longer than that. I guess I'll have to keep it for a year at least to get my money's worth.	LeCroqueMitaine	t1_dawn2eo
t3_5h101x	t1_dawnsx4	1481135615	Shit man, that's rough. I generally hear stories about Canadian and Aussie stuff being expensive from Apple. How come you're selling so quick anyway?	BinThereRedThat	t1_dawn7tw
t3_5h0dha	t1_dawoho9	1481136382	&gt; they don't employ anywhere near as many people in America as they did in China  And there's the issue with this part of "MAGA".  The jobs aren't going to be as plentiful as they are in China, despite what we're told.  &gt; And I have a hard time believing that labour costs add that much to the price of an iPhone, anyway. It's more likely to be the other costs of operating in America, like regulation and taxes.  Issue being, when you have to pay every worker a minimum of $7.25 in the US vs. the estimated $2.50 an hour they pay now in China, labor costs skyrocket.  Additionally, those taxes and regulatory fees benefit the municipalities and states where the factories are located.  Take those away and you put a strain on fire, police and public works departments that must serve these new factories.	CaptNemo131	t1_dawn7is
t3_5h101x	t1_dawoutj	1481136789	They do keep their value, but brand new from store price will always be a fair bit higher than "like new".   With that said, some persons are willing to pay extra for a phone that's 1 month old vs one that's 1 year old even if both have the same physical condition. If you list it highlight the age and show proof of age.	calyp5e	t1_dawn7tw
t3_5h0dha	t1_dawpd8a	1481137359	&gt; Issue being, when you have to pay every worker a minimum of $7.25 in the US vs. the estimated $2.50 an hour they pay now in China, labor costs skyrocket.  How many hours do you think those people are taking to assemble a $600 phone? They're not soldering the chips in by hand, one leg at a time. They're doing the things that are cheaper to pay someone a few dollars an hour to do than to automate (and some of those will still cost a lot more to automate than paying an American to do them).  Edit: and, taking a longer-term view, companies that figure out how to automate those jobs away will open new markets that won't happen while you can hire Chinese people to do them for next to nothing. The supply of cheap Chinese workers is reducing manufacturing innovation, just as the Romans might have started the Industrial Revolution a thousand years earlier if they didn't have a ready supply of slaves.	edmg	t1_dawoho9

t3_5h0dha	t1_dawpkq4	1481137593	Exactly.  And then they bring the factories to the US, where if they're mostly automated, we won't have the jobs Trump thinks he's bringing back.  Additionally, Foxconn workers work a large amount of overtime to complete the orders for Apple.  Automation may solve this too, but there won't be any additional jobs.	CaptNemo131	t1_dawpd8a
t3_5h0dha	t1_dawqaab	1481138412	It's still a win for the US, no? Our state gets to tax the factory because it's in US, not abroad. Also, we get a handful of robot-tech jobs and factory supervisor/admin/security jobs that we wouldn't have without the factory, even if it is mostly automated. Plus, our power companies do more business to keep the factory running. A bunch of small things add up.       Hell even if it's 100% automated isn't it still better for the American state to produce it there than abroad?	puppetmaster2501	t1_dawpkq4
t3_5h0dha	t1_dawqglm	1481138615	Absolutely. I'm just saying it won't work the way Trump thinks it will and/or labor costs (and by extension prices) will skyrocket.	CaptNemo131	t1_dawqaab

t3_5h0dha	t1_dawyb2f	1481147448	&gt;So the bottom-line appears to be that assembly could be done in the U.S. if consumers were willing to pay an additional $30-40, rising to around an additional $100 if as many components as practical were manufactured here – but the impact on the job market isn’t likely to be significant.  https://9to5mac.com/2016/06/13/iphone-made-in-usa-cost/	ccooffee	t3_5h0dha

t3_5hbfpj	t1_dazfpbq	1481294707	Why? I can understand your aggravation about requiring Internet, but they need to pay their developers. If the game is fun, I'd much rather them succeed with the pay once model and have unlimited access to all of the levels, than have to constantly buy diamonds or gems or whatever else every other freemium game has when you hit their p2w wall. If Nintendo makes a mint off this, we can likely look forward to Smash Bros, Mario Kart, and who knows what else on mobile.   Edit: Upon reading more into it, I'm even more aggravated about the always-on Internet. If the game is really great, I still support the price in lieu of freemium IAPs, but that DRM is bullshit.

t3_5hehrn	t1_dazp9mv	1481306387	I've had this happen to me a few times. Volume going crazy and what not.   What solved it for me was taking compressed air, and blowing the port out.

t3_5hbfpj	t1_dazpg90	1481306598	Agreed re: being to stop or turn around for that matter. My guess is it's either just an endless running with Mario branding or they were focused on one hand use.	Ezl	t1_dazkzm2

t3_5hehrn	t1_dazwijv	1481314902	Joke answer:  Your phone is merely upgrading itself to remove its aux port functionally to be more like the latest iPhone  Real answer: This is definitely not a software related issue, it is a hardware issue.  Somewhere between you DAC and your headphone jack there is a loose connection and/or contamination.  The only way to fix this would be to replace the hardware.  Damage can often happen if your headphone cords get yanked on in a bad way. You might get lucky and have it only be dirt in the port that you could clean out, but if that doesn't work you are out of luck.	Notfuzz45	t3_5hehrn

t3_5hehrn	t1_db03mfv	1481323999	Do the headphones have a mic? Have you tried the headphones with other phones, and does the same issue occur? Have you tried other headphones with mics with your iPhone? If the issue is only with those headphones, and not with other types of headphones (with mics and without mics), then you know what's causing it.  If the issue persists regardless of mic-less/mic headphones, clean out your iPhone's headphone port. If that doesn't work, then something happened to the contacts inside the port. Turn your phone off and maybe wrap a piece of tape (sticky side out) around an unbent paper clip and try to remove dust from the contacts that way. Or use a dry Q-tip and gently clean it out.   I had a similar problem with my JLab earphones (with mic). The volume would change even when I slightly touched the jack, and Siri/Voice Control would constantly pop up. Tested it with an Android phone and the same thing happened. It was the earphones. The iPhone worked fine with the original Apple earpods and any headphones/earphones without mics.	dinosaur_friend	t3_5hehrn
t3_5hfgws	t1_db0aulu	1481335243	I don't think this is correct when getting replaced. You might have bought one of the models that works on other carriers. The AT&amp;T one does not work on Verizon.	PhillAholic	t1_db03i9m
t3_5hehrn	t1_db0djtr	1481339774	Thank you for the hard attempt to help, it is very much appreciated.   "Do the headphones have a mic?"  A// Yes they do.   "Have you tried the headphones with other phones and does the same issue occur?"  A// Not with other phones no. But I have tried other headphones WITHOUT mics into the iPhone and it does the same. (Just plain headphones, no headset, no mic). The only way in which it doesn't happen is when I plug an aux cable, that goes into a tiny amplifier, that then goes into the headphones. It ends up looking like this:  http://theroundingsound.com/wp-content-2112/uploads/2015/09/Poweradd-Best-portable-Headphone-Amp.jpg  "Have you tried other headphones with mics with your iPhone?" A// Not really, no.  "Clean out your iPhone's headphone port"  I shall do that, I will buy compressed air and will do the q-tip method.  WHY IT MAY NOT BE DUST: Today for example. The problem was happening. It went on for a good 10 to 15 minutes. ...but then... nothing. They worked fine. As if the iPhone was merely trolling me or alive with a mind of its own. I moved the jack, twisted it, turned it, moved the phone, shook it, put it on my pocket, outside, ...whatever I did, and the music was CONSTANT, was clear, was perfect. ...for HOURS. for like... 4 hours in a row. ... But I'm sure that tomorrow it may happen again. Or maybe not. Or maybe 1 week from now. Or maybe 5 days in a row. Like I said: It has no pattern! It's the scary part. It behaves as if it is software in my opinion (but that's just my opinion based on what I percieve which I'm sure isn't the full scope)	DoggydogFA	t1_db03mfv
t3_5hehrn	t1_db0easo	1481341076	Have you checked your volume buttons? They may be stuck and causing random volume changes.  Another theory: maybe your case is misaligned with your volume buttons, it might be pressing them!	WafflesEXE	t3_5hehrn
t3_5hehrn	t1_db0eimb	1481341440	As the OPost above states, the buttons seem perfectly fine and I've tried it without the case as well :( it isn't the buttons I'm 99.999% sure of that	DoggydogFA	t1_db0easo
t3_5hehrn	t1_db0f1vr	1481342382	I see! Sorry that didn't fix your problem.  Maybe your headphone port connection is slightly corroded due to moisture over the years, resulting in a bad connection.  Although I'm not entirely sure if yours is a case of a corroded port, but here's how to clean one:  Switch your phone off first...  1) with a q-tip dip lightly in distilled white vinegar, then insert it into your headphone port and scrub the connections   2) then with another q-tip soak it in a little isopropyl alcohol and flush out the port  Make sure your port is clean before you do this, so you won't jam any lint or dust deeper into the port.  You may have to repeat the steps if it doesn't work for the first time. However if this method fails after 3 or more tries this is probably not the solution you need.  Best of luck!	WafflesEXE	t1_db0eimb
t3_5hehrn	t1_db0hnca	1481347419	Thank you so much!  Hmm.. do you think this should be done -after- compressed air? Maybe both things? what would work best?   I'm just a bit scared of inserting a wet q-tip into a port even if it can be done safely, it is merely a dumb irrational concern of mine. I'll do it if I have to of course  Again thank you so so much!	DoggydogFA	t1_db0f1vr
t3_5hehrn	t1_db0ig6b	1481349138	I've never used compressed air before, so assuming it's used to blow out lint and dust from your port, use that before cleaning your port with vinegar. Just be sure your port is lint free.  Inserting a wet q-tip into a port will be fine, if you let the moisture dry out afterwards.  You are very welcome! Hope this works for you :-)	WafflesEXE	t1_db0hnca

t3_5hehrn	t1_db161vn	1481401304	I think what you need to do is get hold of another phone and test all of the headphones you used with your iPhone on the other phone. Because both of your headphones may not be functioning correctly. If you still have issues with the other phone, then you know for sure that it's the headphones.  It very well could be a software/driver issue. I'm having an issue with iOS 10 right now which causes all sound to stop working on my phone if I plug my earphones in while my phone is connected to its charger. I'm 90% sure that this is an iOS 10 software-driver issue after reading a few Apple threads about it--iOS 10 gets confused and causes the sound drivers to malfunction when more than one port is plugged.  Or it could be a hardware issue. But I never had the issue come up on iOS 9 or under.  If you really do feel it's a hardware issue, back up your phone with iTunes and set it up as a new phone and use it for a couple of hours to a few days and see if the issue comes up. It's not an ideal solution, but it might solve the issue. At this point there are so many issues with iOS 10 that it's hard to differentiate hardware from software issues (see: constant battery problems affecting iPhone 6 series and up on iOS 10).	dinosaur_friend	t1_db0djtr

t3_5hm9r8	t1_db17okd	1481403732	iOS 10.1.1 does have battery drain issues no doubt. But, keeping things like facebook, instagram, and Twitter open in the background with "background app refresh" on will obliterate your battery. The Facebook app is known to be one of the biggest hogs with battery consumption. Additionally, poor cellular signal can also be a battery killer.	iluvkenbone	t3_5hm9r8

t3_5hm9r8	t1_db18fva	1481404862	I have my settings set up to conserve as much battery as possible, I have background app refresh off and location on for maybe one or two apps. As I said, I legit didn't use it between say 10am and 6pm and yet my usage/standby times both say 11 hours 34 minutes. I'm hoping that its to do with the software but I'm not sure how likely it is.	tyger2020	t1_db17okd
t3_5hm9r8	t1_db1axhw	1481408550	Agree with all of this, especially the cell reception mention. I recently moved to a new part of town and noticed the cell reception in the bedroom frequently wavers between 2 dots and "No Sevice" and I found my battery was dropping overnight from 100% to 40% which was really odd. So one night I turned on Aiplane Mode in Control Center and then tapped Wifi and BT back on so I could use it in bed still, and that fixed the overnight battery drain problem. 3-5% drain instead of 50-60%. The phone must've been constantly searching for a signal when it would drop out and kill the battery as a result. It might be worth trying, OP. Good luck!	pennza	t1_db17okd

I think 10.2 is meant to be releasing fairly soon anyway, but if you can't wait, definitively sign up for the public beta.	Welshazam	t3_5hm9r8

t3_5hm9r8	t1_db1bs8c	1481409847	My cell reception is pretty standard 3/5 stars - but I had the phone for a good 6-8 weeks before and the battery life was really good, which makes me think it could be because of 10.1.1	tyger2020	t1_db1bax1
t3_5hm9r8	t1_db1c3vq	1481410337	It's a known issue with 10.1.1 so many have found there is an update available thru iTunes. Plug your phone in and see if there is an update	nthknd	t3_5hm9r8

t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3jwxz	1481553131	I went from the 6 to the 7+ and the camera was the single biggest upgrade. The home button/Touch ID is also nice. Performance wise, the 6 is plenty fast and I didn't notice too much of a change. All the other differences were from going from a regular size to the plus model.   I only upgraded because I ended up breaking my screen and it just wasn't worth the repair cost.	FictionaI	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3kblm	1481553767	only difference in my usage was front camera, the rest is pretty much the same, I miss my space gray 6.8mm thick iPhone 6	vyktorjonas	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3kva5	1481554609	Running my iPhone6 on iOS 10.1.1 is laggy and annoying. It takes quite some time for apps to launch. The iPhone7 processor is significantly faster, so I imagine it is lightning quick.  However, it's not so annoying as to make me want to upgrade, so I don't plan to.	kickstand	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3l7qa	1481555124	Aw, I just upgraded from my space grey 4.7 6" to a jet black 7+ yesterday. I actually got kinda nostalgic and sad when I traded my phone in, *(for a $250 Best Buy giftcard, holy shit)* - because it's the first phone I've ever owned in my 8 years of smartphones that actually lasted the full two years. Yeah, the battery got a little sketchy, but still.	mariofasolo	t1_db3kblm
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3lanf	1481555244	I did it, It's a pretty good phone.	AaronTheLlama	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3lvlm	1481556068	I did the upgrade well worth it! Love the camera more space for memory and oh yeah shits waterproof! I would highly suggest it	kalash4769	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3mh5c	1481556908	I was using my iPhone 6 from launch until about two weeks ago when it suddenly died. It ended up being cheaper to upgrade to the iPhone 7 and renew my contract than repairing the iPhone 6.   Anyway, in everyday usage, the only noticeable difference in my use was the back camera which is SIGNIFICANTLY improved. To be completely honest, it was a pretty disappointing upgrade. Unless you take a lot of pictures, I'd highly recommend sticking with the 6 as long as it's working fine.	WellHeyThere	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3oibb	1481559502	I think so.    Things I've noticed:  Camera - Much easier to get a decent shot in low light (indoors at night).  The new sensor and the OIS combine to make it harder to get blurry shots.  Also love the OIS for video.  It really smooths out my moderately shaky hands.  I really like the 3D touch too.  It adds another dimension to the UI.  My most used feature of this is direct access to [camera](http://imgur.com/ubesQlh) modes.   I  also really like the taptic engine, and the feedback it gives for various ui elements.  Waterproofing is cool too.  I sometimes soak in the tub reading reddit.  With the 6 i'd stick it in a ziplock sandwich bag.  Now I don't worry about it.  I've dropped it in the bath once already.  No problem.  So it depends on whether it's enough of an upgrade for you.  I was due for a carrier upgrade, so it made sense for me.  I was a little disappointed that it was only a little better than an S upgrade, since I've been used to getting the numbered upgrades which are usually big design changes (4,5,6 rather than 4s,5s.6s).  That will probably sting next year when the 10th anniversary edition likely drops.	gerwen	t3_5hwu2q

t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3pjl4	1481560796	I went from a 6+ to a 7.  The camera is certainly better.  The battery life is about the same.  I don't know if it's worth it though.    I did it because I don't like having the + in my pocket, it's just too large.	Mrredditorson	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3prvl	1481561079	I did the same (6--&gt;7+) so for me it felt like a huge upgrade. If it had just been to the 7, I think it would have been nice update, but not drastic. I usually upgrade every two years, but unless some dramatic happens with the 8, I can see switching to every 3 years.	dranobob	t1_db3jwxz

t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3q2j6	1481561438	I went from the 6 to the 7 and I don't regret it.  It's hella faster, takes better pictures and my battery was kinda meh on the 6 after 2 years.	ambushka	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3q2uj	1481561448	I moved from a 6+ to 7+ and the difference is night and day. Its so much snappier, camera is amazing, the fingerprint sensor is instantaneous, the extra RAM and processor speed are noticeable. I believe it utilizes LTE better as well. One thing I have really noticed is the onboard DAC makes the audio sound a lot better. I use the adaptor to plug into my car and my music sounds a lot better  edit: Thank you /u/theredwoodcurtain for pointing out that it would not be a DAC because it's not an analog input. I am by no means an audiophile, but I do love a good pair of headphones and have recently started a cmoy headphone amp build	Locke_N_Load	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3q49o	1481561495	With the 7 you get   1) a better camera (especially in low-light with optical image stabilization, more megapixels, and 1080p HD recording)  2) 3D Touch (I use it all the time, but many people don't or simply forget about it)  3) way faster touch ID   4) An even faster CPU  You will be giving up  1) a headphone jack  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯	adamsak	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3qbpw	1481561746	Personally I'd wait at least another year. I had a 5s (and it was still super fast and no problems) but I thought that upgrade was worth it but if you've got a 6 there's not much reason to upgrade unless you want force touch really bad (that started on the 6s right)	mrwinter	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3qc9x	1481561764	Yes, I moved yesterday to 7+ 256gb Jetblack and it´s amazing, totally worth it!	Lfuz75	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3qdeg	1481561804	Same. Big screen takes a little getting used to (the weight as well) but now I could never go back. It's the perfect size and the camera is pretty fantastic.	bunchofbollucks	t1_db3jwxz
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3qiqz	1481561986	If they had the two cameras on the 7 as well as the 7+ then I would have upgraded for sure. But without that I'll be sticking with my 6 for another year, so long as it lasts. I'm still perfectly happy with it, it still runs smoothly and has plenty of battery life each day. So until either it stops working so well, or the upgrade has some great new features that I actually care about, I'll keep my 6.  Best thing to do is just to look at the features, and think about which ones you care about, and whether they're worth it for you. If not, wait to see what comes next year, maybe you'll be glad you did.	vyper248	t3_5hwu2q

t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3qw9o	1481562439	That's good to hear. Thinking of going from 6+ to 7 and my biggest concerns were battery and the camera. Switching carriers, so need a new phone anyway.	NotSoSecretFootballr	t1_db3pjl4

t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3rzzg	1481563765	I think you're being downvoted because there is no DAC in the 7.  If there was digital to analog conversion, there would be an analog port, which has been removed.  The DAC is now in the dongle.	theredwoodcurtain	t1_db3q2uj
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3saot	1481564121	You're right DAC is not what I was looking for, thank you. I will stand by my opinion that my 7 plus with adaptor sounds much better that my 6 plus did.

That's with lots of email, texts, reddit, music streaming, and social media. Usually get home with at least 40% left.   With my 6s, it was always a struggle.

t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3szo8	1481564924	Can't speak to 6 to 7... but 6 to 7+ was worth it IMO.  I wasn't going to upgrade because I didn't think there were enough changes. But I ended up breaking my 6 (no really... accident).   - Went from a 16GB 6 to a 32GB 7+. The extra space is _incredibly_ nice (I'd have liked to have gone bigger, but supply was scarce).   - I'd heard that battery life in the 6+ blew the 6 away. I see that in the 7+ as well. Battery lasts much longer.   - Digging the bigger screen. It took me a long time to get used to the 6 from my 5s. It didn't take me any time at all to get used to the 7+ size coming from the 6. Very pleased with it.   - Portrait mode in the camera is pretty sweet. I've got cute kids, so I abuse the hell out of that feature.	charliegriefer	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3t9os	1481565254	Apparently the deal just started yesterday, at the Best Buy Mobile store I went to in a mall in Columbus. All iPhones 6 or newer, $250 gift card. I used the $250 as the 2-year AppleCare payment ($130), the tax on the new 7+, ($80), and a new case ($40) and have $3 left, lol.

t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3tu6b	1481565919	I would say it absolutely is.  The gains in the processor (quad core vs dual core) and the camera are more than worth it.	_rlegg	t3_5hwu2q

t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3uuhm	1481567092	IMO, barely. I thought the headphone jack would be not that huge of a problem, but I am honestly a bit annoyed by the lack of one more often then not. Unless something significant happens with the iPhone 7S or 8, this will likely be my last iPhone.  I've been on board since the iPhone 5 and I'm ready for a phone that actually brings something new to the table. Or at least doesn't remove features from a device because "courage".  I really think Apple has lost it's touch with the consumer and is unable to innovate new things in their devices to keep things interesting.  Microsoft is listening and rapidly becoming very consumer friendly, something that Apple used to be very good at.  I say... if the jack is something you never use... go for it.	tbomega	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3uw22	1481567141	I just upgraded from the 6 to the 7plus and yes, it definitely is worth it. I'm in love with the significantly better camera and the fact that it seems more responsive than my 6 was. I also like the bigger screen and some of the features that come exclusively with the 7 and 7plus, too. However, if you could care less about the camera quality and some of the other bits and bobs, just save yourself the money and stick with the 6, as it's still a dann good phone.	crabzinthewater	t3_5hwu2q

t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3v8m4	1481567542	I literally just did this upgrade yesterday. Went in to see if I could get a better contract, walked out with a 7.

The touch ID is wicked fast and the camera is glorious. If you can get a good deal, I say do it :)	Rizface	t3_5hwu2q

I'd probably hold on for the 8.  If you really try, you can find some differences, but when it comes down to everyday use, they're pretty much the same. People try to justify dropping £700 on a new phone by saying how much better it is - I do when people ask me. But in all honesty, its not worth it at all.	kurnelk	t3_5hwu2q

t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3wjkg	1481569024	I just upgraded from the 6 to the 7+.  My thoughts are as follows:  -  The bigger screen is really nice, but I honestly do not notice the increased resolution on that size display.  -  The added battery life is extremely noticeable.  Maybe because most of my usage is listening to music/podcasts via bluetooth, the screen isn't on that much.  -  The camera takes better low light photos, but if I zoom in even a little bit on photos of any lighting, it starts to take on a water-color effect.  It's not just blurry; it's sort of....runny.  My 6 did a better job in some ways.  This was probably my biggest disappointment regarding the 7.  I'm thinking of looking into 3rd party camera apps to see if shooting RAW fixes this.  -  Rise to wake has not blown my socks off, but I am surprised how often I use 'hey siri' now that it is always on.  -  It is extremely fast and I don't think I've yet had to reload a safari tab/app.    -  3D touch is as much a gimmick as it looked.  Cool concept, not really that important yet.  -  Stereo speakers are cool.  I can set the phone down in the middle of a room and it is perfectly audible.  The sound can get a little tin-like at higher volumes/pitches though.    - Home button is fine.  Works with purple nitrile gloves at work too, which is a plus for me.  -  Not a fan of the lighting earpods.  Every time you plug them in/pull them out is a time later that the port won't work.  And putting the device in your pocket while plugged into the earpods just feels like the thing is bending at the port and something is going to snap.  I've taken to using bluetooth earbuds, but honestly it's a downgrade from having a normal headphone jack.  I have to remember to charge the things daily and the sound isn't quite as good.  Overall I was a little underwhelmed.  I'm probably going to keep it since my 6 was having desperate battery trouble despite an Apple genius saying everything was "fine".  What can you do?	Tech_Philosophy	t3_5hwu2q
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3wkmb	1481569057	i haven't really found 3d touch to be very useful myself.  For most apps it's just a shortcut that saves a single additional click or gesture, like the Camera ...

t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3x1z4	1481569614	That's understandable. I mainly use it to preview things and in some App Store apps it comes in handy to quickly go to a specific thing instead of waiting for the app to load and then going where I need to go. Like I said it's not really a game changer but it's nice to have.	SomeRandomProducer	t1_db3wkmb

t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3xmpq	1481570277	The iphone 7 is also massively faster than the 6 and you'll notice many fewer app and webpage forced reloads due to memory. /u/throwaway129458/	LUMiNARY_ATL	t1_db3mh5c
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3xy3n	1481570640	i think it has potential for better future use, for sure.  I just wonder how much R&amp;D time they put into it at the cost of other improvements that could have potentially been more useful.   I remember being disappointed in it when I first previewed it in the store even... just a "nice to have", not a "can't live without it".	standardtissue	t1_db3x1z4
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3ypdx	1481571502	Of course. To be fair, I also needed a working phone and didn't have a backup phone which somewhat forced my hand. I ended up getting the iPhone 6 repaired by a third party company (still at great cost since it required board-level repair, but significantly less than Apple's replacement price) and will probably give my old phone to a family member.	WellHeyThere	t1_db3wio9
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3yrh4	1481571567	honestly, try getting a pair of bluetooth earbuds. I have been using them for a few years now and have never even considered going back to regular earbuds.

t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3yuc1	1481571657	Yeah, agreed. My 6 had touchID as well, but the sensor on the 7 seems vastly improved.	FictionaI	t1_db3wm45
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3yvn2	1481571697	On paper, absolutely. The new A10 Fusion processor is unbelievably beefy. In actual everyday use though, I haven't noticed any difference in speed. *Possibly* less page reloading in Safari, but it's also not something super noticeable.	WellHeyThere	t1_db3xmpq
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3yzcx	1481571811	I couldn't stand the 6+ because of how slow it is. I honestly think it was slower than the 5S in many cases. The 7+ (and for that matter 6S also) is buttery smooth at all times and rarely requires app reloads.	LUMiNARY_ATL	t1_db3yvn2
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3z5n5	1481572005	Yea, just use 3D touch on the very left edge of the screen	Idontlooklikeelvis	t1_db3xcrh
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3z6kx	1481572034	I know I've heard a lot of complaints about animations in iOS being somewhat stuttery on the 6+ basically since launch. I didn't notice anything like that on the smaller 6 and now 7, though.	WellHeyThere	t1_db3yzcx
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db3zggy	1481572337	My problem with the 6+ was that if I swapped apps, any app, it would fully reload and it would even reload tabs in safari when you swapped between them and stuff. It was really terrible. Now the 6S+ VS the 7, I honestly can't tell much of a difference now. I probably should have skipped this gen.	LUMiNARY_ATL	t1_db3z6kx
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db40g52	1481573436	I certainly thought so. The new home button takes a little getting used to (I wish I could disable haptic feedback entirely), but once you're over that hump it's by far the best phone Apple have ever made.  IMO battery life is much improved by disabling background app refresh.	grepnork	t1_db3jn7j
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db40ptg	1481573740	Interesting.  I thought the battery drain was a little fast.  Just turned off background refresh.  Let's see what happens.  I actually like haptic feedback.  I have it on the highest setting.  If you have it set to activate on rise (or whatever that setting is) you can also set it to touch home button to open, and you don't have to keep "pressing" to feel the haptic feedback when opening the phone.	youweremyhero	t1_db40g52
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db43y7c	1481577391	I've had background app refresh disabled since I experienced the iPhone 5 battery bug - IME it makes a huge difference so please let me know how it works out for you.  I turned off raise to wake because I bought a second hand Apple watch, which basically rendered that feature irrelevant, I also switched 3D touch to firm and the haptics to minimal on home and disabled the rest entirely.  I work in UI design and on some level I resent having to be convinced the fake button is real - there also seems to me to be a perceptible delay between touching the button and the shake which annoys me.	grepnork	t1_db40ptg
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db44a6o	1481577779	Yeah but why is it slow/ Does it really take a big processor to move apps around on a screen? Or open apps? I'm afraid to upgrade on my iphone 6 to ios 10 because I suspect they are just slowing shit down to make you upgrade.	kajagoogoo2	t1_db3yzcx
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db44dnl	1481577888	I already have $70 in-ear headphones. They require a 3.5mm jack.	kajagoogoo2	t1_db3rtl4
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db44g6v	1481577969	That's cool, too bad your battery is slowly becoming worse, so of course the battery 'seems' to last much longer in a brand new phone. 1 year from now you'll be having similar complaints.	kajagoogoo2	t1_db3sl60
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db461qm	1481579824	I got the 6S around March or April of this year and the battery was shit from the beginning. Took it to Apple and they did their "diagnostics" and confirmed battery health was at 100%.  So, yes, I can agree that battery will probably get worse, but for now, it's already far and away a superior experience to that of the 6S.	snortWeezlbum	t1_db44g6v
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db46d9t	1481580201	The pair I do have is such a hassle due to the short battery life. Plus I had the misfortune of buying a pair of wired Bose QC headphones 3 months before the Bluetooth ones came out.	tbomega	t1_db3yrh4
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db46evo	1481580255	And it also doesn't end up being cheaper since you end up paying the full price of the phone over the course of the contract	skc132	t1_db3wio9
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db46pgf	1481580611	That's great, I do too.  All I'm saying is that Bluetooth headphone battery life on even a relatively inexpensive pair isn't necessarily as bad as you might think.	theredwoodcurtain	t1_db44dnl
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db47ps0	1481581838	I guess it depends how often you use them. I only ever use earbuds for when I'm working out which gets me about a week of battery life. Other times I'm using my desktop or car speakers to play my music.	Xaxxus	t1_db46d9t
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db48p6a	1481583094	Have a look at the oneplus 3T. I've got a 6 as well and definitely don't recommend upgrading to a 7. If Apple don't do something amazing with the 8, I'm going straight to oneplus.	wickedcriminal	t1_db3z6kx
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db49ukf	1481584571	you can count yourself fortunate if you got it repaired succesfully.  We've taken several devices to local repair shops and the majority of them came back as blotched repairs.   I have a 100 dollar Windows phone that I keep just as an emergency backup.  No, it's not something I would want to use long term but it buys me time when I need to figure out what to do about my main phone.	standardtissue	t1_db3ypdx

t3_5hwu2q	t1_db4a8a2	1481585071	I didn't have iOS 10 on the 6 so I don't know how it performs but I think the major difference was the 1GB vs 3GB of ram. Not the processor specifically.	LUMiNARY_ATL	t1_db44a6o
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db4aiix	1481585434	nothing with apple turns out being cheaper. if you want cheaper there's a million ways to do it, but apple users wants a premium experience of shit that just works, and works well ... and that comes with the cost of doing your share to make them a ridiculously profitable company.	standardtissue	t1_db46evo
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db4alz0	1481585558	I actually did a lot of the troubleshooting myself: my iPhone stopped turning on and did nothing when plugged in. I first plugged it into a USB current meter to see if it was actually pulling current when plugged in, and it wasn't. I then opened up the phone and used a multimeter to test the battery directly, which seemed to be perfectly fine.   Since I was then fairly confident the problem was at the board level, I looked for a local-ish place that offered board level repairs. I knew going in that microsoldering required a crap ton of experience and expensive equipment so I found a place that was reputable and also posted pictures of their setup. When it comes to more basic repairs (screen/battery replacement, etc.) I always do it myself.	WellHeyThere	t1_db49ukf
t3_5hwu2q	t1_db4bxuo	1481587308	I agree with all this except my iPhone 6 was hella slow. Upgrade to 7+ was a big improvement for me.	littlebluekid	t1_db3jwxz

t3_5i0r5n	t1_db4iuzc	1481596362	Blur-related frame drops have plagued iOS since iOS 7. It's just poor software. My iPad mini 2 always had horrible horrible lag and frame drops in the app switcher since iOS 9, iPad Air 2 didn't (most of the time. Let's talk since iOS 9.3). I figured my iPad mini 2 was just old and couldn't handle it. No. iOS 10.2 comes along and randomly fixes it and the app switcher, with the blur, is now smooth as hell. Smoother than the iPad Air 2 on iOS 9.3.    Also, since iOS 7, rotating the keyboard on iPad mini 2 was choppy. So was control center over keyboard. So was sliding up control center over open an folder. So was the keyboard popping up with spotlight. So was rotating the power down screen. So was keyboard popping up in messages. So was creating new tabs in safari from the tab view. So was entering/exiting the app switcher, or using multitasking gestures when a keyboard was on screen.    All of that has disappeared over the course of iOS 9 and 10. We've gotten new issues or continued to keep old ones, but the fact of the matter is the stuttering is software. Inefficient algorithms that newer devices can simply power through. My iPad mini 2 blurs the whole screen at a butter smooth 60FPS when opening folders. So blurring the whole screen is definitely doable for this iPad. Yet sliding down for spotlight is choppy (as it blurs) and going into Siri is choppy. So is "viewing" notifications and especially swiping them down. So is tapping the search bar in Notification Center and widget area. iOS animations are still a mess, performance wise. My 7 Plus even stutters at times which is fucking insane. This phone is an INCREDIBLE performer... but it can't go back to the home screen from the app switcher (coming from an app beforehand) smoothly every time?	uncertain-ithink	t3_5i0r5n

So far two things bummed me out a little, but the reason for these features missing might be able not allowing us developers to do it, so not Cesium's fault:   - I couldn't find a way to create my own playlists   - It doesn't seem to be able to let me download songs from Apple Music  - (Obviously) you can't browse Apple Music artist pages and add new songs to your library through Cesium, but I didn't expect that.   Put into perspective, all of these things are things I don't do every day and I can probably get used to switching to the Apple Music app for. I might have also missed something since I barely used it for 5 minutes just now.	fletchii	t1_db5202y

t3_5ib0g5	t1_db6pv4q	1481728107	I love my 7, I highly recommend it.	BWA_Dallas	t3_5ib0g5
t3_5ib0g5	t1_db6qnpf	1481729170	6S, I just don't think there is enough on the 7 to justify the higher cost. Apple products are good for a few years so a 6s is future proof for the forseable future. Also you do bring a good point with that next iPhone. Its supposed to be dank af and if thats the case it makes sense to spend less now (6S).	CaliforniaWeedBlog	t3_5ib0g5
t3_5ib0g5	t1_db6s7tw	1481731150	If you can get a deal it's worth it. I got mine for $0 on Rogers in Canada, and got a $100 bill credit for switching from my old carrier. Otherwise yeah, 6S is probably a better deal.	enragedbreakfast	t1_db6qnpf
t3_5ib0g5	t1_db6soac	1481731719	If you normally keep your phones for a few years, I would recommend the 7 because of the larger space and newer components. Those will age better than the 6s. However, if you upgrade rather quickly, the 6s is a great phone and you won't notice any difference in usability.	m3n0kn0w	t3_5ib0g5
t3_5ib0g5	t1_db6ssja	1481731865	Thats true, we didn't even mention that, in the US you can practically get a new 6s as a carrier deal.	CaliforniaWeedBlog	t1_db6s7tw
t3_5ib0g5	t1_db6sxx2	1481732047	Yeah I'd imagine in the USits probably even cheaper.	enragedbreakfast	t1_db6ssja
t3_5ib0g5	t1_db6vrnm	1481735424	I'd get the 7. Even if the next iPhone is redesigned, it won't take away from using the 7 for the better part of a year.  The 32GB version doesn't use lower quality internal storage. It's slower because it uses less channels. If write speeds are a concern, then go for the 128GB version. I didn't need the extra storage and I don't mind waiting a few extra seconds to install an app. I put the money I saved there towards AppleCare+.	Anaron	t3_5ib0g5
t3_5ib0g5	t1_db72u6n	1481743572	First, I'd recommend not buying the lowest capacity available and you should also check out the SE if you wanna save a bit of money  Now, out of those two, I'd say go for the 7 if you have the cash. The extra features seem worth it for me, but then again, i haven't tried either so take this with a grain of salt	CMCScootaloo	t3_5ib0g5
t3_5ib0g5	t1_db7jfnj	1481763753	If you don't care about the camera, I would go for the 6s.	Lunarbaby21	t3_5ib0g5
t3_5ib0g5	t1_db7siej	1481776645	If you're going to buy a phone that you want to last at least a couple years before you think about replacing it, I'd go for the 7, and then keep it a while. However, if you think you're going to want next year's phone even more because of a radical re-design, you may want to go even lower than the 6s, knowing that this is more of a temporary phone that just needs to last you ten months until the next phone.	adamsak	t3_5ib0g5

t3_5i2mzw	t1_db7zwju	1481792886	Do you have any opinion on how Cesium hands shuffling? I may be crazy but it seems like shuffle on any apple device (laptop, iPhone &amp; iPod) is weak. I have used my phone exclusively as a music player in my car all semester and it plays the same songs over and over. I have 20GB of music and there are songs I haven't heard once yet while knowing without a doubt I've heard other songs half a dozen times.	FTL83	t1_db504xl

t3_5i2mzw	t1_db83f7z	1481804021	I never use shuffle. Main selling point for me with cesium was being able to select an artist and listen to all their albums in order and night mode.	Iammattieee	t1_db7zwju

t3_5ip7d0	t1_db9wj41	1481907466	I'm going to get the 7. The hissgate problem is pretty rare and I haven't really heard of problems with the home button, since there are no moving buttons after all. The biggest problem I see is the lack of a headphone plughole, but if you can live without it and have the money, definitely go for the 7. BUT to be honest I would try to hold on to the one plus for a year and get iphone 7S / 8 , because this year's phone is a lackluster and next year's model is rumored to get some pretty cool features!

t3_5ip7d0	t1_db9z47w	1481910655	If you don't mind not having a headphone jack and you want the latest model, get the 7. If you want more storage and a headphone jack, get the 6S. Assuming that they're at the same price point.	alpieee	t3_5ip7d0

t3_5ip7d0	t1_db9zzz1	1481911731	I've had a 6+, 6s+ and now 7+. And i would recommend the 7(+). It feels a lot smoother than either of the previous, plus the battery life is outstanding. I don't think my lightning earbuds sound the best but audio Bluetooth (to my car) sounds excellent. The only thing I miss about not having a headphone jack is being able to twist the wire when I'm on a con call and the cord gets a little tangled. But as someone else previously pointed out, the 7 earbud cord seems to have been modified slightly to prevent tangles vs the previous earbuds. Go with the 7/+!	hazymac	t3_5ip7d0
t3_5ip7d0	t1_dba03gr	1481911851	&gt; Not that I'd ever actually use them for any regular use on a phone.  HD800 has 300ohm impedance. You should definitely not use them without a proper amp lol.  I tried both with my ath m70x and 6s definitely felt more natural. I was listening using TIDAL HiFi. Probably wouldn't mater with any other source.  http://bgr.com/2016/09/20/iphone-7-headphones-jack-sound-test/	pootluck	t1_db9z93i
t3_5ip7d0	t1_dba0740	1481911977	Highly recommend the 7.   - Supposedly, battery was a software bug that was fixed in 10.2. I never had a problem with battery drainage, but it was apparently fixed for the users who did. Battery on my 7+ is amazing, it can easily last me a whole day from 8am to midnight.  - I've never noticed hissgate on mine, but I've heard it's super subtle and can easily go unnoticed.  - The new home button is just awesome. It feels much more sturdy and firm than the old home button. At first I thought it was weird, but now I wouldn't ever go back. Whenever I use my friend's older iPhones (without the new home button), the button feels cheap and wiggly.   There are many little things that make the 7 great. Take the new Taptic Engine for example. I can't even explain how good that is, you'll just have to use it yourself.	iAppleTweaker	t3_5ip7d0
t3_5ipbti	t1_dba0h56	1481912315	Is this on 10.2?  Since I've had my iPhone 7 Plus the Bluetooth in my car would play kinda fast forward randomly and then silence.  With 10.1 it would randomly just do the fast forward thing but fix itself after a few seconds.  I'm on 10.2 now and have only been in my car once since I updated and it played fine my entire trip.	pooponagoose	t1_db9y1on

t3_5ip7d0	t1_dba20gz	1481914176	I needed a new phone back in late sept. I could have gotten whatever I wanted. I went with the 6S. Here's why:  7 kept same design for third year. Seriously Apple? Wtf?  Lack of headphone jack. I freaking hate Bluetooth with the fire of a thousand suns.   I don't game, so real world performance, unless they're sitting next to each other I would never know a difference.   Saved a few dollars. No matter how much money one has, it's smart to save.

t3_5iurv8	t1_dbb6y0q	1481993034	I had the same problem a while back. I think these instructions helped me. Basically try step 3.   1. Update Windows, update iTunes and make sure your iPhone is running the latest firmware. Restart your iPhone and PC. And connect your phone using the original Apple USB cable.  2. Make sure your iPhone trusts your computer.  3. Update iPhone drivers. open Control Panel &gt; Hardware and Sound and then look for Apple iPhone under the "Unspecified" section. Right-click on it, choose "Properties" and then click the Hardware tab. Click Properties and then the Change settings button. Click on the Driver tab and Update Driver… and then Browse my computer for driver software. Now navigate to C:\Program Files\Common Files\Apple\Mobile Device Support\Drivers and click Ok, then Next. You'll either see a message saying that the best driver is already installed, or a new driver will be installed. If the latter, your iPhone should now show up in iTunes.

t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbbcnr1	1482001547	I have been noticing in the past week that my iPhone 6 battery life has been abysmal. Also, my phone has been getting really hot recharging and also during some basic web surfing. Honestly, I don't know if I can attribute these issues to an update. All I know is that the Battery Life app told me at the end of November that my capacity was 1700/1750mAh. Now I am only getting 1200/1750mAh. Is that because of an update or is my battery finally kicking the bucket? I don't know. All I know is that my Applecare+ expired on December 11th and I am shit out of luck on a cheap replacement or repair. And I can't afford a monthly payment on a phone right now.  But, if it is an update, then hopefully it will be fixed soon, otherwise I am buying a battery and a repair kit to try and fix this thing myself. (I am over an hour away from an Apple store, so it would cost me more to have them repair it if you count in the cost of the gasoline I would have to spend to get there and back.)	camplightsatnight	t3_5ivpsq
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbbcv4m	1482001849	My iPhone just shut off at 57% battery saying that it needed to be charged. I plugged it back in and it was still at 57%...  Yeah I don't get what the update did to my 6S.	Auterbot	t3_5ivpsq

t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbbdxjg	1482003424	My iPhone 6 went from 29% to 1% in a matter of 5 minutes. It was sitting idle on the home screen. I wish the recall on the 6S applied to the iPhone 6 too, because so many people have the same issues with the 6 as others do with the 6S. I bet you if I were to plug it in right now, it would immediately jump up to like 35%. I should've just waited 6 months and I would have had a 6S and a battery recall to use right now.	camplightsatnight	t1_dbbcv4m
t3_5ijbub	t1_dbbeli5	1482004430	OK. In general I'm not having any troubles adjusting to the larger size. It's a big advantage for me not having to use my reading glasses to see the screen. Taking advantage of Reachability I can use the phone 1 handed for about 50% of the activities. I have no trouble using Mail and Antenna (Reddit client) one handed. Already I automatically reach out my other hand when it's necessary.   The iPhone 7 Plus does fill up my pants pockets a bit more but I'm getting used to it. I don't wear tight pants so it's not an issue. I was worried if it would fit into the cup holders in my car but it still does so I don't need to look at any car holders or such.   My old docks and such obviously don't fit so I had to discard those. I was able to 3D print a nice stand/dock so I'm using that for the time being.   It's interesting to see apps that are not built for the 7 Plus screen size - reminds me of the gold old days of doubling apps for iPad viewing.  Most are ready to run however. I almost never use my phone in landscape mode so some of the special landscape views like for Mail don't have any interest for me. And I don't like typing on the landscape keyboard.   My typing is still pretty crappy due to the change in screen size for the keyboard. Guess that will smooth out in time.   The battery life isn't as good as I was hoping but I think that two apps I use often - Messenger (Facebook) and Antenna are not battery friendly in their current versions. This is usually fixed in updates.   Hope that helps. So far I'm having no second thoughts about the size. Everything is significantly faster (even network access) so that's a nice bonus.   The only aspect that isn't thrilling me strangely is the haptic home button. Although I've read a lot of folks saying that the haptic feedback simulates a real button well I don't agree. To me when I click on the button it feels like the back of the phone is clicking and not the front. I assume that's where the haptic engine is located. I've tried all 3 levels and it's still nothing like a button. It's still the only thing that's bugging me and of course even if I had an iPhone 7 it wouldn't matter so no sense being too annoyed.   Glad to answer any specific questions also...	tsdguy	t1_db9vnob

I've been following this [thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7720595?start=795&amp;tstart=0) at apple support in which many users have the same problem, before the update I've never had a problem with the phone.	okok1	t3_5ivpsq

t3_5ijbub	t1_dbbhyat	1482009532	I just did some extensive Internet searching and sadly could find no authoritative explanation of when you get a SIM ejector with an iPhone.   Apple does not say on it's SIM FAQ technical page.	tsdguy	t1_dbbhi1y
t3_5ijbub	t1_dbbip8h	1482010699	The 7 may be different then -- i havent had to do any troubleshooting with them that require opening the SIM tray.	PortraitBird	t1_dbbesah
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbbiqov	1482010762	At least we have cool new emojis to use!!	joatworthy	t1_dbbcv4m
t3_5ijbub	t1_dbbirup	1482010811	The SIM tray hole on the 7 is the same size as it was on my 5s and back then my 4s and 3s. Maybe I just have fat paper clips but I could never find one thin enough to stick in there.	tsdguy	t1_dbbip8h
t3_5iwh8w	t1_dbbjvmj	1482012551	To be fair, the App Store reviews currently average at 2.5/5, so I wouldn't say it's "overrated", so much as it is blindly praised by too many people.	ThatsBullocks	t3_5iwh8w
t3_5iwh8w	t1_dbbk82v	1482013101	I think he meant overrated as in #1 top grossing.	Cyberbeni	t1_dbbhuwc
t3_5iwh8w	t1_dbbnz06	1482019031	The appeal is that it's a 2D Mario platforming game. Nintendo has been nailing this genre out of the park for 3 decades. You're either into it or you're not.	replus	t3_5iwh8w
t3_5iwh8w	t1_dbbo0n7	1482019103	What's your point? I'm a huge Mario fan.  They didn't nail it this time.	rudedood	t1_dbbnz06
t3_5iwh8w	t1_dbboxc9	1482020529	It's fun, and it's Nintendo's first real attempt at taking mobile gaming seriously. It's $10 because they choose not to nickel and dime everyone via micro-payments. It's fun and I could definitely play it for a month and feel like I got my money's worth.  Their next game will be much bigger and much better. My only complaint is that the game should be landscape and not portrait.	The_Pip	t3_5iwh8w
t3_5iwh8w	t1_dbbq41v	1482022388	I actually think it's fun!! Previous mario' aims is to pass the stage, but this Mario's aim is to kill creeps and get coins.  I unlocked the full version, and the stages after the demos, elements changes in the stage when you take purple/black coins, not only it take a lot more skills, but also your memorising skills	pw5a29	t3_5iwh8w
t3_5iwh8w	t1_dbbq8bb	1482022580	Maybe if you actually explained why this wouldn't be a such a shitpost.  Saying it's not innovative isn't really a criticism. It's supposed to mobile mario, that's it. not something drastically new. and i feel they accomplished exactly that it's great.	wubwubturtle	t1_dbbo0n7
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbbqe5m	1482022835	Same. I booked an appointment with Apple about a week ago, that appointment is in 30 minutes from now.   My phone dies about 40% and discharges so quick (left it at 100% last night, woke up and it was at 60%, within an hour of being idle it died).	kensaiD2591	t1_dbbcnr1
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbbr878	1482024188	Oh wow i thought the random restarting was just me. Its happening to me as well.	rageforum	t3_5ivpsq
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbbrz82	1482025363	HOLY SHIT SAME HERE. Except this wasn't the new update: this was iOS 10.1.1!   You might qualify for a battery replacement, though. You also have a 6S. I don't qualify. -_-  Battery was at 57%. Shut off. Tried to turn it on -- got a battery trap, had to go find a charger, and the phone immediately shut off even on the charger. Refused to turn on. Had to wait. It did the same shit again at 33%.   I had to go into a Best Buy to turn my phone back on.  Did it again when I got on the train, and then wouldn't turn on.   I had to wait until I got home, and then charged it. The battery charging symbol came up, then the screen turned blue.   I have an appointment at the Apple Store next Thursday b/c I have to fly to America to get the phone serviced, and I'm already going there to visit family.	OptionalCookie	t1_dbbcv4m
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbbrzyj	1482025394	Let me know what happens. THey likely curved the shit out of you.	OptionalCookie	t1_dbbqe5m
t3_5iwh8w	t1_dbbubtu	1482029022	The game actually turned out better than I expected.	LargeInvestment	t3_5iwh8w
t3_5iwh8w	t1_dbbuv53	1482029851	I agree. Even in world 1 it was very enjoyable. The main aim of the game is not to finish the level which can be done extremely easily and is no fun at all. The main aim is to get all the special coins AND finish the level. Its very challenging and needs some great timing and skills to get it done. The only thing I hate about this app is the always on drm.	DonLeo17	t1_dbbmkgp
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbbuvvo	1482029885	Happening with my 6s as well - did someone say there was a recall for them?	ItWasAMockLobster	t3_5ivpsq
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbbuymz	1482030008	Hardware test showed no issues. They saw a decline with no usage but just told me do a hardware reset. So doing a restore tonight and see how we go.	kensaiD2591	t1_dbbrzyj
t3_5ijbub	t1_dbbv0t2	1482030102	Thank you for that! Ahaha next time I'll remember to RTFM 😂	magicknot	t3_5ijbub
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbbwkuh	1482032660	I did a reset on the 10th, and didn't restore from a backup. Still having issues. Geniuses my dick.	OptionalCookie	t1_dbbuymz
t3_5ijbub	t1_dbbxmal	1482034434	Oh maybe. I don't actually even have paper clips in my house lol	PortraitBird	t3_5ijbub
t3_5iyjhz	t3_5iyjhz	1482034690	What is the light blue dot on my indeed app, its lighter than usual	Crappypunk	-1
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbbxzev	1482035082	My girlfriend and I are having this same issue. She's on 6S, I'm on 6. I had my phone die at 47%. Managed to turn it back on for all of two seconds, in which it bricked, the battery instantaneously dropped from 47% to 1%, and it shut off. Mild cold seems to exacerbate the issue.	nealius	t3_5ivpsq
t3_5iyjhz	t1_dbbytlw	1482036609	What happens when you swap the two apps. Put the dark one in the light ones spot	ryanbliss	t3_5iyjhz
t3_5iyjhz	t1_dbbyxxh	1482036839	They mean the same thing. The shade is determined on the background and where the dot will lay on.	thewizardofash	t3_5iyjhz
t3_5iyjhz	t1_dbbzf42	1482037744	That is not the reason. I've moved the app around and it's the same color, I have however moved the darker ones and they appear a bit lighter but not that light.	Crappypunk	t1_dbbyxxh
t3_5iyjhz	t1_dbbzgxy	1482037837	At first I thought it was a new widget was added as well as the app because when I went to edit widgets it turned back to the normal dark blue but there was no widget for that app	Crappypunk	t1_dbbyxxh
t3_5iyjhz	t1_dbbzsbw	1482038436	I'm guessing that the more recent an app was updated, the darker the blue is, and after time passes it changes to a lighter blue. Same thing happens in Messages. Recent messages are darker and older are lighter.	Fluffybro_Jr	t3_5iyjhz
t3_5iwh8w	t1_dbbzyw3	1482038789	I think he likely meant overhyped, which it is since it's pretty generic as a core gameplay experience.	chlehqls	t1_dbbhuwc
t3_5ipbti	t1_dbc07ba	1482039244	I'm using an AKG Y50bt with an iPhone 7 on iOS 10.2, and my bt connection seems fine (tested it for a few hours yesterday).	BattleBuddha	t3_5ipbti
t3_5iyjhz	t1_dbc4w8p	1482050862	The lighter the blue dot, the longer it has been sitting there updated, but unopened. Similar to how iMessage works. The newest messages are dark blue but earlier in the thread they go light blue.	i_like_reddit_	t3_5iyjhz
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbc60ji	1482054580	My iPhone6 is doing the same, it shut down and is unable to start again (battery low) at strange %, like 30% or 60%.  The battery stat is bugged too, sometimes dropping 10% istantly and without reason.  Example: this morning I browser 5 (FIVE) minutes on Twitter/Reddit and it dropped from 100% to 86%.  OFC this never happened before 10.2 and the battery is working properly.	DaRk_ViVi	t3_5ivpsq
t3_5iwh8w	t1_dbc6cbf	1482055734	I'm guess they made it portrait on purpose just so people can play this game on the go. They seem to be pushing for the one handed gameplay pretty hard.  Landscape would make it a lot harder to play one handed I guess..	andykan	t1_dbboxc9
t3_5iwh8w	t1_dbc9yeo	1482067611	Granted, it's fucking expensive as hell and I hope to god Nintendo at least gives free updates to people who spent the $15AUD on it (unlikely, I know.)  But aside from that it's a simple and fun game. It's a mobile game that is easily accessible for kids, teens, and my Amish mom - I never expected any deep or complex mechanics. **It's just a Mario game without a D-Pad.**  The real meat and bones of the game for me is the Toad Rally where you race with other players' ghosts.	nervonly	t3_5iwh8w
t3_5iwh8w	t1_dbcam1z	1482069314	I'm sure they're taking their 2.5 star App Store raiting and millions upon millions of dollars straight to the bank	roadblocked	t3_5iwh8w
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbcc1re	1482072528	Yeah. I finally got my battery replaced (under the new recall) and things seem to be OK again. No idea what the issue was.	Lantro	t1_dbbwkuh
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbcdrg0	1482075691	It more than likely was a refurb. They don't have to replace it with a brand new unit. Unless your within your buyers remorse and request such.	tr0llallday	t3_5j0pkv
t3_5iyjhz	t1_dbce1hu	1482076161	This isn't the reason, i manually updated all the apps at the same time	Crappypunk	t1_dbc4w8p
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbceamv	1482076594	Odd. The man from the Apple Store said it was new, just in different packaging for replacements. I would hope they wouldn't lie...	Scithmal	t1_dbcdrg0
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbceq1x	1482077272	So you got a new phone because the hiss? How bad is it?	dmartism	t3_5j0pkv
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbcf8f8	1482078072	Usually replacement phones are refurbished phones, but they are practically new, look new and act new. I wouldn't be concerned at all. I've received one or two replacement phones.	TheeBaconKing	t3_5j0pkv
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbcfqcb	1482078826	Technically after it's been refurbished it's considered a new device. I had this issue with Verizon, they told me it was a new device and it wasn't. They kept sending me refurbished devices. Even though they were not refurbished. If their is no physical damage and the device turns on they do a reset and some minimal checks then send it out. I returned a phone and the same day it was received back in they sent it back out. They accidentally told me this when they said I didn't return my phone. Thank goodness I took a picture of the packing label they sent me and showed them the tracking. Any way I know you did this at he Apple Store but they can check a device and make sure it's ok to be sent back out.	tr0llallday	t1_dbceamv
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbcg6b4	1482079501	The quality should be indistinguishable from one in a retail box. Apple also doesn't want used accessories or want to give another set of accessories when you already have them so they only replace the phone after 14 days. You can tell what type you have by going into Settings &gt; general &gt; about and look for the first letter of the model. N means replacement. F means refurbished. ~~R~~ M mean retail.   Edit: Actually M is retail.	Fluffybro_Jr	t3_5j0pkv
t3_5iyjhz	t1_dbcibou	1482082589	Did has it had a couple updates since you opened it maybe?	enragedbreakfast	t1_dbce1hu
t3_5iyjhz	t1_dbcifza	1482082754	Nah, it did it to another app as well. I was just wondering if it was something special	Crappypunk	t1_dbcibou
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbcojqx	1482090403	I have an F for my 7+ that I got on release 😒	HandsomeAssNigga	t1_dbcg6b4
t3_5iyjhz	t1_dbcotvp	1482090756	I mean, it is the reason. I don't know why you have 2 apps updated at the same they are different but the blue goes lighter the longer it's been there.	i_like_reddit_	t1_dbce1hu
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbcp8no	1482091261	It definitely doesn't.   Edit: Nevermind, saw the edit. Now the letters are correct.	FictionaI	t1_dbcg6b4
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbcp9nj	1482091296	Got the exact same thing from them 3 weeks ago about the exact issue. It doesn't fix it.	defroach84	t1_dbbuymz
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbcphrp	1482091572	That's weird. If you got it in a retail box, it should have been M. It could have just had a minor problem like a scratch and they refurbished it with a new exterior.	Fluffybro_Jr	t1_dbcojqx
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbcpjgm	1482091629	I did my restore last night and things don't look better. I have a follow up appointment after Christmas so we'll see what they say then I guess. Phone still dies at 47%	kensaiD2591	t1_dbcp9nj
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbcpumy	1482092012	Now that I checked my model is M. Lol. Thanks for clearing up, I was worried for a bit.   My dumbass checked the serial number.	HandsomeAssNigga	t1_dbcphrp
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbcqv9f	1482093259	I used my phone for 30 minutes today and it's already shut off. You seem to be lucky.	defroach84	t1_dbcpjgm
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbcs1pc	1482094725	I have gotten refurbs before. Check here: https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Models	jgan96	t3_5j0pkv
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbcsg17	1482095213	My model says N. does that mean it's made just for replacements?	Scithmal	t1_dbcg6b4
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbcshb6	1482095255	It used to hiss a ton at any point. This new one hisses a little but not that bad as the other so I'm not bothering to replace it.	Scithmal	t1_dbceq1x
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbcskkb	1482095354	Yeah. Mainly am curious because I want to make sure my water proofing is as good as a new device. I assume with refurbished ones they tear the old water seal out and replace it..?	Scithmal	t1_dbcf8f8
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbcso3m	1482095458	I'm mainly worried about the water seal for the water resistance. Do they replace the seals too? I don't want to get mine near water just incase it could be an old one.	Scithmal	t1_dbcfqcb
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbctl7z	1482096538	If their is no physical damage to the phone I don't see why the seal would be bad too. If physical damage is present they more than likely send it out if it's something they cannot fix in store (I.E. cracked screen) or they have a big backlog.	tr0llallday	t1_dbcso3m
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbctyuc	1482097011	Mine says 'f' and I got mine delivered on launch	Njwest	t1_dbcphrp
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbcvick	1482099016	I don't know exactly what they do in terms of rebuilding, but I would personally be 100% confident with the product as if it was brand new.	TheeBaconKing	t1_dbcskkb
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbcwsm7	1482100730	Was having similar issues with rebooting, decided to see if I had the depleted battery issue—sure enough when the percent reached ~45% while in an app the phone just shut off.  Pressed power button, display showed the battery empty icon. Plugged into power phone said it had 38%	ghostman_on_third	t3_5ivpsq
t3_5j0pkv	t1_dbdh1oh	1482133143	I tried to have mine replaced a while back for the same reason. I also got a refurb, and cosmetically it was fine, but it hissed even louder than the one I originally bought, so I sent the replacement back and I'm still with the original. It's barely noticeable on mine, fortunately.	_rodnii	t3_5j0pkv
t3_5j5jen	t3_5j5jen	1482139712	Holy crap congrats messenger on a milestone like that, thanks for all the bug fixes.	Soundwarp	-1

t3_5j5jen	t1_dbdk5yw	1482142948	Does anyone else get a loud screeching noise after being in a call on messenger for a while over an hour or so? Happened on my 6s plus and 7+ from iOS 9 to iOS 10	Alex1123	t3_5j5jen
t3_5j5jen	t1_dbdkusv	1482145271	Sadly they still forget to add changelogs after 100 versions.	Head-e	t3_5j5jen
t3_5j5jen	t1_dbdkxke	1482145524	I know, Facebook is the most aggressive app I've ever seen. Also EVERY SINGLE UPDATE makes the app bigger, I wonder what the hell are they adding. I mean, it's a stupid news browser and messenger, yet it's like 160MB each. Seriously, wtf.  Pro tip: disable background data for Facebook, it won't drain the battery at all.	majnus	t1_dbdjz6b
t3_5j5jen	t1_dbdmd16	1482149990	Very annoying how they change the UI every fucking week, this week they have made the app to look like Snapchat, fuck off and keep to one design!	BlizzardShot	t3_5j5jen
t3_5j5jen	t1_dbdmsig	1482151174	I always tell people nicely I do not use Facebook messenger once so they are better off sending me a e-mail.

t3_5j5jen	t1_dbdnx1r	1482153916	You can turn it off in settings but it still goes ahead and use background services anyway. So no, you don't need to open the app to get new messages.	dyonisis99	t1_dbdn25m
t3_5j5jen	t1_dbdo07b	1482154105	Check out the app "Friendly." It's essentially the mobile version of Facebook but with push notifications. It also doesn't run in the background constantly so you end up saving quite a bit of battery life.	MyGuyNoah	t1_dbdjz6b

t3_5j5jen	t1_dbdroww	1482160595	The screenshot in the App Store for the conversations view looks so clean and tidy. Wish I could roll back the app to a simpler time.   Also, does anyone actually use messenger day? Out of my hundreds of friends I've only seen 2 people use the snapchat story function on fb messenger.	mrrizzle	t1_dbdmwmb

t3_5j5jen	t1_dbdsk3l	1482161828	Do you guyz realize that each time you scroll up to go to to the first message and it accidentally opens the cam which is annoying and battery consuming..  i use messenger more than any other app which makes me feel like moving to something else	barham90	t3_5j5jen
t3_5j5jen	t1_dbdu1f7	1482163807	push notifications never work for me on that app.	smushednoodle	t1_dbdo07b
t3_5j5jen	t1_dbdve7n	1482165531	Not going to defend Messenger but there are sometimes when you change a piece of code (Change string to stringbuffer for example) that MIGHT improve performance. You will not write in the change log that you did that explicitly. It is better to write Performance Improvements in this case. But yes, some apps are abusing the change logs.	plee82	t3_5j5jen

t3_5j5jen	t1_dbe0fea	1482171659	Yeah... it'd be nice if they'd kind of introduced this shit instead of just dumping it on us. The amount of times I've opened messenger (I use it all the time) and have been like "whoa... it's different, again.." is way too high. It's free and I can't complain, but I feel like communication could be improved a touch.	codingphp	t1_dbdmd16
t3_5j5jen	t1_dbe5p0n	1482177870	I think OP was pointing out that the "change log" for Facebook Messenger has never said anything different than what is shown in the screenshot.	JDeppel	t1_dbdve7n
t3_5j5jen	t1_dbe7lro	1482180074	The size is really annoying me these days, just WHY does it need to be so big?   Twitter, instagram and Skype are all much smaller.	GFoxtrot	t1_dbdkxke
t3_5j5jen	t1_dbe83jh	1482180629	Fucking milestone my ass.  First they force you to install a separate app and then continue to suddenly make that app bigger and bigger and have all kinds of unwanted features no one asked for. This time they decided to try and make a snapchat clone. Wonder what's next.	jmxd	t3_5j5jen
t3_5j5jen	t1_dbe86nk	1482180725	I know...even though I still have like 100GB free it annoys the hell out of me that these apps are so big. "Friendly" does the job of Facebook, messenger and groups combined and it takes ~20MB and stores almost no cache. Facebook, messenger and Groups after few weeks are 1GB+ with their caches.	majnus	t1_dbe7lro
t3_5j5jen	t1_dbe8mg7	1482181225	Notifications screen controls the delivery of new messages. BAR is for syncing conversations and images even if you haven't opened the app for long. But it doesn't matter for FB. They use the VoIP background service for this.	abhinavk	t1_dbdn25m
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbe90c9	1482181654	Mine reset three times yesterday. In that it shut down and wouldn't turn back on until I charged it again. Have another appointment in Wednesday. I'm only running the stocks apps after a restore and the issue is still happening.	kensaiD2591	t1_dbcqv9f
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbe9plg	1482182440	Let me know how it goes. I'm guessing no resolution but if they fix it I'd love to get mine fixed at the Apple Store as well.	defroach84	t1_dbe90c9

t3_5j5jen	t1_dbelcug	1482197242	I just wish that things like the new UI would come in the actual updates, and not just be pushed out directly to the app. That's what updates are for.	snowflakelord	t1_dbe0fea

t3_5jac4p	t1_dbeqqdx	1482204586	My 7+ does this. I shut off the notifications for the stock mail app so it's not that. Next I'll probably shut off the gmail app and see if that fixes it that.	DailyNate	t3_5jac4p

t3_5j5jen	t1_dbeteji	1482208456	I have the Camera option, but all I can do is send it to group chats or individuals; there's no "Messenger Day" option for me yet. I guess as they roll it out to more and more, you'll see more friends use it.	rxmf	t1_dbdroww
t3_5jac4p	t1_dbetznp	1482209359	I had this happen before on iOS 9 too, especially with Facebook Messenger. Usually, if I am at my computer and I am on messenger.com or I have messenger.com open in some tab (but I am not focused on it), sometimes my iPhone will light up without any notifications showing. I check messenger on my computer, and I always have a notification. I am not sure how this is implemented internally, but I notice it happens when I get "double" notified, and the computer notifications are prioritized. Also had this happen sometimes on Gmail notifications.	killerskullz	t3_5jac4p

t3_5jac4p	t1_dbfb6w0	1482247493	does this happen when you're plugged in? I had this issue and realized it's because of a faulty cord plugging and unplugging itself (plugging in a iPhone causes it to wake the screen for a moment)	Spiderpirate	t3_5jac4p

t3_5j5jen	t1_dbfknv2	1482258845	I had to install it the other day to read something....   I think it was 7-8 'no thanks' to entering my mobile and refusing notifications before I was in.  ...then promptly deleted it.	sneijder	t1_dbdjz6b

t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbfrl6t	1482266921	iPhone 6+ owner here with this same issue. I guess I'm not the only one. The Battery Life app says my battery has a 28% battery wear level, which is acceptable. My problems started up just a couple of weeks ago. I've had this problem in the past, but only when my phone was exposed to the cold for prolonged periods (usually when I am skiing). Now it's happening all day and I keep it close to a charger at all times.	zMerovingian	t3_5ivpsq

t3_5jhqgb	t3_5jhqgb	1482290784	I bought an iPhone second hand with broken battery. Will Apple replace it?	jjhats	-1
t3_5jhqgb	t1_dbg9n8g	1482291009	Nope just set up a Genius Bar appointment. This is where apple really shines.	sandyvag69	t3_5jhqgb
t3_5jhqgb	t1_dbg9oyv	1482291076	They won't ask any questions? They would literally need to not ask me my name or phone number for me not to get busted. I'm worried they will make me unlock it once they replace battery.	jjhats	t1_dbg9n8g
t3_5jhqgb	t1_dbg9tfc	1482291256	Yeah Genius Bar is the way to go. And I'm pretty sure battery isn't covered under hardware warranty unless it's some sort of abnormal defect. Batteries have a life cycle, if it's simply used up,  they won't change it for free.   When you plug the phone in it doesn't turn on either?	CrystalBlueOccasion	t3_5jhqgb
t3_5jhqgb	t1_dbg9wtg	1482291395	Can't you just erase the phone and remove her iCloud ?	CrystalBlueOccasion	t3_5jhqgb
t3_5jhqgb	t1_dbgatnf	1482292724	Hmmm, I would assume being plugged into external power even with a bad battery, it should still power on. Maybe there's more to the issue than she let you believe?	CrystalBlueOccasion	t1_dbgafxj
t3_5jhqgb	t1_dbgkfu6	1482317368	Well if you get a repair done you'll have to give them your name. I have bought many 30+ 2nd hand apple products and they have been incredibly helpful every time. Why can't they ask you anything? I thought this was legit?	sandyvag69	t1_dbg9oyv
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbgli3a	1482320609	Just went there again today, they've looked into it and they still see no hardware issues in the diagnostics tests. I kept a record on my phone of when it died, so I had them look into those times and the rep saw clear battery drops - spoke with their supervisor and I'm getting a new battery installed since I'm within warranty period (2 years here). They didn't have any batteries in stock so they're going to call me when they get it in.	kensaiD2591	t1_dbe9plg
t3_5jhqgb	t1_dbgmkt7	1482323521	This is 100% legit I bought the phone and she seemed genuine and gave me all the pass codes and didn't seem like she was lying but until I boot it up I don't know anything. I just know Apple can be difficult and may say warranty covers first owner not the device which is stupid but I'm just paranoid. So you think I should just say I bought this used its not registers under my name yet and it doesn't turn on?	jjhats	t1_dbgkfu6
t3_5jhqgb	t1_dbgoew3	1482327467	Then you have no worries they go by the sn. I have taken many just purchased through clist and offer up. They likely won't question you at all. I have had nothing but helpful people at the Genius Bar. Just set up an appointment. You can tell them you bought the phone on clist it happens all the time.	sandyvag69	t3_5jhqgb

t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbgqmmg	1482331165	I'm curious if a new battery fixes it. If it does, I can suck it up an pay for one (I'm out of warranty).  You mind letting me know whenever you get it in?  I appreciate this response.	defroach84	t1_dbgli3a

t3_5jkcfc	t3_5jkcfc	1482332709	Weird question but, does anyone know of a case that fits like the Apple silicone case after all the silicone has worn off?	travvvvvvv	-1
t3_5jkcfc	t1_dbgsbce	1482333545	I did the same thing. Check out the Ringke [Slim] Lightweight Cover	Mikelightman	t3_5jkcfc
t3_5jkcfc	t1_dbgv4sh	1482337138	Incipio Feather case is pretty great. Have both the silicone and the Incipio and prefer the feather case.	gunner940	t3_5jkcfc
t3_5jkcfc	t1_dbgwzql	1482339379	Not exactly the same, but I really like the Diztronic cases..  https://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Diztronic-Matte-Slim-Fit-Flexible/dp/B00NETYY60/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482339352&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=diztronic+iphone+6&amp;refinements=p_89%3ADiztronic	jdfmcok	t3_5jkcfc
t3_5jkcfc	t1_dbh1dzb	1482344684	Peel has thin cases. [Check them out](https://buypeel.com) I had one, but I wasn't a fan of the feel of the case. Just my opinion.	updraft419	t3_5jkcfc
t3_5jkcfc	t1_dbh32ft	1482346681	The best phone cases for price, thin, light, protection, and durability (everything really) is a TPU case, for example [something like this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Super-Clear-TPU-Transparent-Crystal-Case-Cover-For-iPhone-7-Samsung-LG-3-/162325744433?var=&amp;hash=item25cb5e4b31:m:mwmOgCTfpIDZO8SkLgUSKqQ). They are so stupidly simple but they don't stretch, they dont crack, they are soft and springy enough to crumple into a ball and spring back, and dense enough  to absorb damage for small to medium drops. ideally you would get one thats edge extends very slightly forward beyond the plane of the screen, so that if you lay/drop it face down it won't hit the screen glass first.   There are only 2 issues with cases like this.  1. dirt/grit may tend to get inbetween the phone and the case so occasionally you want to clean it inside (same applies to any phone case though)  2. There's a million variations out there and the pictures are rarely 100% accurate. If you are buying some for $1 on ebay, buy 6 or 7 because some will take 2 months to show up, some will never show up, some will look completely different than the picture	elislider	t3_5jkcfc
t3_5jkcfc	t1_dbh36s6	1482346823	Does it feel like hard plastic?  How grippy is that?  Any issues with button presses (too stiff).	BitingChaos	t1_dbgsbce
t3_5jkcfc	t1_dbhge9b	1482363278	I like [this case](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1RK1PS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). It's super slim and doesn't really feel like there's a case on the phone.	ebshipp	t3_5jkcfc
t3_5jkcfc	t1_dbhn5me	1482373234	I've been using diztronic cases ever since I had an iPhone. They're really great.	Lavaswimmer	t1_dbgwzql
t3_5jkcfc	t1_dbhsmit	1482381839	Can you post a picture of the case?? Mine have never peeled completely 😳	Jeremiareyes	t3_5jkcfc
t3_5jkcfc	t1_dbi73b5	1482416681	This one looks very promising. How far does it wrap around the edge? Can you still feel the curved edge of the glass a little bit?	travvvvvvv	t1_dbgv4sh
t3_5jkcfc	t1_dbi761l	1482416797	I don't recommend peeling it all off. It's nearly impossible to get the last bits where the glue has hardened, and it will almost definitely annoy you enough to drive yourself buy a new case :)	travvvvvvv	t1_dbi6vyc
t3_5jkcfc	t1_dbi78bm	1482416895	What didn't you like about it? I have seen those before and I thought it looked a little _too_ thin. If it were cheaper I might get one just to try.	travvvvvvv	t1_dbh1dzb
t3_5jkcfc	t1_dbi7rf2	1482417717	It was just the feel of the case. I didn't like the material. Felt like new balloons with the powder on it. Just weird to me. Other than that it was great. I think I found a discount by email or something to get mine because it's not the cheapest case to just try.	updraft419	t1_dbi78bm
t3_5jkcfc	t1_dbi8rmb	1482419203	It stops where the glass meets the metal, so you can still feel the edge of the glass. It wont provide much protection if you drop it on the face due to lack of lip over the edges, but its sleek and protects the back from scratches, which is all I really care about.   edit: added image http://imgur.com/LuRwwrJ	gunner940	t1_dbi73b5
t3_5jr0l4	t3_5jr0l4	1482419265	So I finally had to get rid of my Note 7 and came to the darkside...	bolaz	-1
t3_5jr0l4	t1_dbi95ym	1482419769	If you are referring as to inside every app, it seems like it's different in every app. I meant more like an universal back button to go a step back no matter what app or where in the phone you are. (I hope that makes sense)	bolaz	t1_dbi90yx
t3_5jr0l4	t1_dbi9kmd	1482420332	I didn't noticed that on most apps! Good to know, thank you!  An example that I can think of is if you are inside a text message thread, you go back one step from the convo where you see all your messages, instead of pressing the home button I was just used to hitting the back button one more time. It's definitely more of a getting used to type of deal for sure.	bolaz	t1_dbi9bb4
t3_5jr0l4	t1_dbi9u3l	1482420684	There isn't a back button per se, but there is a universal gesture to go back. Slide from the left of the screen to the right. Doing this with force takes you to the previous app. Doing it lightly takes you back to the last page in the app you're in.	Aarondo99	t3_5jr0l4
t3_5jr0l4	t1_dbiaewo	1482421456	Just use another app for media  A lot of them have mini web servers and no need for iTunes   I haven't touched iTunes for months	lost_in_life_34	t3_5jr0l4
t3_5jr0l4	t1_dbibr3p	1482423186	I have the 7 plus as well, get the 12w power adapter. It charges your phone way faster than the power adapter that comes in the box. http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD836LL/A/apple-12w-usb-power-adapter	ginger_savior	t3_5jr0l4
t3_5jr0l4	t1_dbichr8	1482424121	If you miss Reddit is fun, I would recommend trying out Antenna. Not the same app, but I used to use Reddit is fun on my OG Moto G but when I switched I found that Antenna was just as fast to use if not faster.  A good universal trick for anything in iOS is that there is usually a hidden option behind 3D Touch on just about anything. Just take a couple min to 3D Touch all the things like the flashlight in control center and emails in the email app. Enjoy your new phone man! 😁	that_guyq	t3_5jr0l4
t3_5jr0l4	t1_dbicl1e	1482424234	Thanks for the pointers and downloading that app right now!	bolaz	t1_dbichr8
t3_5jr0l4	t1_dbie136	1482426011	Specifically I recommend Google Play Music. You can upload your music to it from the computer without having to connect your device and then just stream it from the app on your phone. You can also download for offline use. I rarely use iTunes at all.	HawkMage42	t1_dbib9dn
t3_5jac4p	t1_dbijgzq	1482432588	No, it just happens at the most random times like it acts like I have a notification when I don't.	thecub1991	t1_dbfb6w0

t3_5jt1ic	t3_5jt1ic	1482440686	How bad is it to not update your iOS?	General_Eats99	-1
t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbiqm8w	1482441490	Unless your a) your phone contains top secret government secrets and you need a locked down phone or b) you want the newest emojis, then it really doesn't matter. You'll miss some features and design changes but most apps support iOS 8.0 or later. It'll be a while before you become incompatible.	NikeSwish	t3_5jt1ic
t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbiqwla	1482441865	Literally this bad -   Taken from Revalation   "When He powered up the iPhone that hadn't been updated, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come.” And another, a red horse, went out; and to him who sat on it, it was granted to take peace from the earth, and that men would slay one another; and a great sword was given to him."	roadblocked	t3_5jt1ic
t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbiqy34	1482441917	I think the major reason to update is for security. Security patches are kinda like insurance, you never really *need* them until it's too late.  On the other hand, updating can slow down your phone a bit. It won't be noticeable at first but after a few updates you'll begin to wonder what happened to your once shiny new iDevice.  But if you're fine with a few vulnerabilities and don't want the "newest, coolest" emojis then don't worry about it.	that_guyq	t3_5jt1ic
t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbir9x7	1482442328	Thanks! I figured it wasn't too big of a deal but I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something.	General_Eats99	t1_dbiqy34

t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbiszvv	1482444619	Besides security and app compatibility (although compatibility can be a reason to delay updates) there are also bug fixes which can include battery drain, connectivity, etc.  Of course an update can cause issues until a later update fixes them. An app I use daily had an issue that required quitting and restarting it frequently. This started occurring when I updated to 10.0, and was fixed with 10.2.  A few years ago there was a PDF exploit that could jailbreak an iOS device just by visiting a website. That's the one that worried me, if it can jailbreak your device it could do something else instead. Unless it's something like that run what you're comfortable with.	BitWise	t3_5jt1ic
t3_5jtdq9	t1_dbit0w4	1482444657	Ahhh gotcha. Okay, that seems silly and kinda understandable at the same time haha	i0BAYi	t1_dbisydc
t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbitr6b	1482445655	A lot of people don't realize how important it is to run the latest version for security reasons. All it takes is one rogue exploit to fuck your shit up. The best you can do is update to the latest version as soon as it's available. It isn't 100% foolproof but it's better than being wide open.	Anaron	t1_dbiszvv
t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbixmbp	1482451235	It also depends what version you are talking about. 10.1.1 to 10.2 very minor.   9.3 -10.X they added a ton of functionality.	whoamanwtf	t1_dbir9x7

t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbj2wzd	1482459029	Silly attitude. Updates add useful features and enhancements. There's no reason not to update, unless you want to jailbreak. Old phones got slower because they had very limited hardware. That's not the case anymore. Modern smartphones are comparably as fast as some notebook computers.	chamferedmind	t3_5jt1ic
t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbj4hqp	1482461283	People can still hack it. You are never safe. NSA can hack you and no apple patch can save you unless the NSA leaks its program. It doesn't matter.	Mrpornogoregrinder	t1_dbiqy34

t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbj78bh	1482465338	You're definitely right but I was thinking more about your everyday, bad-intentioned hacker. Staying up to date will help with preventing them access to your data.

t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbj79a4	1482465378	They?  Apple?  No, Apple pushes everyone to upgrade. If people don't and there's a vulnerability that gets exploited on OP's phone the attackers could conceivably gather their banking credentials.	Anon_8675309	t1_dbiymgr
t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbj9j4v	1482468899	If you're totally fine with lack of security and app incompatibility, then sure, don't update.

And yes, these exploits were initially a government-only thing, but the flaws are published now, so any hacker can take advantage.  If you're not updating your mobile devices - regardless of platform - then you're just a mark waiting to get taken advantage of.	tubezninja	t3_5jt1ic

t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbjhn4y	1482488991	&gt; On the other hand, updating can slow down your phone a bit. It won't be noticeable at first but after a few updates you'll begin to wonder what happened to your once shiny new iDevice.  I haven't really noticed this as much with the newest generations, particularly since 64 bit chips hit the market. I think newer hardware definitely helps, definitely had an impact on older hardware though.	Atlas26	t1_dbiqy34

t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbjycs1	1482518663	Fine, I'll say it. Take advantage of what Apple offers in support and update your damn phone! If you're not jailbreaking, there is no reason not to update your phone. It's not like it takes any actual effort. Update and enjoy your new features. Your 6s also isn't going to see any legitimate slow down from updating iOS versions for a long time.

t3_5jtdq9	t1_dbk6zq0	1482531099	Well that was incredibly misleading. Probably shouldn't say there aren't any apps that have a NSFW toggle in them, because that's blatantly untrue.	CharlesManson420	t1_dbk6umf
t3_5jtdq9	t1_dbk7ah7	1482531559	Misleading by whom? It was an Apple decision some time ago to make the management of NSFW apps a site by site decision. This was because if apps have the capability of displaying NSFW content they had to be marked as over 14 in the App Store so that prevented people from downloading them even if they only wanted to access non-adult content.  By switching to making the apps follow the account preferences they could remove the restriction in the App Store and have a wider distribution of the app.   Makes perfect sense.	tsdguy	t1_dbk6zq0

t3_5jtdq9	t1_dbk7g55	1482531799	Misleading by the person who said there are no Reddit apps that have a NSFW preview toggle in them. There are.	CharlesManson420	t1_dbk7ah7
t3_5jtdq9	t1_dbk7i8l	1482531889	Oh. Well I guess that's technically true but it seems to be a pretty useless feature. Well maybe not if you are running on your work's LAN and they're tracking you then if you get a preview you might expose a NSFW URL for your work to detect.  However in that case you'd have to be happy turning off all previews.	tsdguy	t1_dbk7g55
t3_5jt1ic	t1_dbk8lc2	1482533565	The FBI was using the circumstances to make apple give them the possibility to get into phones. They already could get into phones but it is better to get it from them then spend months figuring it out. This way they could have gotten congress to even pass a law that companies would have to help the FBI get into people's phones like nothing. Hacking takes time but it's easier to get the company to open it.	Mrpornogoregrinder	t1_dbk7e2n

t3_5k0gxl	t1_dbkeznb	1482543995	Stop using it right now. Turn it off and put it in a bag of rice overnight. The rice will absorb any residual moisture that won't drop out on its own.	cb526	t3_5k0gxl
t3_5k0gxl	t1_dbkgd58	1482546322	Rice will not magically fix electronics. Once corrosion shows up on the PCB, your phone will not function until you clean that off or replace the IC or capacitor.

t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbms3w3	1482721266	Hi, me again! I've just had my battery replaced today (27th December). Using the app Battery Life (which I was using before for reference) it is reporting a full capacity battery. I am at 67% at the time of writing this. I plan on letting my phone die today so will see how it lasts after a full cycle.   By the way it was of $0 cost to myself as they said since they couldn't identify the problem they would replace it for free.	kensaiD2591	t1_dbgqmmg
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbmuchr	1482725311	Thanks for that. For the time being, I've found that putting it on low battery mode all day makes it much more stable.  Battery % still means nothing but it works for now.  I may go to the store and see what they can do.	defroach84	t1_dbms3w3
t3_5ivpsq	t1_dbn2xca	1482747810	Yeah it's well worth it. It's been 8 hours now since I got my phone back. It's gone down from 68% to 35%. Significantly better. It's nice to have my phone back again.	kensaiD2591	t1_dbmuchr

I really enjoy it, I have something like 52 unique brews and it's fun to look back and the great and not so great beers you've had.   Also, Temple Run 2 is still fun if anyone was wondering.

t3_5kjdrf	t1_dbod6xm	1482843471	Agree with fortean.  That seems pretty high.  I can get that easy $350 CDN, so you should be able to find it for $275 or so.  You also should factor another $100 for a new battery.  If you want to spend that much go for a 6s.	Coompa	t3_5kjdrf

t3_5kjdrf	t1_dbodimz	1482844384	I missed the "new" on the post. Personally, I wouldn't buy a two year old phone, but I cannot argue that it's definitely a very capable phone, and will be for at least a couple of years.  I'd go for a refurbished 6s at that price, quite frankly.	fortean	t1_dboddsc
t3_5kjdrf	t1_dbodtf5	1482845186	Just sold my near mint 64gb 6+ the other day for $400 with accessories. So of course I think that price for a new is pretty good. Lol.	oOMavrikOo	t3_5kjdrf

t3_5kjlyc	t1_dboh5w6	1482852117	Yep! It'll tell you it's done syncing when the media items aren't done.   I can't tell if it's a bug, or if they did it on purpose.

t3_5kjdrf	t1_dbosqq1	1482868108	I had an iPhone 6 on T Mobile from April through October and then switched to the 7. Didn't notice a speed or availability difference, and I stream/browse a lot.	iPhoid	t1_dboe28f
t3_5kjdrf	t1_dbou9sx	1482870158	No. I wouldn't go anything older than 6s at this point. 6s was a huge huge jump in performance, and it has 2GB of RAM as opposed to 1GB with the iPhone 6, which just isn't enough. I mean, iPhone 5, 5c, 5s, 6, and 6+ all had 1GB and they all have RAM management issues. RAM is usually what cuts off old devices from getting newer iOS updates.  And did I mention the A9 chip in the 6s (vs A8 in 6) is a beast? The A9 is a year old and it still crushes all the competition. The A8 is pretty similar to A7, which is what's in the iPhone 5s... 5s will drop support in a couple years (tops). A8 devices will follow suit very shortly after if it doesn't happen at the same time as A7 devices.  TL;DR: Don't buy. iPhone 6 is just a larger iPhone 5s. Support will probably be dropped sooner than you think.	uncertain-ithink	t3_5kjdrf
t3_5kjdrf	t1_dbov2p1	1482871227	The bigger screen is all the difference between the two. It's just as fast.     Well...a faster CPU... But you can do just as much on both phones. The big screen doesn't do much good other than movies and some games. Other than that it just big and it's a pain to keep in your pocket.	limbo111	t1_dbopfia
t3_5kjdrf	t1_dbovue1	1482872247	Yes, it is worth it. I had mine 2 months ago BRAND NEW i6 and really it is worth it. I even searched the Serial number and it was manufactured 7 months ago, iOS10 runs great and the white box have (For some reason) the new floral design and I think they are somehow better than the ones with the all white boxes (bent gate and other stuff) Even thou if you like to have the latest and greatest you wouldn't be taking this model into account.  Many people in the sub will tell you to take other models and they have their reasons, but to be honest, I compared my 6 with a friends SE and man for me it's pretty much the same thing, yeah I mean maybe the apps opens 2 secs faster and stuff, but it is the same thing just with a larger Screen, it's up to you decide.	omegaskate	t3_5kjdrf
t3_5kjdrf	t1_dbox59q	1482874018	Larger phones moonlight as GPS units, as eBook readers, and anything else that could be served with a separate device but people don't want to carry multiple things.	RuoDaeR	t1_dbogyxp
t3_5kjdrf	t1_dbox5as	1482874019	It also has only 1gb of RAM which will make it obsolete sooner rather than later, and is about half as fast as the latest iphone. If you already have a 6 there definitely isn't a real reason to upgrade unless you want to, but buying that thing new two years after it launched? Sorry, I don't think it makes sense.	fortean	t1_dbox1ir
t3_5kjdrf	t1_dboxgb0	1482874441	Saying it doesn't make sense is a blanket statement that doesn't consider the price and/or things about the new phone someone might hate, like requiring a dongle for the headphones.	RuoDaeR	t1_dbox5as
t3_5kjdrf	t1_dboxxwr	1482875107	Of course it does consider the price, a 2 year old phone for $420? Ridiculous.  And let's stop with the dongle, the fucking dongle is included in the package...   Buying the 6 today, **new**, is not something that I would do. If you want to buy it, please, go ahead and do.	fortean	t1_dboxgb0

t3_5kjdrf	t1_dbp1pnq	1482880352	The dongle is a draw back for many people, myself included, and I included it as my overall point of newer not always being better.  I always lose dongles, and honestly, Apple doesn't need to make their phones any thinner.  They're thin enough.  Make them actually thicker and add battery capacity, that's what people want.	RuoDaeR	t1_dboxxwr
t3_5kjdrf	t1_dbp3ywr	1482883564	No. Shitty battery, old processor... the only good thing about it is the storage. You're better off spending your money on a OnePlus 3 or one of the newer iPhones for that kind of price.	dinosaur_friend	t3_5kjdrf
t3_5kjdrf	t1_dbp4rsj	1482884757	&gt; Buying the 6 today, new, is not something that I would do.  Same here.  I went and picked up a used 6 today instead. Only came to around £240 with store vouchers and my friend's employee discount factored in for a space grey 64GB. I wouldn't buy this phone new, but it's still a great phone and I love it.

t3_5kjdrf	t1_dbp6vgo	1482887910	I personally would stay away from the 6 and 6+. Those "Touch disease" issues are for real. I work at a Sprint store and have seen waaay too many of them come in with the unresponsive touch issue/grey bar at the top. I'd Go with 6s, and even they are kinda iffy with the battery issues that are starting to show up. Seen many of them come in as well with batt issues (shutting down at 30-20%) and they don't show up as being covered in apples repair program.	ajbkid	t3_5kjdrf

t3_5kjdrf	t1_dbpgovs	1482903278	If you've never had an iPhone before, the 6 would be a great start. It'll last you a couple years, maybe 3. And if you've never had an iphone before, you won't notice how slow it is compared to newer models. I have a 6 and although it's slow sometimes it works perfectly fine and the only reason I may upgrade in the future is to get the plus size.	smushednoodle	t3_5kjdrf

t3_5kt6oe	t1_dbql5cc	1482974036	I removed the screen protector after I noticed something was wrong, so it's not the screen protector that's stained. Unfortunately I think I had a poor quality replacement and that's why it's never happened until now :(	preciouspurple	t1_dbqj3ls

t3_5kt6oe	t1_dbqmc3m	1482975794	No, /u/mistermagicman is absolutely right.

t3_5kt6oe	t1_dbqmcal	1482975802	It's true, but it doesn't sound like OP's problem. Since they said they can only see it when the phone is on that more than likely means they got moisture inside of their phone somehow.	smushednoodle	t1_dbqm01s

I can almost fit it in my Ram Mount without removing it.  (Ram mounts are tighter than the skin on a Jimmy Dean sausage.)  lol  It provides no drop absorption though.  Just keeps the phone from getting scratched.  It's nice that it makes my white phone look black too.

t3_5kt6oe	t1_dbqvsl7	1482990507	https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht207123  &gt; Your iPhone has a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic—oil repellant—coating. This coating wears over time with normal use. Cleaning products and abrasive materials will further diminish the coating and might scratch your iPhone.  Of course, I can't say for sure that alcohol will rub it off. Or perhaps, if you do it thoroughly, you tend to completely rub it off on the first go. But I'd stick to water for dedicated screen cleaning sprays.	mistermagicman	t1_dbqm01s

They gave me some pre-memorized line about how the replacement phone isn't refurbished - it's remanufactured, with a new screen and new outer case, but the insides might have been pre-existing (I don't remember her exact wording). In my head, I was like "so... refurbished", but I didn't feel like arguing.  Masters of marketing and spin :)	LaymanLab	t3_5kzb87
t3_5kzb87	t1_dbrvuew	1483053524	Most people aren't going to care that the inside of their phone was used before, especially if it passes Apple's standards.	BrownsFanZ	t1_dbrvir1
t3_5kzb87	t1_dbrwmh4	1483054626	It depends on what they have in stock. It is never guaranteed a new iPhone.	Mrpornogoregrinder	t1_dbrsaju
t3_5kzb87	t1_dbrxiqy	1483055878	Not true.   From a friend who is a former Genius Bar Employee, here is what he told me.   All the retail iPhone have a model number starting with M. My ATT version iphone 7 model is MN9H2LL. If the phone gets defective and needs to be replaced, it will be replaced by NN9H2LL Where "N" denotes the service units unless it is within 14 days of purchase from Apple Store where they will replace it with a brand new retail model. Any iphone bought from bestbuy, verizon, att, tmo, sprint stores will be replaced with service unit no matter how many days have passed since purchase.   When a new iphone is introduced and goes into production, Apple manufactures service units along with retail units because they know that certain new phones will become defective within days/weeks of being used. Apple store would usually receive batch of service units within days of a new iphone model launching so there is no way those are refurbished.   So the service units can be both new or refurbished depending on time of the production/demand.   As an employee looking at the white box containing the service unit they have no idea of knowing.	nayabkl	t1_dbrrl5i
t3_5kzb87	t1_dbryj58	1483057319	Most likely a refurb, but Apple is one of the few companies where that's not necessarily a bad thing. Refurbs undergo way more testing than the factory devices to ensure that they actually work, everything is essentially a new part minus the motherboard, and a few other parts i can't remember, but it is essentially a new device on the surface.	yungfucky	t3_5kzb87

t3_5kzb87	t1_dbs12gb	1483060973	Apple will never give you a "used" phone. It is always either new or "as good as new." I've probably traded out a dozen products over the years with Apple, and the device I was given was always fantastic.  If you want an actual used device, go through your carrier and have their insurance company send you another device. Half the time those have fake, non-Apple screens, with scratches and partially used batteries with liquid damage. Once that happens to you, you'll realize that Apple's replacements are a godsend.  And don't bother asking the Apple employee if you're getting a new or "like new" device because they literally do not know. It's whatever is in the box that the shipping depot sends to them.	cocobandicoot	t1_dbrz717

I am currently using a Lifeproof nuud, so the screen could get scratched, but I don't carry it in my pocket with keys or change. The Lifeproof cases are waterproof and much lower profile than the Otterbox. BTW Otterbox and Lifeproof are the same company. I camp a lot and go four-wheeling. The extra cost of the case has saved me a couple grand in replacement Iphones.	mreid74	t3_5kwh1r

Why should they give you a brand new one in return.  ( cell carries too not just apple).   If your phone is brand new I.e. within it's return period sure then you get another new one.

t3_5l79n7	t1_dbughko	1483219157	This is just a strategy used by telemarketers.  In the old days (like, a couple of years ago), telemarketers would make their mass numbers of calls, but the calling phone number showed up as either Unknown, as an 800 number, or as some other long distance number.  Then people got smart.  They noticed that all of their friend's or family's numbers showed up normally, and all of these Unknown / 800 / weird area code phone calls were telemarketers, so they started letting those go to voicemail.  Then telemarketers got smart, and they got spoofing technology.  They started spoofing their phone numbers so that the area codes matched the area codes of the target.  Now people just saw they were getting a call from someone in their city, and they'd answer it.  Then people got smart.  They started relying more heavily on their built-in phone contact list and only taking calls from people they knew.  They also noticed that, even if the area code seemed to be from their city, they often could tell by the prefix (if the phone number 206-555-1234, the prefix is the 555) whether or not it was likely to be real, or from what part of the city the caller was from.  This is because historically, the 3-digit prefixes were assigned to different parts of the city for landlines, or they were assigned to specific cell phone carriers.  This meant your neighbours had the same prefix as you, or people using the same cell phone carrier might have the same prefix as you.  Then telemarketers got smart.  Instead of just spoofing the number to match the area code of the target, they spoofed it so that their number matches the area code and first three digits of your phone number.   For example, if your phone number is 206-555-0011, they would spoof theirs as 206-555-2937.  Now it looks like a call coming from your own city, and probably from your own area.  Also, the phone number looks familiar to you, because it's so similar to your own.  So you answer it.  Here's where we now get weird "callback" calls.  Say your number is 206-555-0011, and mine is 206-555-2937.  When they called my number, they matched my area code and prefix (206-555-xxxx), then randomly filled in the last four digits.  Let's say that during my call, they randomly filled in the xxxx with 0011 (which is your phone number).  I missed the call, and I call you back, saying "You just called me, what do you want?".  This happens quite often, given the huge number of calls they make.  And every time they make a call with a spoofed number, there's a good chance that the spoofed number actually belongs to someone, who may then get one of these confusing callback calls.  At this point, I've completely stopped answering calls where the area code and prefix are the same as my number.  50% of the time it's a telemarketer.  50% of the time it's someone returning the call of a telemarketer who wants to know why I called them when I didn't.  I don't know anyone with the same area code &amp; prefix as my number, and if I did, I'd put them in my phone's contact list, and their name would come up.  If it is actually a legitimate call (and it never has been), they'll leave a voicemail and I'll call them back within a minute or two.  I don't think you can do much about these calls.  VOIP lines are cheap and don't incur long distance charges.  Also,labor is cheap in many developing countries.  Chances are, they're calling from one of these countries, and your local laws don't apply to them.	NotSoSeri0us	t3_5l79n7
t3_5l79n7	t1_dbugjyy	1483219255	It's just scam telemarketers using a robocall and they spoof the caller ID with local area phone numbers to get you to pick up the phone. It's been happening for years.  They randomize what phone number they use when doing this so there's a chance they'll spoof your number.	hummuschips	t3_5l79n7

t3_5lbq2m	t1_dbugwq1	1483219791	I think op wants to use his new Lightning earphones with the old headphone hole devices.   And if so it would be kind of stupid, but I suppose if enough people would be willing to pay for them someone would make them. But before you get to lusty about it op keep this in mind. Those Lightning earphones contain circuitry to convert the digital signal from the Lightning port into analog that the drivers need. That Lightning port also provides the power for that circuitry to run. So that adapter you want would also need to provide that power to your Lightning earbuds. Ad to that your new adapter would also consume power, to convert the analog signal from that little round analog hole into the digital signal that those new Lightning earphones need. So your adapter would need a spot for either a set of aaa batteries, a rechargeable battery pack, ar another little hole to plug a wall wart into. Add all of this together and you'll understand why I will never buy that adapter.	portnux	t1_dbuggqq

t3_5lhi8q	t1_dbvronz	1483311646	I haven't gotten that good of battery life it seems. It seems like for every 1 hour of usage, I lose 10% battery life. And for every hour of standby, I seem to lose about ~1% battery life.  My battery life is acceptable and seems good actually, but it's not amazing. Just trying to figure out if my usage is what other people get, or if I got a short stick battery.	PaulWog	t1_dbvpv32
t3_5lhi8q	t1_dbvszc6	1483313380	i usually get 10-14 hours of usage on a full charge, the battery life is amazing and fantastic as ever.	Chocolations	t3_5lhi8q
t3_5lhi8q	t1_dbvugcb	1483315350	I should add! I'm at 50% screen brightness.  Now at 43%.   4.5 hours of usage 21 hours of standby time (I believe standby time still incorporates usage time in the number, so usage of 1 hour would still add 1 hour of standby)  On airplane mode, wifi, sitting in a basement. Not sure if struggling wifi can worsen battery life much.	PaulWog	t3_5lhi8q
t3_5lhi8q	t1_dbvwxai	1483318847	&gt;My plus was at 100% at 6pm yesterday. It's 2pm on the next day, 20 hours later. I'm now at 52%. My usage is 3 hours and 23 minutes, and standby says about 20 hours. I have used safari for about an hour, Reddit app for half an hour, flashlight for 2 minutes, games for about 5 minutes, texting, 50 minutes of call time, 2 minutes of 4K video, and 40 pictures some with flash, and I've checked my phone every 15 minutes while awake.  so just to be clear. you have had your phone off the charger for 20+ hours and are complaining because it is at 52% with pretty typical/normal usage?  ...and you are unhappy with it or think it is poor battery life?	knockoutking	t3_5lhi8q
t3_5lhi8q	t1_dbvym9a	1483321386	i am on 10.2, on 10.1 i have noticed the battery life was not as good. 10.2 might have fixed it! also on nightshift mode and screen brightness is at automatic. 90% of my phone is on wifi, unless I'm driving then its on LTE	Eyad123	t1_dbvt3n7
t3_5lhi8q	t1_dbvz89v	1483322274	I am requesting respectfully that you do not come in here just to post derogatory comments. I don't appreciate it one bit.  I am checking to see how other users of the iPhone 7 Plus are doing for battery life. Some have purported using the iPhone even more and getting better battery life, so I want to see various other accounts to get different accounts.  It seems that my iPhone drains 10% battery life per hour while the screen is on at ~45%, almost regardless of what I do with it. I am not sure how that compares. Not using my phone and preserving battery life certainly isn't that impressive, just nice.	PaulWog	t1_dbvwxai

t3_5lhi8q	t1_dbw4f9g	1483330060	No for sure it's good! But I want to know if it's on par with the other 7 Pluses.  I have a stalker freak who downvotes everything I do. He has been following me ever since I reported some crazy posts he made in another Reddit thread.  Idk how people purport having the screen on for an hour and losing 3-5% battery life and saying the screen is at 50%+. I can't get better than 10% per hour with the screen on (granted I can't do lowest brightness it's just too dim).	PaulWog	t1_dbw3xxo
t3_5lhi8q	t1_dbw6hu5	1483333220	Hmm I think I have about the same usage and standby as you, yesterday. I had about 53% battery left with maybe 6-7 hours of usage, and 12-15 hours of standby. Also on 10.2 and just got this phone a week ago. Same as you with 90% of the time on wifi. I feel like the battery is not living up to what was advertised. I use Reddit, Snapchat and safari heavily but all on wifi.	bunnae	t1_dbvym9a

t3_5lo1jy	t1_dbx7d1a	1483400168	Nice, the only thing that stopped me from one of those is the lack of protection on the bottom. I got a new case today too, Magpul Field case in OD Green, love it so far.	sglville	t3_5lo1jy

t3_5lo1jy	t1_dbx93zz	1483402524	It's really stylish. I like it and I'm a big fan of worn leather. I ALMOST got the saddle brown one but my favorite color is blue. And I have a White/Grey 6. The dark on white just looks classy IMO.	Jackson530	t1_dbx81zu

t3_5lo1jy	t1_dbx9u42	1483403498	Yeah. I think when I upgrade this year, I'm gonna stick with this trend and get one for that phone too.   Some cases now a days look very...Gotty or ugly.

t3_5lo1jy	t1_dbxg9nq	1483411783	I'm glad you like it! I splurged and bought a midnight blue one for my last iPhone, and I really liked it. When I got my iPhone 7 Plus, I couldn't justify spending $50 again on one, so I got a cheap clear case. While decent, I realized I missed the elegant look and feel of the leather case. Tonight I was lucky and found a Sea Blue (the color that I wanted) one at Best Buy with some minor scratches on it (that will rub out over time anyway) that was marked down to a little under $33. I couldn't resist buying it and am greatly enjoying having one again!	appleaf	t3_5lo1jy
t3_5lo1jy	t1_dbxh1qn	1483412833	Unfortunately, Apple continues to screw over the millions of iPhone SE customers by not releasing the full range of leather cases available for the other iPhones. Until recently, they had only released a very dark blue and a black, which were almost indistinguishable in most lights; for Christmas they released a red one.	mojosam	t3_5lo1jy

t3_5lo1jy	t1_dbxjfjm	1483416121	The leather is also cheaper than most dollar store wallets. For the cost I have never felt so ripped off.   That said, it's still protecting my phone until I find something better.	croy_00	t1_dbx7d1a
t3_5lo1jy	t1_dbxjjgr	1483416275	Not really. Had that one for 6 and eventually the case was close to being black after a year. Eventually got brown for 6s it was it age really well. Had to get it again for the 7.	ziggie216	t1_dbx81zu

t3_5lo1jy	t1_dbxm8k6	1483420366	I have the Storm Grey on my rose gold phone, and I love the color combo. I also just love the way the phone feels in my hands. It adds an indistinguishable amount of weight, and gives a nice amount of grip without being slippery. I also love the way that it's wearing so far.  I don't drop my phone too much, so I don't need anymore protection than this, and I just think the case looks beautiful on the phone.	kerintheam	t3_5lo1jy
t3_5lo1jy	t1_dbxmj1i	1483420837	Oh I'm not talking about its durability. What I am saying is it is the cheapest feeling leather I have ever felt on a product not sold at a night market in Hong Kong.	croy_00	t1_dbxlp5g

t3_5lo1jy	t1_dby0w59	1483455350	&gt;  Doesn't age that well.  I had a brown leather one for my iPhone 6S. I thought it was hideous after 3 months, but being the student I am I opted to just live with it. I only found that I really liked how it turned out once I passed the 7 or 8 month mark. Then I was like, wow this actually looks pretty good. The darker brown was more all over and not just on the corners.   For my iPhone 7 I bought a red silicon one, but it's too grippy and annoying because when I take it out of my pocket, it turns the pocket inside out. This makes it really hard to put back in since turning it back regular I have to do with my other hand because just putting in the phone won't do it..   I'm thinking of going brown leather case for it again but not sure. I've heard the volume buttons are hard to use with the leather one because of some plastic thing which presses both, but not sure if what I've heard is true.	I-Made-You-Read-This	t1_dbx7kek
t3_5lo1jy	t1_dby2qtd	1483458099	From my personal experience I can tell you that the buttons are perfect: built out of some metal and they feel good when you press them. Just like pressing the ones on your iPhone itself.   Maybe I should get along with the look of the case at the moment and wait what it will look like in a few months.

t3_5m05x1	t1_dbzr5iq	1483549532	Do you have an Apple Music or iTunes Match subscription? If so, it might be that most of your songs are in the cloud and only a handful of your songs are stored locally. There may be something preventing the rest of your songs from streaming/downloading. (such as having cellular data disabled for the Music app)	ZippoS	t3_5m05x1
t3_5m05x1	t1_dbzuq96	1483553685	That was it! Turning on cellular data in music app on the settings fixed it. Thanks! Question - have u now added to my phone's memory load by enabling this?	CeilingUnlimited	t1_dbzr5iq
t3_5m05x1	t1_dbzw0vw	1483555131	If by memory load you're talking about RAM, no it won't. However, if you've re-enabled cellular data for the Music app, keep in mind that streaming music over cellular can eat up a data plan pretty quickly (especially if you have a small plan).  It will use some storage space as you continue to play music. My understanding is that the music app keeps a cache of streamed tracks, but that cache is erased as needed. It won't completely fill up your storage (or, at least, it *shouldn't*)  I have my entire music collection (8500+ songs) uploaded and available through iTunes Match, but I have a separate playlist with my favourite/new songs (about 580) that I use for when I'm driving. I specifically have that playlist *downloaded* onto the phone.  To download a playlist, browse to a playlist in the Music app and click the icon that's [a cloud with a downward arrow](https://i.imgur.com/sLiywc9.png) at the very top of the list. This will store those songs locally. That way, when they play, they don't use any of your data plan. You can also download individual songs. Obviously, only do this over WiFi lest you chew through your data plan.  So, when I'm out and about, I listen to my car playlist and don't use extra data. When I'm on WiFi, I can play any song from my library without worry.	ZippoS	t1_dbzuq96

t3_5m0zll	t1_dc0dfsn	1483574962	Your skin is no where near glass smooth. Glossy provides more possible contact area. Skin is made up of scales which provide friction.

t3_5m0zll	t1_dc0epfd	1483576571	My example was simply an analogy. I was not saying that our skin was like glass or sandpaper. Our skin is similar to the rubber of the eraser. The very smooth plastic pods are relatively similar to glass.    Also, I don't believe that any change in surface texture would have a significant effect on the friction of our little air-pods. Mine are held in firmly by their placement inside of my ear and gravity. Matte finish would not cause them to fall out.   Edit: Phone screens are smooth so that our fingers glide across them. The backs of our phones are textured (often matte) so that they don't glide out of our hands.	PointlessPankcake	t1_dc0dfsn

It's the same principle as racing tires -- more contact with a surface gives more friction, assuming one or both surfaces are pliable.  Your skin is pliable.  See [Gruber's review](https://daringfireball.net/2016/09/iphone_7_jet_black_vs_black) of the Jet Black iPhone, for example.

t3_5m0zll	t1_dc19jah	1483631661	Its not as clear cut as what people are making it out to be ITT. The screen is slippery and perfectly smooth. More so than the perfectly smooth back of the Jet Black iPhone. Sandpaper isn't smooth at all and I think most would agree that sandpaper has grip.   Sometimes smooth will have a tacky feel because of the moisture in your skin. Aluminum doesn't really feel tacky. It has more to do with the material than the gloss vs matte, but those do come into play.	Whit3W0lf	t1_dc0cmxw

t3_5m0zll	t1_dc1diqo	1483636303	The properties completely change when water is involved. It's the reason why racing slicks in his example are not allowed for road use on everyday cars. Because as soon as water is on the road the tires hydroplane very easily having very little traction. That's because you don't have recessed gaps in the texture of the tires for the water to be pushed into. But when there is no water involved to cause a layer between the tires and the road or in your case a foot and pool tile greater surface area does mean greater grip/traction.

t3_5m0zll	t1_dc1fkea	1483638612	But not enough moisture to cause hydroplaning to occur. That occurs when the moisture/water etc.. create a gap between the surfaces preventing them from haunt full contact. When you are running along the deck of a pool and it has smooth tiles and you slip. You're not slipping on the tile exactly. You are slipping because the standing water is moving on top of the tile between your feet and that tile. Whenever there is enough moisture to cause this property to happen it becomes slippery. It just so happens that this occurs much more easily on a smooth surface because the water fills whatever micro texture there may be on a smooth surface with much less liquid required.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hydroplaning.svg  As for the clammy hands not sliding smoothly well then we aren't talking about hydro planning anymore. Your finger on glass not sliding smoothly is literally why the gloss iPhone 7 is less slippery than the matte version.	Extinctconcept2	t1_dc1do60
t3_5m74r6	t1_dc1i5cz	1483641492	After coming from Android, I used the SE for a few months and really liked it.  A few days ago, I started using a 6s. Yes, the innards are very similar, several things are different.  The touch screen seems better on the 6s.  Often, the SE didn't register touches.  Also, for whatever reason, the 6s seems just slightly faster.  For me, the SE was just a little small and hard to read in some instances.  Otherwise, the differences are the 3D touch (nice, but not essential), better front-facing camera (not a big deal to me), and brighter screen outside.  The SE battery is a little better and I loved it, but the 6s gets me through a whole day with plenty to spare. Oh, and the fingerprint sensor is upgraded on the 6s and noticeably faster.	gapost	t3_5m74r6

t3_5m74r6	t1_dc1mrar	1483646569	I never got the issue of having to delete and redo fingerprints with my iPhone 6. It worked pretty consistently, just slowly compared to iPhone 6s and newer.

You aren't arguing a point against what I am saying, you are just diving further into explanation of why smooth is slick, which is what I have maintained all along.  ITT, people are saying the matte phone is more slick because the surface is porous and that isn't the reason why. That's all I ever claimed.	Whit3W0lf	t1_dc1fkea

t3_5m74r6	t1_dc1nzia	1483647910	They most likely are not going to release a new "small" model this year and noone can guarantee they will next year. Mainly because the spec difference is not at noticable thus the cycle of upgrade is not so often. Personally I would go for 5S rather than SE due to price difference between two	Rubikh	t3_5m74r6
t3_5m74r6	t1_dc1onjl	1483648649	That doesn't really help OP as they were looking at a phone with a 4 inch screen. They could already buy the iPhone 7 if they were looking at something in the 5 inch range (4.7in but close enough)	MS49SF	t1_dc1hrp1
t3_5m74r6	t1_dc1p1ub	1483649079	I bought the SE just before Christmas - coming from a 6+ I thought it was going to go badly with a smaller screen, but now I understand what the SE fuss is about.   It's such a brilliant phone - best phone I've ever owned in fact, and I'm not a casual user, I use it all day for work and play.   It's lightning fast for a start. The design is a massive improvement to the 6/7 which never felt comfortable in my hands (something I noticed even more after switching). The size, which I thought would be the biggest issue, is soooooo much better (for me at least, and I'm a large man) and one-handed use is absolutely brilliant for using the phone efficiently again. And the battery has been a real trooper, often lasting from one morning to the next evening! Never got that kind of mileage with the 6+. And it's so nice to hold to my ear as, you know, a phone.  Like you, I was worried about picking up a phone that 'might' be near the end of its cycle and almost went for the 7 with no headphone jack (which I use all the time), force touch (don't care) and 2nd-gen TouchID (still don't care), but after a bit of thinking I realised the SE is almost half the price of the 7 (at least here in the UK) and it's got literally everything I want on my iPhone.   And now I have it, I wish I had done it sooner and not stuck it out with the 6+, which now in comparison looks and feels like a fat old tramp.   If they update it this year, so what? Sell your SE if it's worth upgrading and you won't be out much due to its already low price. If they don't upgrade it, you'll be glad you bought the SE.   If you wait around wondering whether to get a current model or a potentially upgraded model months down the line, you could be waiting forever.	tecfrigo	t3_5m74r6

t3_5m74r6	t1_dc2ishe	1483692300	I came from a 6s 16gb to an SE 64gb. Love the extra space. Performance is the same if not slightly better. Love the screen size. Love the battery, between 6-8 hours usage time every day. Only real con is to front camera, only 1.2mp but I dont really take selfies so doesn't bother me. Dont miss force touch as I rarely used it. Also dont miss the fast finger print sensor as I like to view notifications before unlocking the phone. Price is also great. Great build quality.	jnvdh06	t3_5m74r6

t3_5m74r6	t1_dc3tbik	1483760210	I bought the SE over a month ago because my 6 died, it's the best phone I've bought! I thought coming from the 6 would be a negative, but after a whole day of use I got used to the screen. It's seriously fast and smooth with that A9 Chip, even faster than the 7! The 12MP camera is phenomenal and battery life is WAY better than the 6, for me. If size isn't a problem, you should buy it!	gabrielquilez	t3_5m74r6
t3_5miag9	t1_dc3tdlb	1483760302	Coming from a 5" Android and trying the iOS waters, 4" is just too small to type comfortably (and more important) accurately on. It's great hardware tho, good camera. Too bad app store purchases can't be transferred between worlds	enjoyitalready	t3_5miag9

t3_5miag9	t1_dc3uuz9	1483762655	Yeah , when I first got my phone my dad had been rocking the 5s for 3 years. Then he held my phone and said "Oh you got a 5s too?" Then I explained it was the same thing except upgraded parts. Within one month he got his own se :)	Skhatty	t1_dc3um2v
t3_5miag9	t1_dc3vmoo	1483763949	I came from an LG G4, and got used to the screen size within the first day even though my G4 is a 5.5" phone while my SE is 4".   This is my first ever iPhone, and if they might realease another SE in 2018, I think this is the lineup of iPhones I'll be sticking with.   The price is just right, I was basically giving iOS a try since I've never owned an iOS device before, so for an experiment of a device, I'll say it was worth the change. I'm not saying I won't go back to android, but android has been stagnant when it comes to new features and It just gets more battery consuming after every major update despite their tries in fixing things such as Doze, I gave up on that concept.   The size too is another thing I love. Apple isn't into the resolution game when it comes to the specs of the screen, and that's good! The screen consumes lesser battery life, even though it has a smaller battery, the overall battery life is still better than those with more pixels and bigger battery capacity.  Lastly, I love the battery capacity. Android users have this mindset that QuickCharge and bigger capacity means better battery life, and I hated how the market was going that way. Having a bigger battery might mean that you have a bigger capacity at first, but a few months down the road, due to deteoration, it might just be 70% useful while a smaller battery might still be capable of holding a charge of 85%. QuickCharge might fix the issue of slow charging, but that too deteorates the battery faster making the more unstable. How about a smaller battery, a smaller phone and less charging and your battery won't even deteorate that fast?   I guess you could count me an SE fanboy!  TL;DR. This is my first iPhone, and there's a lot of things Apple did right about this phone that just makes me want to wait for the the next SE in 2018 than grabbing the 7 instead. So you could count me as an SE fanboy.	luqman_sha	t3_5miag9
t3_5miag9	t1_dc40fbu	1483773140	Loving my SE! I feel like I respond to every one of these threads. I've always loved the 5/5S design and figured it was a matter of time before I picked this up. I really hope Apple can update this phone and keep it at the same screen size.	ThatsRRtoYou	t3_5miag9
t3_5miag9	t1_dc44y32	1483786672	Consider me part of the club lol I think if they found a way to change up the aesthetics a little bit and maintain the weight by making it incredibly durable (drop wise) as well as making it water resistant it would be the perfect phone (for me)	CurryGettinSpicy	t3_5miag9
t3_5miag9	t1_dc45bvo	1483787993	I like the SE for similar reasons as to why I liked the 5C so much, they really fill the same market. I got both when they came out because they had the things I wanted and omitted a lot of the features I didn't care about for a fair price drop	ms6615	t3_5miag9

Edit2: I posted this because, in my opinion, the juxtaposition of the two widgets as well as the "Snow, 0% chance of snow" were both funny and I wanted to share it, thinking it was a stupid bug or something. I didn't intend for there to be such a dire mood in the comments regarding it.   I know people are touchy right now about public opinion in Apple and everything but please, relax. Some of these comments are so angry. It was all in jest.	FunkyGradStudent	t3_5mljxg

t3_5miag9	t1_dc4gl4u	1483811140	I love that it fits in every pocket I have. It's so practical. I came from an LG G3, and honestly, while the screen was charming bc of the resolution and size, I could see phone companies are missing out on the meaning of the word "mobile". It was huge, it didn't fit anywhere and it wasn't that comfortable to carry around. SE is the complete opposite, even hardware-wise. iOS is becoming better in every update, while Android... My 1-year-old phone suffered when Lollipop came even with its ~*killer*~ specs.	Archandroids	t3_5miag9
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4gvz3	1483811570	I honestly don't know where it pulls its data. But I do know is it's extremely accurate down to the minute. It'll notify you if rain or snow or whatever is starting soon, and how long it'll last, then notify you when it's about to stop, which is my favorite feature about it.   The widget isn't customizable, but if you hit "show more" the widget expands and shows a really neat precipitation graph showing you quickly how much precipitation will happen over the hour and to what degree, as well as the forecast for the next few days.   It's pretty handy I'd say. Only fault is I think the user interface of the app isn't very good. But it's saved my butt a few times, while the Weather app had no clue anything was happening.

t3_5miag9	t1_dc4hcop	1483812212	the only problem I have is my pocket feels so empty after having a larger android phone	alexkalinin	t3_5miag9
t3_5miag9	t1_dc4hxbk	1483812996	Me, I love the device! Not yet completely getting used to iOS but the phone is great	paulr85mi	t3_5miag9
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4isei	1483814148	As a Dark Sky user myself, and being rurally based, I can confirm what /u/FunkyGradStudent says. Dark Sky is very accurate and I find the app to be one of the better purchases I've made. The UI isn't the most clean looking or visually attractive but it's by no means ugly or bad, it's just...rustic?   I'd personally recommend it if you're looking to spend money on a weather app, I was hesitant myself but I'm happy I made that purchase.	examinati0n	t1_dc4g65s
t3_5miag9	t1_dc4ivud	1483814275	I had the SE for a couple of weeks and then returned it. The form factor was awesome and battery too on 9.3.3. Then I upgraded to 10.2 and it made the battery worse. Did anybody else experience the battery issues?	srikanthdude	t3_5miag9
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4leza	1483817707	Well Apple uses Weather.com for info, so Apple doesn't have control over that.	crisss1205	t1_dc4fqdz
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4llva	1483817971	Except for the issue that the Dark Sky watch complication says it's 50° out when it's 22° and snowing.	Jig5	t3_5mljxg
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4npu2	1483820868	You miss the point. The app says it's snowing, with 0% chance of snow.   Even weather.com doesn't say or do things like that. It has to be a bug in the app itself.	FunkyGradStudent	t1_dc4leza
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4nxap	1483821155	THanks for the reply, so far I'm enjoying it, already received accurate rain notifications, so I'm pleased, phone will probably blow up the next couple days, gonna have a shit storm😐.	rwon512	t3_5mljxg
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4ozys	1483822652	I fail to understand why people pay so much attention to weather forecasts. In July our firm went on a trip to Copenhagen, one forecast said it would be sunny for the weekend, another said cloudy with rain. In the end it was belting hot during the days with thunderstorms in the night.	Stazalicious	t3_5mljxg
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4pxh4	1483823945	I always heard great things about dark sky, but never purchased it due to the dissuading UI. Although recently I heard about partly sunny, which is based off of dark sky, with all the features of dark sky - but with a revamped, minimalistic UI. I absolutely love it, and would encourage everyone to try it out. It's well worth the money in my opinion.	harrisonrustay	t3_5mljxg
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4q09h	1483824051	Carrot Weather pulls from the Dark Sky database and is way more fun imo.	Aurick	t1_dc4g65s
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4qpbs	1483824979	Let me guess, if this is a bug we need to wait for a iOS OTA for a fix? I wonder why Apple cannot just update their stock app through the app store.	plee82	t3_5mljxg
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4qtqa	1483825140	I just gotta say, I really enjoyed this story	philonrapist	t1_dc4pxh4
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4s90n	1483826925	Or maybe the Weather API is returning some weird values.   It has to display that data from somewhere.	crisss1205	t1_dc4npu2
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4sak1	1483826979	Works fine for me. Shows there is a 30% chance of snow.	crisss1205	t1_dc4qpbs
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4sik8	1483827250	If there's nothing wrong with the data, the issue is obviously with the interpretation and presentation.	NotLawrence	t1_dc4s90n
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4sjef	1483827282	Weather Line uses Dark Sky and is much better IMO. Apple just featured it again actually.	notchrysostom	t1_dc4pxh4
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4sn7b	1483827412	Also try out dark sky's website both on iOS and macOS. It's nice!	TestFlightBeta	t1_dc4pxh4
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4spzt	1483827514	Weather.com doesn't dog food their own APIs. It's most likely an issue with their data coming in rather than iOS displaying it as such.	admiralwaffles	t1_dc4npu2
t3_5miag9	t1_dc4t191	1483827919	Just picked it up last night. I like it so much better than my iPhone 5	Jjwllms	t3_5miag9
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4t92f	1483828203	Exactly, but you don't know if something is wrong with the data, and since OP blurred it out, we can't even look it up.   Mine works fine. Currently snowing. Showing a 30% chance of snow.	crisss1205	t1_dc4sik8
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4thbx	1483828503	Recently switched to dark sky. Gotta say I'm disappointed. Said we'd have snow at noon while weather channel said 7. No snow all night till 7. They also said we'd have 5-9 inches. Only 3 fell. 🙄	_lolfuckyou	t1_dc4ozys
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4tokx	1483828763	It's Yahoo weather. Jesus people. Stop finding shit to bitch about.	sk1wbw	t3_5mljxg
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4tv6q	1483829003	Yesterday in NC, dark sky kept upping the forecast for snow from 7"-11", to by the end of the day 14"-21". We ended up with maybe 2"-3"...	shamansanchez	t1_dc4thbx
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4txsr	1483829098	The apple weather app (as well as the default Google uses. It's not just Apple.) seems to use a weather station 40km away and can be off by quite a few degrees. Bit odd considering I'm in a city with &gt; 100,000 people and an actual weather station, yet it ignores that data for a small town instead.	MonkeysLikeBanana	t3_5mljxg
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4u4od	1483829354	Found the Californian.  When you live in a place that snows, or gets bad weather in general, weather apps become a super big deal.  Source: Moved from CA to NC. Learned to give a shit about the weather. (Moved before apps were a thing. So not sure how much I'd have used a weather app in CA. Don't really pay much attention to them when I visit, though.)	dragontology	t1_dc4tokx
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4umms	1483830013	I've tried Dark Sky several times and it's consistently inaccurate in my region.	leafleap	t1_dc4g65s
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4uxwp	1483830413	Lol, you do realize you must live in a different area than OP, right?	DJ-Salinger	t1_dc4sak1
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4uzei	1483830465	It's actually the weather channel. Check the bottom left of the weather app	Falkedup	t1_dc4tokx
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4v2bz	1483830569	Atlanta here. I got hit in the feels too. 😭😂	_lolfuckyou	t1_dc4tv6q
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4veu0	1483831040	Currently snowing, 30% chance of snow isn't too great either.   In any case, could be the data or the app, I really have no idea. I just saw the juxtaposition of my two widgets and found it funny and worth sharing.  My Weather app had for a few days predicted today's forecast as a snowflake on the app, so I highly doubt the 0% chance of snow was meant to be there.	FunkyGradStudent	t1_dc4t92f
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4vhih	1483831141	Haha. Well, it was a guess. You know, the whole "found the" meme. No? Stick around some. Anyway, you seem to not care a whole lot about weather, so it's a safe bet you live where it doesn't matter much. Like parts of California. Here in eastern NC... it's a bit more important.	dragontology	t1_dc4upay
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4vk0g	1483831234	One day I downloaded 5 or 6 different weather apps and took a screen shot of the forecast. Two said it would rain that day, and they were right. The rest were deleted. It only took a few more days and those two got deleted for similar issues. Sadly, I've found that no weather app works. I stick with the stock app and just never trust it.	gachzorge	t3_5mljxg
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4w6i3	1483832099	I find AerisPulse to be the most accurate for me. Plus it's only a buck.	balsam_pathos_ashtra	t1_dc4vk0g
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4wcqu	1483832342	I was born in Durham. Lived on the OBX for a year. I now live in Williamsburg Virginia. I have about 5 weather apps on my iPhone and every single one of them were reading the same all day. Snow. And more snow. Over a foot of it.   Blame Yahoo for bad readings on this app. Just wish people would fucking stop going out of their way to find something to bitch about apple over.	sk1wbw	t3_5mljxg
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4weu0	1483832419	That's why Dark Sky occupies the spot of Weather in my home screen and Apple Weather is dumped in the Crap 💩 folder.	Mystic_Decay	t3_5mljxg
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4wfo2	1483832450	Yeah I don't know why Yahoo came to mind. I think my brain is frozen. It's damn cold outside.	sk1wbw	t1_dc4uzei
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4xbtf	1483833669	I use Carrot Weather because Dark Sky isn't available in Canada, but I'd prefer to use Dark Sky. Carrot Weather doesn't have any notifications. That's one thing missing for me.	MarvelsBlackCat	t1_dc4q09h
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4xi34	1483833899	I fixed it by uninstalling the watch app and then the phone app and then reinstalling	oruspu_cocugu	t1_dc4llva
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4xmjn	1483834062	Dude even on the news when it's snowing they display the % chance it had of doing yo. It isn't worth worrying about. Your widget shows the snowflake meaning it's snowing. The data is obviously wrong on someone's part. Big deal.	lanetrain7	t1_dc4veu0
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4xu1a	1483834330	What, do you think Tim Cook is sitting there typing these in?	megablast	t1_dc4npu2
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4xytw	1483834497	My weather app is a hit or miss. Last night it was snowing and it said 15% of snow showers, it also said it was 45 degrees out (uh.. more like -2 out). Lol another time it was snowing and said it was snowing with the correct temperature.	frickxoff	t3_5mljxg
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4y0gc	1483834554	Does dark sky have push notifications for watches, advisories, and warnings? I've found Storm to be the best weather app around, both visually, and in accuracy (it's a wunderground app). My problem is storm doesn't push for watches, only warnings. After downloading almost all the free weather apps in the App Store, I've found only AccuWeather pushes watches.	Vtrossi	t1_dc4gvz3
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4ye7m	1483835051	Why don't you just uninstall the stock weather app?	ScaryRaebbit	t1_dc4weu0
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4yk56	1483835262	I have bought Dark Sky and Weather Line. They both have the problem where the widget is scrunched up/stacked on top/unreadable. Surely these two different apps can't have the same problem just because they use the same source. I just wish there was something like Weather Timeline on iOS.	ScaryRaebbit	t1_dc4sjef
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4yr4v	1483835518	Carrot Weather has notifications at least in the US. You have to turn them on in the app, not the Notification Center.	Aurick	t1_dc4xbtf
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4ywkr	1483835718	I love Dark Sky and have used it for a while now, but as a few others have said the UI isn't the nicest. However, I can't find a good alternative that also has a companion apple watch app and complication, which I really enjoy having. Then again, the apple watch complication is so often inaccurate that I'm not sure that it matters anyway, so I stick with Dark Sky unsure of whether or not I should really switch to something else.	BMFeciura	t3_5mljxg
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4z2u0	1483835946	&gt; Even weather.com doesn't say or do things like that.	NotLawrence	t1_dc4xuf4
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4zfek	1483836416	Darksky is very imprecise in my country, but apple weather is always top notch	Sichroteph	t3_5mljxg
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4zi7w	1483836517	I use Weather Underground and it's pretty darn good.  It crowd sources from local personal weather stations among other things.	Ezl	t1_dc4vk0g
t3_5ktg7s	t1_dc4zn9m	1483836697	OMG.  So much better!  I laid out 10 big ones and got a Titanium one that doesn't fool the phone into thinking you're listening to music.  :-) http://i.imgur.com/DIV9e1k.jpg  Feels sweet and acts like a little handling nub which keeps the phone more secure in the hand.  I got the Titaner one.  10 bucks included shipping from Asia!  :-)	Pavlovs_Doug	t3_5ktg7s
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc4zp9l	1483836772	Not sure in the specifics you mentioned, but in its notification settings it has Severe Weather alerts activated for government issued weather alerts and warnings.	FunkyGradStudent	t1_dc4y0gc
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc50dp3	1483837683	That's not my point. My point is that the app works fine, but the weather channel data may be wrong.	crisss1205	t1_dc4uxwp
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc50f8y	1483837742	Yeah, you can tell how often I use this app.  Frankly, it is boring to look at.	sk1wbw	t1_dc4zgev
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc50hrb	1483837837	Any idea why Dark Sky constantly is using the location ?  It's kinda annoying that the icon is on the top non stop.	AheadOfSchedule	t3_5mljxg
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc50wkl	1483838408	I don't think you understand how weather reports work.  The "Probability of Precipitation" (PoP) describes the chance of precipitation occurring ***at any point*** you select in the area.  PoP = C x A where "C" = the confidence that precipitation will occur somewhere in the forecast area, and where "A" = the percent of the area that will receive measureable precipitation, if it occurs at all.  If the forecaster knows precipitation is sure to occur ( confidence is **100%** ), he/she is expressing how much of the area will receive measurable rain. ( PoP = "C" x "A" or "**1**" times "**.4**" which equals .4 or 40%.)	crisss1205	t1_dc4veu0
t3_5miag9	t1_dc55fn2	1483844434	Idk I have a 2400 mah battery case so battery has never been a problem. I put my phone in airplane and battery mode during school and work.	Skhatty	t1_dc4ivud
t3_5miag9	t1_dc55hmx	1483844514	I know the feeling, I have a hefty battery case on it, so I always got some extra weight on it.	Skhatty	t1_dc4hcop
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc55kt6	1483844636	Their API would return whatever their website says. Is it really that hard to understand that the fault might be with the app?  If it's weather.com's API that's wrong, a lot of other weather apps would also have this issue.	NotLawrence	t1_dc55ccv
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc56x68	1483846424	Seems like most apps where the developers don't feel watches are important enough to merit a push notification.	Vtrossi	t1_dc4zp9l
t3_5mp7bb	t3_5mp7bb	1483851767	iPhone should have a 'hide contact' feature. You don't have to delete them but you don't have to be painfully reminded of them unless need be either.	bcxx143	-1
t3_5mp7bb	t1_dc5bh0d	1483853267	Good idea, another simple really is just cut and paste their info somewhere on the note app or on a google docs. Delete the contact from uour contact app and voila	L0veToReddit	t3_5mp7bb
t3_5mp7bb	t1_dc5c3jr	1483854403	...if their mere written name causes you pain, just delete them	ty509	t3_5mp7bb
t3_5mp7bb	t1_dc5dtls	1483857813	You could simply make a group for those contacts and untick it at contacts so those don't show up in any of iOS suggestions	ideaprison	t3_5mp7bb
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc5e7rj	1483858684	Not if there is a problem. You seem to know nothing.  It could be the app, it could be the API.	megablast	t1_dc55kt6
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc5emzt	1483859653	Yeah that didn't work in a city I visited. The app just wouldn't load at all. All other cities were fine... But I figured it wasn't worth it if it couldn't work everywhere.	gachzorge	t1_dc4zi7w
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc5enjz	1483859689	I won't pay for a weather app until I know for sure it will work.	gachzorge	t1_dc4w6i3
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc5ens2	1483859703	Unless weather.com is also reporting the same data, there is no problem. That's not how APIs work.    Are you a developer?	NotLawrence	t1_dc5e7rj
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc5esc3	1483860005	Don't be stupid, of it can be different data. You would expect it to be the same, and mostly it would bit it is not impossible for it to be different.	megablast	t1_dc5ens2
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc5etyf	1483860112	???   I legitimately tried to interpret that for a few minutes but I can't make out a consistent trail of logic there.     Edit: ok I think I'm getting it. No that's not how APIs work. Both the website and the API would be retrieving data from the same source. If they're different, there'd be more posts about how inaccurate the weather.com is since no third party app would match up to the website.     I'm going to sleep and I will no longer be interested in this discussion when I wake up since you don't seem to be a developer and I don't like to continue discussion that are from the previous day.	NotLawrence	t1_dc5esc3
t3_5mljxg	t1_dc5f6mi	1483860969	&gt; No that's not how APIs work. Both the website and the API would be retrieving data from the same source.

t3_5mp7bb	t1_dc5fy7a	1483863002	I agree. I have a huge number of contacts from 15-20 years ago that I don't want to delete, but also don't want to turn up in every search result.	chriswaco	t3_5mp7bb
t3_5mp7bb	t1_dc5fzhc	1483863097	I concur whole heartedly. If you are saving their contact just so you don't answer their phone calls, then put all these people's numbers under one contact named "Do Not Answer".	Mcgomez	t1_dc5c3jr

t3_5mp7bb	t1_dc5i1xu	1483869335	Hope it's clear enough for /u/bcxx143 to figure out. (I don't think you can put a contact in a group in iOS... might be wrong) Basically go to iCloud.com #contacts or if you own a Mac opens the contacts app. Create a new group and drag the contacts in  then on your phone in the Phone or Contacts app go to groups untick the one you don't want to see.	ideaprison	t1_dc5hbyb

t3_5mp7bb	t1_dc5ihvw	1483870814	You can do it there too pretty much the same way! For example I use a google calendar for one contact group solely for mail contact images but those don't show up when I compose something.	ideaprison	t1_dc5ia54

t3_5mp7bb	t1_dc5py8t	1483890072	This is what I do. Because if I just delete the number and that person does ever call/text, then I might answer it if I don't know the number.   I had it happen one time. I was waiting on a phone interview for a new job, and got a call from a number I didn't recognize. When I answered, it was the sleazy ex instead of the interview. That's when I started saving all telemarketers and other people I don't want to talk to all together under one contact named "DO NOT ANSWER".	GemJoon	t1_dc5fzhc

Turned on airplane mode and the router stops seeing the iPhone. Turned off airplane mode and locked the phone. Checked my router again 10-15 min later and it's still connected.  Plus if it didn't stay connected I would probably have seen a huge increase in data usage which hasn't happened.	hummuschips	t1_dc5vudr

There was a time when it wouldn't stay connected for me as well and that was opposite from what I'm used to with iOS. I've owned most iPhones as well as a bunch of Android devices and if it didn't stay connected I would be really annoyed. There was a time when my iPad kept disconnecting when locked but that hasn't happened in a while now.  I think I ended up backing it up, wiping and reinstalling iOS on it and then restoring the backup as a last resort.	hummuschips	t1_dc5xnth

Also, since this is my first i device I must say I am amazed by the battery life. I mean all day without charging blows me away. I'm sure the small screen helps play a role, but that also means less room for battery. I'm really impressed with battery life.	enjoyitalready	t1_dc3tdlb

The iPhone SE seems that it would be great for this.  I'm scared they won't make any more and that I will have to suffer these huge blocks of electronics for always.  I made a mistake buying the iPhone 6s+.  It is an unwieldy Viking shield that I am always anchored to.  It's my own fault, and also we are locked into paying it off.

t3_5mx4lq	t1_dc7041m	1483962629	I currently have a Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus and I keep telling myself to take the case off and use it as is to see it in all its glory. I don't care about it getting scuffed since I never plan on reselling it since this is the first time I saved up and bought my first phone but every time I want to take the case off I just think how much nicer it'll look years down the line when I go back and see this beautiful machine without a scratch looking like it just came out fresh from the factory.	TheJohnny346	t3_5mx4lq
t3_5mx4lq	t1_dc70lrb	1483963965	I have a matte black and although I wear a case I still like to keep it free from scratches. They might not be visible, but when I wear a transparent case, show it off or whatever, then I prefer no scratches. I do switch every year, so it's not really an issue.   Just switches my 6S Plus last week and it too was spotless/ scratch free.	FrederikTwn	t3_5mx4lq
t3_5mve71	t1_dc70xke	1483964825	Agree with the first 2. 3d touch is super useful when moving the cursor around and a faster touch id is important because it is the most interacted feature of the phone.   However... "A greater selfie shooter" That I disagree. I don't own a iPhone 7+ but it is disappointing enough for me to learn that the secondary camera is not as good as the primary camera (poorer low light shots and lack of OIS). Also the 2x optical zoom does not work when it is low light condition and that it will just use the primary camera instead. It somehow really defeats the purpose of the secondary camera.   The only use is portrait mode but it isn't perfect and some single camera phones can do similar effect as well such as the Samsung's Selective focus mode since S5 (Might be not as good as the 7+ but it is pretty good already).	mitchytan92	t1_dc6ytvj
t3_5mve71	t1_dc71257	1483965147	I am no expert but it looks pretty nice already IMO. Especially when you compared to some of the shots others shared on this sub.	mitchytan92	t1_dc6u3b0

t3_5mve71	t1_dc71c43	1483965817	The secondary camera has never been as good as the primary camera on any phone ever.  What are you getting at exactly? That's why it is a second camera.	OptionalCookie	t1_dc70xke
t3_5mve71	t1_dc71dob	1483965921	Yeah that is why I don't ever like the dual camera. What is the point? Just give us a single great camera. See all the how everyone always ranked the Pixel and S7 as the best camera phones?	mitchytan92	t1_dc71c43

When I'm selling my phones they look as good as day one. I remember one time few years back I dropped my phone (slipped out of the pocket) and I had a scuff on the corner. Phone was one month old but I couldn't stand it and I sold it at a loss just to buy a new one. That applies to all my stuff, whether it's car, laptop or a phone.

t3_5mx4lq	t1_dc76r04	1483975300	I keep my phone for 3 years rather than 2 so the scratches when I come to resell affect the resale value less than a 2yr old phone (% wise).  For that reason I'm not that anal about it.  If I was on an annual upgrade plan I would case the shit out of my phone as a scratch can easily cost you £100 or more after a year.	santaisafraud	t3_5mx4lq

t3_5mtcqd	t1_dc7n9d4	1483994621	Hey there, I recently had to return an iPhone 7 for that very reason. Coming from Android and the world of superamoled, I wondered if it was the difference in the type of screen. It got to the point where I would start getting sharp stinging pains in my eye and having trouble focusing after using the phone for a short period of time. I tried making the font-size the biggest it could be and keeping night light mode on all the time, but I concluded that my eyesight was more important. I've been wondering if the SE or 7 plus models would give me the same experience. I'm a little nervous to try, but would really love to use an iphone.	JPLime	t3_5mtcqd

And a lot of times updates ruin that.   That's why I tend to tell my less tech savvy, new phone once every 4 years family members to just update once to the next major iOS iteration and leave it at that. Performance is pretty crappy for older phones running the latest iOS.	Yo_2T	t3_5n16px
t3_5n16px	t1_dc7z9su	1484009115	My 5S is still on 8.3 mainly for jailbreak reasons (I missed the window for IOS9 jailbreak while waiting for untethered) and I really have no reason to upgrade to the latest IOS. The phone works fine, flies through most apps. But I am starting to run into incompatibilities with some newer apps that require IOS9 or above. I think I'll just wait for the new iPhone in Sept before giving up on this one.	the_fett_man	t3_5n16px
t3_5n16px	t1_dc7zbux	1484009190	Some apps require the latest iOS version. When I was using my 5s with iOS 7 jailbreak, the first thing I have to do before downloading an app is to see whether the os version is compatible or not. It didn't seem like a big issue but it really bothered me whenever the apps in top charts require the latest iOS version.	liavoid	t3_5n16px
t3_5n16px	t1_dc814kl	1484011479	I upgraded on my 5S to iOS10 due to the security updates. But I've been hating it ever since I've upgraded. Nothing works as well as it used to, multitasking sucks now because the increased memory footprint in iOS10 now causes many apps to have to refresh when I switch apps. The alarms no longer work as well as they used to.  Overall, a significant downgrade from iOS9.	funforfire	t3_5n16px
t3_5n16px	t1_dc81iw0	1484011978	Am I the only person who hasn't had bad luck with updates? My phone never lags or breaks or anything from updates. Only been on the iPhone world since the 5, now I have a 6, running latest iOS like everyone else. Don't treat my phone particularly amazing, I drop it and have broken the screen twice on this one.   What's the deal with updates seeming to break everyone else's phone?  Now to answer OP.. there's no real crazy reason to update. Unless there's a feature or app you specifically want that only works on new versions. I just update cuz I find it interesting to test new features and stuff.	guydawg	t3_5n16px

t3_5n16px	t1_dc84tmz	1484015983	My phones have noticeably slowed down after the 3rd major update, but the phone is pretty worn out in general anyway. Overall, I only wait a couple of days to make sure there are no major issues and then update.	TbonerT	t1_dc81iw0

As an owner of a 6, it does work when it's in charge, but I've only used it twice ever since I forget that it's a thing, and it didn't work one of those two times.

t3_5mx4lq	t1_dc8yuu9	1484069545	Which is why I am so into the Apple cases which have the inner microsuede lining. They're expensive and offer no protection on the bottom but if you're a careful user, the case will protect the phone well from those dust specks that get in between the case and phone.	SJUNLIN	t1_dc7jy50
t3_5mx4lq	t1_dc8yxsr	1484069639	I once had that thinking with my iPhone 5. That the wear and tear gives it a unique look that screams 'me' but over the years, my OCD is getting the better of me and even a tiny scratch can sometimes drive me crazy as well.	SJUNLIN	t1_dc7baot
t3_5mx4lq	t1_dc8z29r	1484069779	Yea, I do upgrade my phone yearly but I do not think I'll be selling my 7+ when I get my hands on the next iPhone. It'll serve as a backup phone, an iOS beta tester and a testing device for all other 3rd party software and app tweaks. But having said that, I'm still rather anal about scratches.	SJUNLIN	t1_dc76r04

t3_5mx4lq	t1_dc8z6or	1484069913	Yea the first few scratches are painful. But after that you kinda get used to it and don't baby your phone as much. Which is why I'm on the fence about wanting to sell mine off at a loss to rebuy or just stick to what I have and move on. I don't intend to sell this when I get my hands on the next iPhone this September though.	SJUNLIN	t1_dc7kq2h

t3_5n30dw	t1_dc911x9	1484071999	That's one interpretation. Another is that the AI is forcing it's opinions on humans VERY passive aggressively.  The AI revolution won't be fought with guns, but passive aggressive high school bullshit.	wagedomain	t1_dc8k6gi
t3_5n30dw	t1_dc913ud	1484072060	I have a couple issues, myself. For one, I can only seem to calibrate Siri to recognize my voice properly in one specific environment. If I calibrate it in my car, then it doesn't recognize my voice in my house. If I calibrate it in my home, it doesn't recognize my voice in my car or my work studio. In the end, I had decided to calibrate it for my car because that seemed the most useful for what I often use Siri for. Even then, it's a crapshoot whether or not Siri follows a command properly.   I used to try to convince myself I liked Siri. I even tried getting my wife on board with Siri, but she always refused. But if I'm being honest with myself, I've all but given up on the feature. It works sometimes, but it fails to properly respond to my requests often enough that it sometimes feels not worth the effort to even try.	Oliver_Cat	t1_dc8zmfv
t3_5mx4lq	t1_dc91h4f	1484072475	But as you said, it doesn't protect the bottom, my wife have case like this, she dropped the phone only ones and unfortunately the phone have dropping markets.	10EtZe	t1_dc8yuu9

t3_5n30dw	t1_dc9351y	1484074327	How? You can see the readout of what Siri thought you said and then acted on. If it converts what you say properly but then drops the ball, that's siri dropping the ball, not a misunderstood command.	DudeWithThePC	t1_dc92qhw
t3_5mx4lq	t1_dc9375o	1484074392	Yea but the iPhone 7s' housing cannot be replaced by ourselves or 3rd parties if we want to maintain the water resistance capability. Now that's a bummer.

t3_5n6wt8	t1_dc957ot	1484076638	No, don't do that. The only reliable way to make sure you don't lose them is to keep them in the case, all the time based on instinct. You take them out? Put them in the case   They are amazingly easy to lose, so put them in their container which keeps them charged and much harder to lose.	Njwest	t3_5n6wt8
t3_5n30dw	t1_dc966sa	1484077729	You don't need to tell her what to do with the information. Simply ask what you want to know. So instead of saying "Search for how big is the sun" you should say "Alexa, how big is the sun?". Speak to her naturally, like you would a person, you'll get better responses as that's how she's programmed.  I think you'll find you'll get on much better now. :)  If you find you need any more assistance, feel free to join us over on /r/AmazonEcho.

t3_5n6wt8	t1_dc99lgv	1484081545	Yeah I made the mistake of throwing them in my coat pocket and figured they'd be fine for a few minutes like that but it took way more effort to dig through the coins, gum wrappers and bus transfers to find them than it would have to just put them in the case (yes I need to clean my pockets out, no I probably won't).	tim_buckanowski	t1_dc957ot

t3_5n30dw	t1_dc9du0u	1484086266	I don't understand how Apple has completely dropped the ball with Siri. It's been 6 years and it basically does the same thing it did back on the 4s.

Because whoever designed/made this housing just removed a plastic antenna line without really considering (or just didn't care about) how it would affect the radio transparency/the housing's usefulness as an antenna, since Apple designed the newer iPhones to use parts of the housing as antenna components.  The "6 Mini" somehow got away with this redesign, presumably because the iPhone 6's "aluminum isolated by an elongated plastic "D" on either end" antenna design is similar to the original "glass inset for radio transparency" design in the 5/5s/SE. In turn that may have resulted in similarly placed feed points internally.  I think the weaker signal has half to do with reduced radio transparency and the other half due to the change in insulated/isolated areas detuning the antenna(s). [Pictures illustrating the change in housing material/design and its effect on Wi-Fi signal strength](http://imgur.com/a/sUXys).  It's not tremendously worse, but it's noticeable. I don't have enough SIM cards to extensively test cellular reception, but we can assume that it suffers from the same signal degradation that Wi-Fi gets.  Edit: elaboration	vantt1	t1_dc9m42y
t3_5n5bpz	t1_dc9wvtj	1484111258	It sure looks cool! http://imgur.com/a/PARpm  Edit: signal sucks (possibly more than the 7 Mini housing; see [here](http://imgur.com/a/sUXys)) due to having non-existent antenna components in the housing (since they are now plastic, not aluminum).	vantt1	t1_dc9ipby

t3_5n5bpz	t1_dc9yay1	1484113595	Interesting. I've noticed there are two different 6mini housings, ones that have recessed headphone/lightning ports and ones that are flush. Do you have experience with only the recessed?	anchoricex	t1_dc9wgn7
t3_5n5bpz	t1_dc9yfmj	1484113820	It'd be challenging, but it seems doable. Lining the inside of those antenna areas with metallic foil, maybe? That's basically how it's done in plastic phones.	vantt1	t1_dc9xldo
t3_5n5bpz	t1_dc9yp68	1484114282	Yeah, there are indeed two versions of the 6 Mini. 1st gen/old (flush) and 2nd gen/new (recessed). The former fits into normal iPhone 5 phone cases, the latter does not. I've only ever done the 2nd gen recessed version.	vantt1	t1_dc9yay1
t3_5nabuk	t1_dca066t	1484117089	I made the switch from an S7 Edge to a 6S Plus. The battery life is a huge difference, my S7 Edge was Verizon branded so apparently it had the crappier snapdragon chip and I was getting around 5-5.5 hours SOT. With the 6S Plus I've never managed to drain the battery yet but I seem to be losing 10% for every 1 hour or 1.5 hours of SOT, so it's usually on pace for 10-12.5 hours SOT. Huge, huge improvement. I never need to worry about battery life anymore which is a relief.  For display the Samsung is obviously king when it comes to vibrancy, those nice amoled displays are what they're known for. However the iPhone is no slouch either, I honestly can't really tell the difference anymore with phones that are at least 1080p. They all look great. I think the general consensus is also that the cameras between the iPhone 7 and Samsung S7 are head to head, just depends if you like a more natural image (iPhone) or more saturated image that 'pops' more (Samsung).  If it wasn't for those edges (I hate how they distort images and video) and broken GPS functionality, I would have stuck with my S7 Edge though. I've never experienced lag like you have, it was very snappy in my experience. But I'm glad I finally went for an iPhone, it's my first one ever and it's been great.	wewantthefunk354	t3_5nabuk

t3_5nacpp	t1_dca4lbn	1484128597	The price is a tad high, but it doesn't look like they skimped on anything when it come to unlockable items.	mattchoo86	t3_5nacpp
t3_5nabuk	t1_dca5lgv	1484131737	I left the S7 Edge for an iPhone 7+ a few days ago.  **Display** The 7+ is bright. Like really bright but the s7e is super vibrant. There's not much to write home about when it comes to major differences but if I had to choose, I'd choose the s7e.  **Camera** I'd give the slight edge to the s7e when it comes to stills but an edge to the 7+ when it comes to video. Autofocus on the 7+ is noticeably slower than the s7e but that doesn't mean the 7+ is slow in any way. The 7+ portrait mode is impressive though. You can create some extremely nice depth of field shots.  **Battery life** I am one of those people that would go to the extreme and try to squeeze out as much juice in my battery life as possible. I spent approximately 3/4th of a year with the s7e while I've only had the 7+ for a few days so I don't have much data to compare. However, I can honestly say that the standby time for the 7+ is ridiculously impressive. While the s7e's standby drain is not that bad, the 7+ definitely has almost no drain during standby.  As for SOT, I got on avg 4.5 hours SOT on my s7e that's with bluetooth, LTE, no wifi, sometime youtube videos, a lot of messenging and facebook, and occasional google play music streaming. I usually end the day with about 30%. With the 7+, like I said, I don't have much data but I can say that I have been ending the day with around 50% with roughly the same usage. This may change though as I use the phone more.  --- --- Honestly, the reason I switched to an iphone was not the s7e's fault. I really had no problems with the s7e other than the edge sometimes get in the way. I simply got bored of android and had the opportunity to upgrade phones. So I gave the s7e to my dad and got myself an iphone 7+ just to have a change of pace. Honestly, if T-Mobile had offered the google pixel I would have went that route. So far though, I don't regret switching to iPhone. I'm not biased towards other OSes but I do admit that they each have their own features that they're really good at.	Hotsushi	t3_5nabuk

t3_5nabuk	t1_dcayos5	1484170888	I had the (T-Mobile) S7 and the S7e, switched to the (Qualcomm) 7+.  I have no idea where you're getting "noticable lag" and "abysmal battery life" from, might have been a defect with your phone or a rogue app creating wakelocks.  That being said, I get similar battery life on my Edge as I do on the 7+, which is better than the flat S7 for sure.  Battery life isn't one of my major concerns though, and I prefered the usage on the flat compared to the edge.  This is personal preference though.  I've noticed some lag/freezes with the iPhone, but I'm chalking that up to a new OS version.  It's not perfect, but I'm willing to look past the (very seldomly seen) bug.  Again, if you got lag or lockups with the S7, I would highly suggest wiping everything and starting over.  Something is definitely not right there.  As for the display and camera...  Once you get used to AMOLED, nothing can beat it.  I put it on "basic" in the display options, and it still looks absolutely fantastic.  The iPhone's display is great.  The S7 is better.  Camera - Too close to tell, really.  In every day usage, they're very, very even.  In low light, I much prefer the S7.  In bright light, they're neck &amp; neck with a slight advantage to the iPhone.  If Portrait mode worked in lower lighting conditions, it would definitelty sway me to the iPhone's side.  OS - You didn't ask about this, but... Nobody can tell you which is better.  Only you can decide that.  I've been working with the 7+ since october, and I like it, but I still like Android more.  There's just silly things I just can't get used to, like the reddit apps and the notifications.	TIFUbyResponding	t3_5nabuk

t3_5nabuk	t1_dcbfuou	1484192792	True, I agree that it's more of a sidegrade and not really a true upgrade, just a nice breath of fresh air when I feel like changing things up. I used my S7 Edge for the first time in awhile today and may have underestimated the battery life of the S7 Edge in my initial post, I'm down to about 62% battery right now with 2 hours and 40 minutes SOT. And this is with Always on Display enabled too so that probably drains a tiny bit of the battery in standby as well. I did do a factory reset and am running touchwiz now, before I was running 3rd party launchers such as nova and the Pixel launcher which may have affected the battery. Or maybe some app was going crazy, who knows.  Also after using the Samsung for a day I've realized that I miss the Samsung's notification system compared to the iPhone's. The Samsung's multicolored blinking LED along with having a text/snap/facebook message/email/etc icon on the top left of the screen always made me aware at all times when I had someone trying to contact me. On the iPhone there's no such icon anywhere on the screen to indicate any messages and there is no blinking LED to remind you, the only way to check is to swipe down on the screen to bring up notifications. I can't tell you how many times I've completely forgot about someone's snap or text since switching to the iPhone, I feel like an asshole responding back hours late. On my Samsung I always finish whatever I'm doing or reading on the net, notice the icon, and respond back within minutes. Or I just see my phone blinking and know that someone messaged me. Really wish the iPhone had that. Also no landscape mode in the official Reddit and Facebook apps? Cmon Apple  But yes, more of a sidegrade than an upgrade.	wewantthefunk354	t1_dcaaaa6

t3_5nh45k	t1_dcc1s7g	1484236450	Possibly, people writing posts here asking why their brand new phone has contacts for people they've never heard of and strange photos already there seldom specify where they bought that new phone. Only that it was brand new and factory shrink-wrapped, as if they'd know who wrapped it. Stores are notorious for this behavior.	portnux	t1_dcblrh7

t3_5nqhau	t1_dcdprce	1484324797	Welcome to the club.  People will claim it is a battery issue and it needs to be replaced even though Apple tells you your batter is fine.  Just wait until it start crashing continuously.  Mine started like yours, now I cannot do anything on my phone for more than 5 minutes without it crashing and me having to plug it in.  I have found having it on low power mode helps some.  I am waiting for the next update, but don't have my hopes up.  If this was just a battery issue, you would not have this many people with iPhone 6's having this problem all starting around the time of the last couple of updates.  They did something on the software side that is causing this.  And yet Apple has not acknowledged it yet.	defroach84	t3_5nqhau
t3_5nqhau	t1_dcdrt2q	1484327129	It might be worth a try to calibrate your battery. I had an issue with my 6 Plus after the iOS 10.2 update where my battery wouldn't go over 95%. I just let my battery die and left it overnight to charge in the morning. I charged it the next morning and it never did it again. I know you are experiencing different issues but it would be worth giving it a shot if you already haven't.	gspires24	t3_5nqhau

t3_5nqhau	t1_dcdx4ex	1484333041	It seriously sucks. It sat on the charger for 3 hours this morning and went from 85% to 92. Such bullshit. I have been putting it on low power mode and it does seem to help some. I just upgraded iOS and it took eons and made no difference.	gringapower	t1_dcdprce

t3_5nsvp7	t1_dce3bg5	1484339941	Out of the ones I can answer:  5.) Wifi calling is fine for me with iPhone. Had the 6s+ then switched to android and couldn't use it with my V20. So I assume if the 6s+ worked fine then so will the 7.   6.) Yep  7.) https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-1588	taboo007	t3_5nsvp7
t3_5nsvp7	t1_dce3kkz	1484340233	Someone traded me an 6s plus 128gb for my s7. That's double the value, where I live, it was a no-brainer.	fortean	t1_dce2utx
t3_5nsvp7	t1_dce3wg4	1484340615	Are you happy with the size of the phone?	rajarshi_ghosh	t1_dce3kkz
t3_5nsvp7	t1_dce45o1	1484340910	It's bigger than it should be, for sure, but it's not an issue to me. The best phone I've ever owned is the Lumia 1520 that's actually bigger than the 6s plus, and I really liked the Nexus 6 too.  It's really not a phone for everyone though. My wife absolutely hates it.	fortean	t1_dce3wg4
t3_5nsvp7	t1_dce5jzh	1484342564	I for one switched from the S7 to the iPhone 7 and I'm regretting my move. Android was so much better than this. Seems like someone cut off my wings.	rajarshi_ghosh	t1_dce45o1
t3_5nsvp7	t1_dce5ze5	1484343081	The s7 is an excellent phone for sure. I don't have a problem switching platforms myself. I miss certain things on Android but overall I think the experience on my iphone is miles better, no slowdown, battery that I couldn't dream on any android phone (end the day with 80% is insane). I cannot think of anything I actually miss from Android other than my notification sounds for email, but I'll live without them.  Having said that, the s7 has been, by far, the best Android phone I've ever owned. I hope the S8 is even better.	fortean	t1_dce5jzh
t3_5nsvp7	t1_dce6cb0	1484343515	I'll jump to the S8 when it releases provided it doesn't explode. Hope I can get a good resale value for my iPhone 7 which is just about a week old.	rajarshi_ghosh	t1_dce5ze5

t3_5nuuq2	t1_dceik8l	1484360600	The iPhone is a smart device that knows how many amps it can pull without damaging it. I've asked at multiple Apple Stores and all the Specialists I've asked said it was completely fine to charge the iPhone with the iPad charger.	TheJohnny346	t1_dcei50l
t3_5nuuq2	t1_dcej7zg	1484361627	Yes a 2.4A, 12W charger will charge my Plus much faster. Mine is a dual usb Anker brand, also have 6 foot braided nylon cable. Works just as good as Apple with a second outlet for tablets and power bank charging.  I also have a Belkin wall mount surge protector with 3 outlets and dual 2.4A usb. Check amazon, ebay etc...	sglville	t3_5nuuq2
t3_5nsvp7	t1_dcejapf	1484361746	If you're going to buy in full, get the Verizon version from the Apple store and actually start it up using a Verizon sim (so it stays unlocked). You can put your T-Mobile sim in immediately after setup.  Better modem, unlocked, and it's universal.  Works 100% on tmobile, I have one on there right now.  Wifi calling, volte, etc all are perfect.  Edit:. I should add, the T-Mobile version IS locked to T-Mobile.	TIFUbyResponding	t3_5nsvp7
t3_5nuuq2	t1_dcejdep	1484361860	This. The iPhone will charge faster and it will not damage the battery at all.	camthehombre	t1_dceik8l
t3_5nuuq2	t1_dcejqop	1484362431	There is circuitry built in that limits the charger down to appropriate levels, you're perfectly fine to use an iPad charger on an iPhone. You may get some charging speed increase, but it shouldn't be much due to the charger purposely pulling less power.  On the flip side, you can charge an iPad with an iPhone charger, but it's going to be slow, as the iPhone charger isn't built to pull larger amounts of wattage.	NuclearLunchDectcted	t3_5nuuq2
t3_5nuuq2	t1_dcekkmo	1484363787	Well, the battery does get hotter when charging off a charger capable of higher amperage.  I don't care how far battery technology and charging technology has come... heat kills.  Period.	Nerfo2	t1_dcejdep
t3_5nuuq2	t1_dcemq7m	1484367371	Yep here you go https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01LCDJ7LG/  Im using the amazon basics 6ft braided cable but the Anker brand cable is really good too	sglville	t1_dcekwkd
t3_5nuuq2	t1_dcen32e	1484367999	Also the Belkin one http://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-BSV300-CW/  You can't fast charge two high power devices at the same time like the Anker since its 12W shared but you get 3 surge protected outlets.	sglville	t1_dcekwkd
t3_5nuuq2	t1_dceq117	1484373590	&gt; You can use Apple 12W and 10W USB power adapters to charge your iPad, iPhone, iPod, Apple Watch, and other Apple accessories, like AirPods and Siri Remote. Just connect your device to the power adapter with the Lightning to USB Cable, 30-pin to USB cable, or Apple Watch charger that came with your device.   &gt;Using an Apple 12W or 10W USB power adapter can charge some Apple devices and accessories faster than a 5W power adapter. When using an Apple 29W USB-C Power Adapter and Apple USB-C to Lightning cable, you can fast charge your iPad Pro 12.9-inch.   https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202105	whtisthis	t3_5nuuq2

t3_5nuuq2	t1_dcese9s	1484379132	Yes, but faster charging means it will decrease the battery's lifespan over time.  If you're not in a rush, use the standard iPhone charger (1A output).  iPad chargers and most android chargers are 2A output, so you effectively halve the time needed to charge your phone to 100%.	rogerdchen	t3_5nuuq2
t3_5nuuq2	t1_dcesu2h	1484380345	As long as the battery isn't overheating, the charging speed is not going to matter.	tubezninja	t1_dcese9s
t3_5nuuq2	t1_dcesvjx	1484380460	Heat kills beyond  certain threshold where the battery is overheated, and the device knows where that limit is. A 2A charger alone won't raise the temperature to that point. Again, the phone is not going to pull a higher amperage than is healthy to charge the battery.  If you're charging at 2A in a hot car with the sun beating down on it, then yeah, that's going to kill your battery. But the heat in the car probably would've done that by itself eventually, charging or not.	tubezninja	t1_dcekkmo
t3_5nsvp7	t1_dcev194	1484387231	Or just buy the sim-free version. Same price and model number. That said, if the OP wants to lease through T-Mobile, make sure to go through the unlock process right away. I can't stress this enough. I waited on mine, and because I had the original device replaced under warranty at an Apple Store, it was a major pain in the ass to unlock. Literally a dozen calls to T-Mobile and hours of my life wasted. Finally Apple figured out the problem, but I was stuck with the "Sim Not Supported" message for weeks.	bonebrightd	t3_5nsvp7

t3_5nuuq2	t1_dcf3cim	1484408610	Yes, it's safe too. Remember, devices pull in the charge rather than having the charge pushed into them. They only pull what they can handle. (If there's no faultiness with the phone, the cable and charger are of good quality and not fake)	uncertain-ithink	t3_5nuuq2

t3_5o9ej8	t1_dchrscy	1484563581	I just got the 6s+ this friday :) Actually I bought it used just because of the very large price difference to the 7+, here in Sweden it would be 2x the money to get a used 7+ and probably 2.5x to ge a new base line model. I have the 64gb version and it is very fast, keeps apps in memory for a long time and hasn't stuttered once! The A9 chip is very good, however the recent switch to 4 cores with the A10 is a step in the right direction. Although since all apps have been optimized for 2 core usage for such a long time, the real world usage is negligible. Some speed tests on youtube even show the 6s+ beeing a bit speedier in certain applications.   So as I reasoned what I would be paying roughly 2x the money for is only a better camera. The maybe superior preformance in the latest 3d games do not interest me, and I can not for the life of me understand everyone's craving for water resistance, has never been a problem for me.

t3_5o9ej8	t1_dchwb2j	1484575460	Just made the switch from a lg G3 to a Apple refurbished iPhone 6s Plus 64gb for $589. Thing is practically new with a new casing, battery, and screen. Also came with a 1 year warranty from Apple.   This thing is snappy and the battery life is insane. I average about 9-10 hours of screen on time and 34 hours on a single charge.	Iammattieee	t3_5o9ej8
t3_5o9ej8	t1_dchwqoj	1484576254	Doing the same (from V20) and going with the 7 plus. I always recommend the latest version of iPhone just because of longevity reasons, and if you have the note 4 then this will last as long or longer.	taboo007	t3_5o9ej8
t3_5o9ej8	t1_dchzs6w	1484580969	Loved my 6S+. Upgraded early as part of upgrade program to 7+ and now about to be oh my 3rd 7+ due to camera issues. If I wasn't in the upgrade program I would go back to 6S+ I think. Hell, if this soon to be third 7+ has camera issues I may do it anyway for a year. I am not seeing major speed differences in the 7+ &amp; 6S Plus. Yes, faster but not crazy difference. 7+ speakers are nice. The 6S Plus/6S is a great phone.	SoCalDawg	t3_5o9ej8
t3_5o9ej8	t1_dci9nt6	1484592935	I just got a 7+ yesterday. I didn't have android but had the iPhone 5s. Still getting used to this huge screen but so far it's crazy fast and the sound and screen are fantastic.	JKCIO	t1_dchsw7k

Based on how well Apple treated me today they know it's an issue. They even said tech thinks it's software. I agree. I made my case with similar images from an iPhone 6, 6S Plus &amp; 7 Plus. They said they are sending my phone to engineers.   Hoping OS resolves. I get some AMAZING photos with the 7+ and it blows away the 6 with colors but images of people are really bad.

t3_5ofdrh	t1_dcj3nhs	1484631201	Portrait mode on the iPhone 7 Plus kicks butt. The rest of it I find pretty standard, but I really like the DOF effect portrait mode gets you.

t3_5ofdrh	t1_dcj7trs	1484640543	I agree.  Whilst the 7 Plus camera is great for a smartphone, it's not as good as I expected it to be given all of the love it's been getting.   It's more than good enough to use as a day to day camera, and a big improvement over my 5S, but I still don't think it's as good as my 7 year old compact camera (and obviously, it's vastly inferior to my SLR).   That's not too surprising, given the difference in lenses between them. But from what I'd seen elsewhere, I was still half expecting to be truly blown away by the quality, and I'm not.	prof_hobart	t1_dcj2psa
t3_5ofdrh	t1_dcj80f7	1484641042	I've yet to see a picture taken by a normal consumer (as opposed to marketing material or otherwise professional photos) on the iPhone 7 that is clearly superior to what could be achieved with my iPhone 6. Anyone have an example?	jaysire	t3_5ofdrh
t3_5ofdrh	t1_dcj85rl	1484641435	Which 7 year old compact camera ya talking about? Seriously interested.

t3_5ofs7y	t1_dcjh2ed	1484663539	In all fairness, two winters ago my girlfriend dropped her 5S with Otterbox Commuter case off her lap getting out of the car, it fell into 4 inches of snow, she went inside, and went to sleep. Didn't notice it was missing until the next morning. Went outside and found it face down in the snow. Picked it up, the phone was off and the front was a solid sheet of ice. Thought for sure it was toast. We brought it inside, I picked the ice off, and left it inside to thaw and dry out for a few hours. Turned it back on, and it worked perfectly fine until the day we sold it a year later. The 7 is water resistant officially but the older ones weren't so fragile either	Corse46	t3_5ofs7y

t3_5ofs7y	t1_dcjiz1d	1484666280	Once the phone cooled to ambient temperature, it just collected snow. No water formed.

Apple said I had to pay to get it fixed (which is sorta understandable because I dropped it in water on purpose) but I taught the Apple Store "genius" what IP67 meant and they fixed it for free :)	smith7018	t1_dcj3jt9

t3_5ofs7y	t1_dcjkkwz	1484668363	They likely fixed it for free because they wanted to capture the unit and see what you did to it to break seal(s) in the device and not because you "taught the Apple Store 'genius' what IP67 meant."	Whodiditandwhy	t1_dcjjbua

t3_5ofs7y	t1_dcjl43g	1484669016	Yeah, something was wrong with the phone and they wanted to find out how, based on what you said happened. This is typical of the Genius Bar right after a new product is introduced. Usually a no-questions asked repair/exchange (except screen cracks, because duh). You didn't teach anyone anything, they just needed the device to figure out why it did that in such a small amount of water. I, personally, shower with it practically every day (not always in full-contact with water) and my little cousins play with it by splashing it in the sink; no problems here.	Jeremiareyes	t1_dcjjbua
t3_5ofs7y	t1_dcjmmw8	1484670836	Carful if you take hot showers just because it's water resistant does not mean steam can't get into the device somehow and then mess it up	Ps4_and_Ipad_Lover	t1_dcjl43g
t3_5ofs7y	t1_dcjmpn8	1484670927	Per [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207043)  &gt;iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are splash, water, and dust resistant and were tested under controlled laboratory conditions with a rating of IP67 under IEC standard 60529. Splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions, and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. Liquid damage is not covered under warranty.    - Resistance may decrease.  And they don't cover damage.   So that rating is essentially useless from a user standpoint as I don't know and I'm not covered.	unreqistered	t1_dcjkhdm

See, the ads say 'AppleCare doesn't cover water damage' and 'iPhone is not water proof' so it's your fault." Calmly, I asked if the guy knew what water resistant meant and he said "It means water can get on it without damaging the device." I replied "IP67 rating actually means you can submerge the phone in a meter of water for up to 30 minutes without breaking. Can we agree that the video I showed you wasn't over one meter of water?" "Well, sure." "And can we agree that I probably didn't leave it in the glass for over 30 minutes?" "Probably." "So then can we agree that there was probably a defect in the phone that would have shown up sooner or later because the phone apparently isn't 'water resistant?'" He agreed and then went to the back to talk to the manager and came back to the front ten minutes later and said "Well, it looks like we're going to cover it for you because something must've been wrong with the device."  Sure, maybe they covered it to see what's wrong with it but I literally had to break down what IP67 was to get them to cover it.

t3_5ofs7y	t1_dcjunz9	1484680045	The Apple Watch series 2 is rated water resistant to ~150ft, yet apple says don't do anything more than light submersion (swimming etc).   Clearly apple is being very conservative with their descriptions, and for good reason (they are trying to reduce their liability) but that doesn't change the device's water resistance abilities	southwestern_swamp	t1_dcjmpn8

t3_5okgl8	t1_dcjz3s3	1484685032	It will really just depend on where you live, how many lines you have, how much data you use, etc.   In my case, switching to att's 20gb family plan was the best move.

t3_5okgl8	t1_dck0ww4	1484687077	Oh jeez. So here is what i recommend. Look into getting T-Mobile ONE. It's only $120/mo for 2 lines and thats with taxes &amp; fees included (meaning you will never pay more than $120 for the price of the plan, excluding any financed phones).   It also includes WiFi hotspot (unlimited, but at a slower speed), BingeON and Music Freedom (most video streaming and music will not count towards your data usage).   One big downside is that video streaming is limited to 480p, but they do offer day passes, which I think are free, but you would have to ask /r/tmobile about that because I have an older T-Mobile plan I don't know much about that.    https://explore.t-mobile.com/t-mobile-one?icid=WMM_TM_Q117UCNXT_MHEHP4Y934W7224	TheBKBurger	t1_dck09it

t3_5okgl8	t1_dck1gop	1484687697	Any video that has HD quality will be limited to SD when on the T Mobile network. You can get a day pass to watch any video in HD.   That's the one downside to the plan.	TheBKBurger	t1_dck1a7h

t3_5okgl8	t1_dck5lkh	1484692420	Well that they can tell. They know when you're on a video and what you're doing. When you visit a website on their network, you're communicating with their network of servers asking them to take you to a specific website.   BingeOn is the program they implemented for the unlimited video streaming at 480p (SD) if you wanna research further.	TheBKBurger	t1_dck57x3

t3_5ofs7y	t1_dck8xpy	1484696361	A couple of years ago my friend had his iPad stolen. He made a police report, bought a new one and assumed he would never see it again. The police pulled the security footage from the store he was in when it was stolen a couple of weeks later and immediately recognized the thief as he was a repeat offender and showed up at his house. The guy claimed he left the store and felt bad that he had stolen it and thew it over a snowbank down the street from the store. Return it? Nah, just ditch it lol. Thinking that he was full of shit the cops dragged him to the spot where he said he threw it and the guy went and dug it out of the snow. It was still on, the battery hadn't even died after 2+ weeks.	goonerhsmith	t3_5ofs7y
t3_5ofs7y	t1_dckb5hf	1484699147	Apple very clearly says they do not cover water damage under warranty.

t3_5onmbr	t1_dckvepd	1484736329	I used to love Flickr, but I'm incredibly frustrated with how poorly yahoo! has handled it. They gave everyone a terabyte a few years ago (fun fact: I met Marissa Mayer the day this was announced, as she had just purchased a company I worked for) and never bothered to actually upgrade the platform.  Flickr should have been a major competitor for Instagram, providing a platform for a more artistic and professional content and context over Instagram. But it's like they didn't care about mobile at all.  Flickr also never bothered getting in to AI and auto tagging, which makes it hard to think of it as a proper photo archival service.  I prefer iCloud Photos. Secure. Cheap. Works seamlessly with everything I own.	shapeshiftingrobot	t3_5onmbr

t3_5onmbr	t1_dckwd6h	1484739370	For Flickr, you can backup photos up to 1tb. But videos has limit of 3 mins.   Google photos is much more powerful than Flickr. Offers better photos organization, you can change date and time, photos-like integration of albums, better search, can re download full resolution photos again to phone, and backs up Live Photos too.	mattboner	t3_5onmbr
t3_5onmbr	t1_dckxdya	1484742176	Exactly, so suggesting one is preferable to the other because of "trust" is a bit redundant.	Stazalicious	t1_dckwuxl
t3_5onmbr	t1_dckyd3s	1484744454	I like Flickr more because I can sort photos into albums alphabetically. All I want for my photos is to let me create albums and let me sort them how I want to. I really hate how Google discontinued Picasa as it at least allowed you to sort.	SoulSleeper	t3_5onmbr
t3_5onmbr	t1_dckyfep	1484744589	I see your point of "trust" of who's using your data for profit. But that's a little off topic of what we're talking about. Which company do you trust that would have the security to protect your data from hackers? Most of us choose google for this reason. They have the best tech people in the world to make sure everything is protected the best it can be. It's not a matter if it can be hacked but when.	pokeball22	t1_dckxdya
t3_5onmbr	t1_dckygrs	1484744669	No it's not.  The reason cited: trust in relation to preventing potential threats from insidious sources looking to access your data.  The 'other' trust: Trusts the above is much less likely to occur with Google.  Also, Google are up front about how they use your data, you agree to it if you want, if you don't, you don't use their services. Simple. It's totally different.	Nupa_Star	t1_dckxdya
t3_5onmbr	t1_dckyiuf	1484744789	Perhaps yep, the question was about preference, the answer was about trust.  As far as I'm concerned they're both terrible and neither should be trusted with your data. My intention is to raise awareness of this.	Stazalicious	t1_dckyfep
t3_5onmbr	t1_dckyjo3	1484744838	Even if I had to pay for Google/Apple Photos (well I do with the latter), I'd use it over anything Yahoo! provides for free.	Nupa_Star	t3_5onmbr
t3_5onmbr	t1_dckzxnm	1484747443	Apple are the only ones that have explicitly said they do not want to know anything about your photos or data. Yes they got socially hacked in the Frappening but they have since introduced mandatory two-factor identification.   I still don't trust them, but then I'm not suggesting people should choose them over anyone else.	Stazalicious	t1_dckzlqg
t3_5okgl8	t1_dcl10mn	1484749219	Oh they know everything that goes on.   But I'm pretty sure that it only downgrades the quality of certain streaming sites like Netflix and YouTube.	crisss1205	t1_dck57x3
t3_5okgl8	t1_dcl11y7	1484749274	If you only use 3GB a month, you could have saved a lot of money by switching to a tried data plan years ago.   It's $60 for 3GB of data with unlimited talk and text.	crisss1205	t1_dck0093

t3_5onmbr	t1_dcl3llr	1484752871	The fappening wasn't a hack. That was someone guessing passwords. Major difference. Apple sees your data for ads too. Either for app suggestions or how to market you products. It's how any company is doing it. Apple is no different. They forced 2 factory because they were the biggest punching bag because everyone was screaming apple iCloud hacking. They wanted out of the medias attention.	pokeball22	t1_dckzxnm
t3_5okgl8	t1_dcl72ui	1484757128	There are probably a couple dozen ways of  doing something like this.  They could run a proxy, there could be internal logic to use the lower of any MBR stream, they could have server side agreements with video providers, etc.	tchang	t1_dck57x3

t3_5oqhnx	t1_dcl8r02	1484759052	I don't think there is a way. Screen replacements have to go through Apple in order for TouchID to work IIRC.	TheBKBurger	t3_5oqhnx
t3_5onmbr	t1_dcl971m	1484759568	It wasn't a hack. Nothing was hack, no back door tools, nothing of the sort. It was a person who had their email info guessed then their password. A hack is finding holes in coding or infrastructure. The media miss uses the word. If it was a hack then it would be apples fault for  not having better or stopping the hacking. So I guess your email and password it isn't hacking. It's a really bad idea to use common knowledge for back up questions when your life is public.

t3_5oqhnx	t1_dclg2sb	1484767179	Not too hard. Just 2 or 3 screws and a single plate. Just don't tighten the screws on the plate all the way tight or the button won't click as much as it should. And be super careful with the flex, it folds over on itself and a little hole on it fits into a raised piece on the screen.

t3_5owhth	t1_dcmn6vz	1484837070	Definitely wait. There is not a significant enough difference to upgrade. Only reason I made the upgrade from 6s plus to 7 plus is because I ran out of memory. If not, definitely would have waited for the next iPhone.	Fender6969	t3_5owhth

t3_5owhth	t1_dcmq922	1484841057	Yeah wait. It's not that big of a jump. I would say even if you had a perfectly good 6 to wait. The iPhone 7 is basically the 6ss.	taboo007	t3_5owhth

t3_5owwzf	t1_dcmrwcl	1484842992	Go for the plus. The battery alone would make it worth it, but the second camera is so much fun to use	Michael1521	t1_dcmr8vz

t3_5owwzf	t1_dcmxu42	1484849711	Are you serious? You clearly have no idea how modern photography works. The sky is way, way too bright. It's blurry and not sharp at all.  There would be plenty of detail in that image. It's fucking pathetic if you people think this image looks good for how expensive the iPhone 7 plus is, and how much Apple has hyped it up. A nexus 6p would absolutely annihilate it.    Go back to taking pics on your RAZR until you come back to reality, it's 2017. Cameras on phones are way, way more capable and produce much better pictures than this turd of a photo.	areallytallguy	t1_dcmxern
t3_5owwzf	t1_dcmxw0w	1484849768	I got the jet black, I'm in love.  I don't like to put a case on my phone as wear and tear doesn't bother me and I'm not prone to damage, and the extra grip the finish provides is amazing and I love that it's almost seamless	weedwhacking	t1_dcmwuta
t3_5oy13p	t1_dcmxy37	1484849832	Agreed. I mean, they're great considering it's a camera in a phone and probably better than most of us need on a daily basis, however, any real camera blows the pics taken by *any* phone clear out of the water.	Lord_Von_Fappington	t1_dcmxn7n
t3_5oy13p	t1_dcmxzz6	1484849890	I'm not a huge fan of it, it's obviously fake bokeh. Albeit well done, it's still fake and looks like ass. But hey, to each their own.	deathsnuggle	t3_5oy13p

t3_5oy13p	t1_dcmylzc	1484850559	I like this idea. To me, it's clear people love their iPhone and all but these threads are annoying. I feel it could be better served with having a sticky perhaps that can serve as a home for these posts where people can share their photos while the sub main page is here for issues and discussion about aspects of iPhone that aren't a photo.    I'm aware there are subs for iPhone photography but I think it might be nice to keep people here and allow them a place for their passion rather than send them elsewhere and react negatively to them.	examinati0n	t1_dcmwkir
t3_5oy13p	t1_dcmz69f	1484851178	I use to own a Nexus 6P and in that sub reddit they had a great solution to this: Sundays are the day to post pictures, only Sundays. So all people there wait until that day of the week to post photos taken by themselves.  That can be a great idea to implement here.   Edit: spelling.	Tito1983	t3_5oy13p

t3_5oy13p	t1_dcmzr8k	1484851822	So true. At least they finally implemented tags after 2 years so I can filter out show off posts.	shapeshiftingrobot	t1_dcmzbty
t3_5owwzf	t1_dcmzvbr	1484851945	I've had it since launch day and as I mentioned I do not put it in a case. it is pretty heavily scratched, but I don't mind at all, I knew what I was getting into when I got it. Think iPod classic. The main difference though is you cannot see them at all unless you hold it up to a very bright light source like the sun, and hold it at an extreme angle, as the scratches are the same jet black color, and looks perfectly flawless otherwise.	weedwhacking	t1_dcmy0tp
t3_5oy13p	t1_dcmzvkr	1484851952	Just downvote and move on. If this is truly a problem, enough people will downvote and you won't see them in the future.	WalterJrsBreakfast	t3_5oy13p

Seriously, if you think that's a good pic you've obviously never even touched a recent camera.   The lights are blown out at the top, the light at the side is blown out, the entire picture is overexposed, it's noisy, it's not sharp.

t3_5oz1qp	t1_dcn7kru	1484860464	Force touch is pretty nifty. Force touching an app icon will give you a bunch of shortcuts(if the app is updated to support it otherwise it'll say 'Share appname'). Or if you're in Twitter(example) and then hit home and go to Snapchat if you force touch in on the far left side and swipe to the right it'll bring back up your last app which in this instance would be Twitter. Or if you stop midway through it'll bring up the app switcher. Also if you're typing a message to someone and you notice a typo like 5 lines up if you force touch the keyboard you can easily move your cursor around and bring it back up to where you made the typo. Those are just some of the more obscure features of force touch, there's a bunch of other things you can do on it. Also, Game Pigeon is fantastic for friends and such.

t3_5oy13p	t1_dcn7vby	1484860800	Eh... The only other camera that really looked better in some shots was the Pixel. I like the realistic look to photos rather than the yellowish look of photos you get from samsung phones. That's just my opinion though.

t3_5oy13p	t1_dcn973u	1484862308	Honestly, I think it's likely to have a lot more to do with the person taking the picture than the camera used.  Something that stuck with my was a photography class I took that brought in a pro photographer.  She had gotten tired of the infatuation in the industry with technology and how it seemed like the attitude was that the camera made the photographer.  To counter that she went out and did this really amazing project where all of the photos were taking with a cheap $30 point and shoot film camera, just to make the point that lighting, composition, etc. were all far more important than how much you spent on the camera.	puterTDI	t1_dcmxy37
t3_5ozjax	t1_dcn9wpq	1484863104	+1 for Camera+.  You get full manual control AND you can specify which lens to use, which is something the native camera app doesn't do.	shapeshiftingrobot	t1_dcn9vch

t3_5oy13p	t1_dcnap68	1484864026	They've always responded right away when I've messaged them and removed the offending posts. They just don't seem to know they need to check the modqueue manually.

t3_5oy13p	t1_dcnawxm	1484864283	It might be since this is /r/iphone the mods are using reddit iPhone apps and as we all know there aren't any good reddit apps to mod with.	RubyRubyRoo	t1_dcnap68

t3_5oy13p	t1_dcncl2d	1484866294	I figured it was a response to recent issues with the camera.	SoCalDawg	t3_5oy13p
t3_5ozjax	t1_dcnd36w	1484866914	Unless I'm missing something, Pro Cam 4 does this as well. Has manual controls for exposure, as well as fine tuning shutter speed and ISO, and focus and white balance. Can take raw pics as well as let you choose which lens to use. As well as a bunch of resolution options and video options	TommyK154	t1_dcn9wpq
t3_5oy13p	t1_dcndveo	1484867915	This. If the operator knows what he's doing, he can do better than 99% of the iPhoners with mostly any camera.	shitiforgotmypasswor	t1_dcn973u
t3_5oy13p	t1_dcne4bp	1484868227	I can't tell the difference between my 6S plus and all these 7 plus photos. I've owned the 7 plus in the beginning, returned it. Not different enough to justify the $869 I spent on it. Holding off for this years, hopefully it's worth the wait.	Dinkdinkdata	t1_dcmxn7n
t3_5ozjax	t1_dcneyfm	1484869313	I use LightRoom to shoot in RAW, edit, and export to Camera Roll. Not sure how robust its editing features are, only that its basics work very well.	kekspernikai	t3_5ozjax

t3_5ozjax	t1_dcnh54j	1484872206	ProCam  But on the editing front Snapseed is the only one that is good and free. Lightroom, Darkroom and others that are free for regular photos have pretty much included the RAW editing in their premium package.	kaspis29	t3_5ozjax

t3_5owwzf	t1_dcni9ca	1484873697	I never said it was a good picture, I said it wasn't overexposed. its boring but the exposure is appropriate for a night photo. No detail is lost that would contribute to the composition. What are you hoping to see in those brightly lit areas? The texture of the facade? The whole point is the contrast of the bright lights and dark surroundings. Obviously you don't remember what taking phone photos at night was like in 2012. It would've been a bright blob surrounded by a dark blob.	Sock_of_Ir_Yut	t1_dcn1cwt

t3_5ozjax	t1_dcnnd5o	1484880703	I don't care about the cloud just want the editing. But like I said I couldn't do any editing until I signed in. We'll see what happens after this "30 day trial" is up. I hope it's like you say and it's just the cloud crap that goes away because it's a pretty nice editor comparatively to other mobile ones. Possibly the best free one I've found. Snapseed is really nice too but Lr gives your that extra bit of customization	TommyK154	t1_dcnjf0c

t3_5oy13p	t1_dcnp4vo	1484883193	The portrait mode ones really are the worst. A good portion of the time they're not uploaded at full quality, and even then you can see where the two images were stitched together.   It's an OK effect, but most of the ones I've seen probably would have been better with full DOF and no stitching seams.   That's my opinion, anyway.   On the plus side, the low light performance seems genuinely improved. Not enough to warrant an upgrade from my 6S Plus, but a nice bump in quality regardless.	Gizmotoy	t1_dcnhyuh

t3_5p8cdx	t1_dcp95pd	1484969436	Go to the Apple Store and play with the new phones. If you think the 5S is quick, you will be happily surprised. I usually upgrade every model (when the jailbreak comes out), so I usually have the new and prev versions to compare. It's hard if you don't have something to compare to.  I currently have the 6S Plus. My wife has the 6 Plus. When I use her phone I notice some delays. You get used to the "new fast" very quick and that will be your new benchmark.	michaelkloud	t3_5p8cdx

t3_5p8cdx	t1_dcpatm1	1484972155	I'm not using one, but I have two family members who haven't had any desire to upgrade because their 5Ses are still holding up well and running fast enough…I've been spoiled with newer devices, but the 5S would still be a great device to have as a backup/test device.	ecs0013	t3_5p8cdx
t3_5p8cdx	t1_dcpeupm	1484979415	It's still good, but needs a new battery and apps crash a lot. just use it for texting and twitter pretty much now	djsnickerz	t3_5p8cdx
t3_5p8cdx	t1_dcpf1ee	1484979806	It's alright. Space is a huge problem with it though.	Dravkian	t3_5p8cdx
t3_5p8cdx	t1_dcpgn0l	1484983434	Went from 5s to se in July.  Battery was fading fast, otherwise I likely would have stayed.  If you're looking for excuses to update, the se is noticeably faster, not make or break, but it's nice.  Stepping from 16 to 64gb helped me justify going for it also.	2000mc	t3_5p8cdx
t3_5p9l01	t1_dcphmct	1484985913	The iPhone 7 is a very solid phone. If you care about having the latest and greatest then wait. If you're not that tech savvy you won't be disappointed by the 7 even when the 8 comes out.	Arcgav	t3_5p9l01
t3_5p9l01	t1_dcpibbs	1484987841	I just got the 7+ last week after having gone from the original iPhone all the way through the 5s. The size is taking a little bit of time to get used to but it's great. Pictures and video are fantastic on the phone and the stereo speakers can be extremely loud for a phone. I'd highly recommend it and just know it may take some adjusting to but it's well worth it.	JKCIO	t3_5p9l01
t3_5p9r35	t3_5p9r35	1484988233	Why is this happening? Already tried factory reset...	ignaciobarrena	-1
t3_5p8cdx	t1_dcpih1e	1484988297	Agreed. Using a 16GB 5S currently. Feeling severely limited with storage and almost always operating with storage nearly maxed out. Storage was not a huge issue at the time of purchase 3 years ago and to fork out $$ for a storage upgrade at the time did not seem justifiable. This is the number one factor pushing me to upgrade.	canadian_mountainman	t1_dcpf1ee

t3_5p8cdx	t1_dcpj1za	1484990023	I'm struggling with 32 GB. Pictures and videos take up a lot of space. It was either a 128 GB iPhone 7 Plus or 32 GB and AppleCare+.	Anaron	t1_dcpih1e
t3_5p9r35	t1_dcpj4nt	1484990249	After a factory reset, did you set it up as a new phone?	TheGreatestRedditor	t3_5p9r35
t3_5p8cdx	t1_dcpj93v	1484990634	Using a 5S 16gb. Actively looking to upgrade. Space is a HUGE issue for me. The battery is a gonner, with the phone frequently dying at some point between 10-40% battery. The phone is generally slow and unable to cope, but I'm holding out for the right deal.	thetank27	t3_5p8cdx
t3_5p8cdx	t1_dcpjd3k	1484990974	I have a 6S as a work phone, so this I do agree with.  But the thing with the 6S is, its undeniably faster, but unlike years gone by the 5S isn't so slow that its suddenly become useless. What used to happen is when an iPhone hit around 3 years old, its performance had degraded so much there really wasn't any point keeping it. Thats not really the case now.  So you kind of upgrade out of a desire, not a need. You used to upgrade out of a need.	Theodoros9	t1_dcp95pd
t3_5p9r35	t1_dcpjefq	1484991090	Yep, tried restoring from a backup and as a new phone, same result.	ignaciobarrena	t1_dcpj4nt
t3_5p9r35	t1_dcpjftq	1484991213	Did you reset via Settings or restore via iTunes? If you haven't done an [iTunes restore](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/HT201252) , I'd recommend that. Removes everything from the device and reinstalls the latest version of iOS. If you need to use a backup, might be best to only use an iCloud backup.	ferrisie	t3_5p9r35
t3_5p9r35	t1_dcpjkkv	1484991634	Thanks for your answers, but I already restore it and set it as new via iTunes, I started literally from scratch and this is still happening.. I'm on an iPhone SE, with my iPhone 6 this didn't happen	ignaciobarrena	t1_dcpjftq
t3_5p9l01	t1_dcpjloo	1484991734	Just get it...you won't be disappointed.  I doubt the next one will be any smaller.  I think the size is perfect.  I came from a Note 4 and then a Nexus 6P though so I'm used to it.  You'll dig it.	lopan510	t3_5p9l01
t3_5p9r35	t1_dcpjphv	1484992082	Weird. Does it only happen with WhatsApp? Might be best to contact [Apple support](https://getsupport.apple.com/) . If a repair is needed, it should be valid for warranty.	ferrisie	t1_dcpjkkv
t3_5p8cdx	t1_dcpklea	1484995004	Mine work flawlessly, previous iOS drained battery but now its at 40% again when I get back from work (was &lt;10% before). It works too good, the only thing that might make me go for the iPhone 8 is better camera and display.  Hell, I have a gen2 iPad that still works annoyingly too good to upgrade really. But it shows it age when crashing cuz of low ram me think and not loading some heavy poorly designed web pages.	realistic_swede	t3_5p8cdx

t3_5p8cdx	t1_dcpmnss	1485001869	Good to read some of the comments here... one of my friends just got a 5s a few weeks ago on AT&amp;T Go, has been pretty happy with it. Says everything works pretty smooth &amp; battery lasts him most of the day.	plyboult	t3_5p8cdx
t3_5p9r35	t1_dcpndyj	1485003959	It's happening for iPhone SE only on iOS 10 but for some selected apps, i'm having same problem with messages app.	DALIDB	t1_dcpl939
t3_5p9l01	t1_dcpo808	1485006027	I see little point in waiting to be perfectly honest. We know absolutely nothing about the next iPhone release, so can't comment on that. I mean if people tell you the bezel will be smaller and it isn't, it'll just be a disappointment.    The question really is do you feel you can happily wait another 9 months with your current device or will you feel happier with the iPhone 7 Plus? It's a great device by all means but it's realistically too early for anyone to be recommending waiting on the next release when we know nothing about it. I honestly wouldn't expect the next release to be smaller in the Plus size but that too is speculation.    If you can put up with Samsung for now maybe you should stay but if you want the easier life with an iPhone now rather than 9 months down the line, switch. It would make little sense in my head to wait.	examinati0n	t3_5p9l01
t3_5paodb	t1_dcpol4h	1485006835	Nope, mine unit doesn't have this problem :/ I'm on 6s btw	MacInTosh128	t3_5paodb
t3_5paodb	t1_dcpopsq	1485007110	O get what you mean. For example the landscape button on YouTube is really har to hit. But i think it is not the accuracy it's just that the buttons are small. So you kinda need to learn the hit box.	Scandinavian147	t3_5paodb
t3_5p9l01	t1_dcpqtxa	1485011151	The 7 and 7 plus are going to get software updates for the next 4 or 5 years at least. That and if you're buying through a carrier you can just trade in your iPhone after a year for the newest model. So next January or February you could get the next iPhone. At least on Verizon and att.	PavelDatsyuk	t3_5p9l01
t3_5paodb	t1_dcps0io	1485013134	Personally, also coming from android a few years ago, I found the hitbox of iPhone is slightly lower than it seems on the screen.  Like if you want to hit the back button, you should try to aim a little bit lower than the mid-point of the button.  Let me know if this helps you :)	noctngu	t3_5paodb

t3_5paodb	t1_dcq0i2q	1485024970	Are you using an app or accessing it from a browser? Do these same kinds of problems happen in other apps?  I'm asking because I've owned iPhones four years now, and I've found the touchscreen accuracy depends on either the app or the web page. Some sites like Facebook are horrible with accuracy through Safari, but they work well through their own app.	windstrider13	t3_5paodb
t3_5p9l01	t1_dcq15hj	1485025819	Plus you could always sell the 7+ when the next iPhone comes out and make decent amount of your money back	JadasDePen	t1_dcptu3y
t3_5paodb	t1_dcq1i3l	1485026265	I had a 6s that was fantastic. I took a chance and got a Galaxy s7.  I just recently went back to iphone with a 7 and have noticed exactly this issue. I don't recall having that problem on my 6s but I feel like accuracy is an issue on my 7. My gut is telling me this is force touch related, whether it is an issue with particular phones or the 7 line in general, I dunno. Something is definitely a little wonky with my phone though.	jkslate	t3_5paodb

t3_5phdlh	t1_dcroc47	1485120997	Honestly, this is bluetooth. I had the same problem with two previous pairs of bt headphones with my iPhone 6. Sold both due to it being annoying and went back to wired. Now I'm onto my iPhone 7+ with Solo3 and W1 bluetooth set and have used them everyday for 3 months and haven't dropped once. The range is also a lot better. I moved my back lawn the other day and left my phone on the dinning table and the reception was perfect. I once left home to walk my dog and forgot the Solo3's were connected to my iPad sitting on my bedside table and not to the 7+ in my pocket, it wasn't until I was three houses letterboxes away that the music started to break up and I realised.   TLDR : Bluetooth was shit, now with W1 it's perfect. oh and the battery life!	Cigarcher	t3_5phdlh

Honestly it all depends on what you want the headphones for. Power beats 3 I would recommend them and they are on sale right now on amazon for 149.99 if u want to pay full price. The reason I say the power beats 3 is that they last 12 hours are water and sweat proof and have quick charge. They are good just to lie around in and work out. Now if you want them purely to be around the home only I would go for the beats studio wireless over the ear.	Ivanh04	t3_5pm9g0

Sound is propably better for it's price and they can be used with a wire too if you're out of battery or want a better audio quality.    EDIT: What ever you do, don't buy on-ear headphones.

t3_5po0mt	t1_dcskm42	1485174598	I think Instagram doesn't allow third party clients to even create posts unless it's through the official app so I don't think, if there are any, they won't be much use to you. They may serve as viewers and you *might* be able to like posts but won't be fully functional.	examinati0n	t3_5po0mt

t3_5po4p6	t1_dcslklp	1485176710	I would suggest that you **do not consider** the [Dodocase CARDcase](https://www.dodocase.com/products/leather-iphone-card-case). Bought it directly from them. The leather is wonderful but the plastic case corners on my unit started cracking in all corners and chipping off after less than 3 months.   I contacted their support people who said the plastic is NOT covered in the 1-year warranty (and not said anywhere on their site). If I wanted it replaced, I needed to pay 50% of the new price to have it replaced (plus shipping from and back to the Netherlands), which is poor service and absolute crap.   So, instead of a working case, they have me posting this story everywhere as a warning about their bad business practices.	HollandJim	t3_5po4p6

t3_5po4p6	t1_dcss9l9	1485186878	I've had a society6 case for every iPhone I've had since the 4s and have had no screen shatters or dents in 6 years of using them. They're actually Case-Mate cases. I just bought a tough case for my 7. It doesn't make the phone feel too much heavier or wider, which is nice. It did take a little bit of finagling to get the outer shell to fit properly over the inner bumper, but once I got it on it fit fine and stayed in place. The bumper definitely creates enough of a lip that the front screen will never touch the table if you place it face down, and the camera is protected too. The only downside is that I've only had it on for two days and I can already see the back has gotten scratched up because the shell is a shiny finish, not matte. I got a mostly black design so I think it'll be fine, but I'd take that into consideration if you want to get something more ornate - it might get kind of scratched off eventually. With my old phones I had the slim cases and never had any issue with the headphone jack. No clue how the tough case is with headphones since my 7 doesn't have the traditional jack, but the charging port and volume switch are both easily accessible if that tells you anything.	interludes	t3_5po4p6

Last year around June, Instagram changed their API to restrict 3rd party apps from being able to browse and like posts, it put a few well-known apps out of business so to speak. Even the likes of Flipboard lost their function with IG.

t3_5pp27e	t1_dct0li1	1485196253	I have the same feeling as you do. I found an iPhone 7 at Staples last week in the copy area, so I just waited about 15 minutes and waited for the frantic person running in asking everyone if they have seen a phone. A place like that I feel like I would make sure I gave it to someone like the manager and hope for the best, but other places I have found items I dont trust some of places.

t3_5pqf2r	t1_dct2j88	1485198368	It's been my experience that others always have problems. If you've had little to no problems in the past, upgrade. If you've had problems with many updates, be sure to have a pc or Mac around and use iTunes to update.   My wife for some reason, typically has problems, so we dig out the never used laptop.

It's really sad unfortunately. Most people suck when they think no ones watching.  Edit: Good for you for being one of the good guys. We need more people like you.

t3_5pqf2r	t1_dctemd0	1485211678	No. That's after a major release update, usually, or, sometimes, after a "point release" update (like 10.1 to 10.2). This seems to mostly be a maintenance update with some security and bug patches. It very probably won't do any reindexing like what you're thinking of.	OkToBeTakei	t1_dctakpx

t3_5pr5ve	t1_dctiou0	1485216624	What type of case are you going for? Ultra thin/minimalistic, slim/semi protective or a rugged case?  I like Peel's cases for the first option, as well as the Ringke Slim in SF Black. Caudabe the Veil and Spigen Air Skin I've heard are decent but never tried them.    Apple Leather Cases for the lower end of protection of slim cases, for a slim but more protective case than Apple's leather/silicon I really love the Native Union Clic 360 British Canvas case, looks classy and gets some unique wear over time. Dropped my 6S Plus a few times already with that case from waist height onto concrete once and tile floor twice with no damage to the case or phone(except some white stuff from the concrete that rubbed off and there was only a small scuff left.) Seems nice for everyday usage.   They also have a wooden case with the same design as the Clic 360 but it's snap-on so it leaves the buttons uncovered. That one is also available in real marble which looks pretty cool and the whole marble aesthetic seems to be really popular but it's $90 so not really a good option unless you really really want it, it seems too expensive for a case but everyone has different opinions on that type of stuff.   EDIT:** Just checked the Native Union site, they're actually running a sale right now and the 7 Plus marble case is $71.99, still quite expensive but a slight discount. http://www.nativeunion.com/clic-marble/  Some of Incipio's cases are decent (Rival, NGP, Octane) but the DualPro are thick and the back piece is a smudge/grease/fingerprint magnet that annoys me incredibly.   Spigen's cases are all really nice too for the price. (Neo Hybrid and Rugged Capsule are great.) - Stay away from the Spigen Thin Fit, the Ringke Slim is far nicer. The clear cases always seem to go yellow quickly as well, at least the ones I've had.  Caseology makes decent cases but for that price I'd prefer Spigen or a couple more bucks for the Native Union (which runs $19.99 on Amazon, it's $40 on the site normally but they have a sale so it's the same as amazon - the amazon ones are genuine btw)  As far as rugged I've only used the LifeProof and Otterbox Defender, they were great as far as protection I would recommend them but I'm just not a big rugged case type.   I've tried all the cases I mentioned btw except the Spigen Air Skin, Caudabe and the wood or marble Native Union ones.	9548736	t3_5pr5ve

t3_5pt9l5	t1_dctw7gr	1485233912	Assuming the (AASP) Apple Authorized Service Provider you take it to can only cover things under apples limited warranty, you'll have to pay. LCD fractures don't happen on their own, which means it isn't a manufacturing defect and thus not covered under apple limited warranty. even if the damage to the device isn't cosmetic, there is still a repair cost of $129 plus tax for repair, which is just a display repair not a replacement.

t3_5pp27e	t1_dctxm6c	1485236295	IIRC, there was an issue where you could use Siri to make an emergency call, and then do some button mashing to get out of it and access photos and contacts or something.

t3_5pqf2r	t1_dcu70sx	1485260727	How often do you reboot your iPhone? Rebooting any computer gives yet a slight temporary performance kick. It's not exactly placebo, it's just working with a fresh cache. Old data no longer present etc.  Take all this with a grain of salt as I'm still learning iPhone. I'm just talking about computers in general, which smartphones basically are.	dragontology	t1_dctzjvx
t3_5pqf2r	t1_dcu72pw	1485260850	Glad I'm not the only one with this. Since iOS 10, Bluetooth takes 3x longer to turn on.

t3_5q1up8	t1_dcvmzoe	1485328550	16GB was too little IMO (but was actually enough for me) but 32GB is a good base amount. Unless you're a very heavy user, but for most people 32GB will suffice. I have a 64GB version (55 available, and I struggle to fill even 10GB of that space). You can have quite a good amount of apps, photos, video, etc on your phone and still not run out of space with 32GB, if you're super photo/video heavy there is always cloud storage.	9548736	t3_5q1up8
t3_5q1up8	t1_dcvnkrm	1485329908	Yes, i have 100 gb on one drive because of my galaxy s6, i think im a heavy user, i love to use my phone for games, watch youtube, music, social networks.  How is your battery life on your iphone? I really hate my baterry on my Android, but i think if i get the iphone 7 i could sell it more easily than my s6, thanks!	Bibed	t1_dcvmzoe
t3_5q1up8	t1_dcvnl8g	1485329939	Of course dont sell right now, in like a 1 year or so.	Bibed	t1_dcvnkrm
t3_5q1up8	t1_dcvo1em	1485331056	Yes. You may need to juggle apps or photos off the device every now and then, you certainly won't be able to store your music collection, obviously, but if you stream your music and you're fine uploading your photos to some cloud service, 32gb is more than enough.	fortean	t3_5q1up8
t3_5q0rya	t1_dcvo98c	1485331615	Check the area around the flash, there's a case on. I was actually amazed myself, I was about to reply "no case".  I'm going to buy one of those for my wife's 7, it looks quite nice.	fortean	t1_dcvlm7l
t3_5q1up8	t1_dcvoj4a	1485332360	What iPhone are you getting? Battery life is better on the Plus models. The 7 definitely did improve battery life over how it was on the 6/6s but the plus models still definitely have the better battery life.  On a Plus you can go nearly two days as a light user, a full day no issues as a heavy user and still not have it be near dead.  On the 7 you can probably make it a full day with moderate usage, if heavy it will probably need charging come early night time.  On my 6S Plus, I was sitting at 52% with 5 hours 46 minutes usage and 15 hours standby (unplugged at 6:40 AM more or less, hit 52% at around 10:05 PM) so this phone could last me a whole other day with slightly less usage. I think maybe 3 hours was actually screen usage though, which is still good.	9548736	t1_dcvnkrm
t3_5q1up8	t1_dcvpiw4	1485335131	The normal iphone 7, well i think the battery life is good so, i would love it to have the 7 plus but i think is reeeally big	Bibed	t1_dcvoj4a

t3_5q1up8	t1_dcvw68q	1485351650	That's true. Regular 7 has better battery life than the regular 6/6S did so it's not a big deal anymore. I have big hands and I still feel the 6S Plus is slightly too big coming from my Note 5 that had a bigger display but smaller sized body	9548736	t1_dcvpiw4
t3_5q1up8	t1_dcvx14a	1485353014	It depends on what apps you have and the amount. I would suggest paying for iCloud Drive because it's really cheap for 50Gb. You can backup your documents, photos etc on iCloud.	avEmonsta	t3_5q1up8

t3_5q1up8	t1_dcw1sqn	1485359192	True. I just hate always having the thought in the back of my mind that I paid for the latest phone and got the slowest option even if it doesn't make any real difference. I'm weird like that. 🤷🏻‍♂️	PavelDatsyuk	t1_dcw11cv
t3_5q1up8	t1_dcw23my	1485359538	Yeah I get that! I hesitated getting the 32gb because of that but it's so much faster than my 6+ that I forgot about it. I know what you mean though, I'm like that too.	enragedbreakfast	t1_dcw1sqn

t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcw54b3	1485362884	Well how would we know unless we were developers?	MyDongIsSoBig	t1_dcvzpo7
t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcw5bgs	1485363095	Because every new feature adds complexity, so when developing software, the developer has to choose which features to implement based on how many people would use it versus how many would be confused by it (along with many other factors).  In this case, Apple decided that not enough people would need a passcode on Photos to justify its addition.	connor_g	t3_5q2wg3
t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcw6vfq	1485364799	There's plenty of questions about Apple's design choices that require you to be a developer to answer.	SEND_ME_SPIDERMAN	t1_dcw54b3

t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcw88f0	1485366263	There are quite a few people who would use it and the complexity is not that high. I think it is more a case of not fitting with the Apple philosophy. They never allowed porn and other stuff that you'd want to hide. They want you to sync your photos to all devices to create a seamless experience.

t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwbny5	1485369899	I wouldn't be so sure that complexity isn't high. A feature that might seem simple can be very complex when you actually try and make it work.  You could potentially be looking at a snowballing effect requiring major rewrites and redesigns of fundamental parts of the operating system, which in turn could break hundreds of thousands of existing apps.	zeldn	t1_dcw88f0
t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwc2hi	1485370319	Exactly. Every second app can access photos in some way. This would definitely become a nightmare for accessing a coded photo library.	optmspotts	t1_dcwbny5
t3_5q4zip	t1_dcwdak6	1485371633	Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Storage &amp; Usage &gt; Manage storage under storage &gt; and see what is taking up space. Chances are you'll find your problem there. Have you tried backing up your photos to the cloud or dropbox? Maybe that could free up some space on the device. Also, possibly change your messages to delete after 30 days.	gunner940	t3_5q4zip

Now there's always 300 "releasing soon" jailbreaks that get teased, before one actually gets released after Apple has released 2 more iOS updates.

t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwiuz7	1485377578	So, I got to ask, what qualifies you to make these assessments?  what information do you have?  How many reports to apple have there been requesting this feature?  What quantity of users even utilize passcodes (indicating they may have an interest in this)?  What are the plans for handling apps that consume the camera?  What APIs will need to be made available to developers to prevent stack traces when they try to access the camera and cannot?  I mean, you made a lot of statements like you know exactly what's going on but I'm not confident in that.  maybe you're an engineer at apple or some exec but I find that hard to believe.	puterTDI	t1_dcw88f0
t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwiw6g	1485377614	This is a nice workaround, thank you. I still wish we could lock any app as part of the privacy controls (blocking location data for example).	AutoGeek3000	t1_dcwhje7

t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwjw8c	1485378685	You forgot to delete it from the recently deleted photos folder. And of course, this all just hides the photo from a casual person. The photo would likely still be retrievable by someone with the right capabilities.	freediverx01	t1_dcwhje7
t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwk0lb	1485378811	&gt; the complexity is not that high  That's the assumption from someone unfamiliar with the complexities of properly designing secure systems. A company like Samsung would be happy to rush out this feature while neglecting to implement it in a way that was secure.	freediverx01	t1_dcw88f0
t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwk4qi	1485378935	The first question would be whether the photos would only be casually hidden or whether they were expected to be truly secure. Then they'd have to figure out a way to make the implications obvious to the user. And that's before writing a single line of code.  Apple already provides a hide option for photos, although they messed it up royally by showing hidden photos in the All Photos album.   The OP is asking for passcode protection though, which suggests he's also asking for some sort of secure encryption that could not be easily defeated by anyone who had access to the unlocked phone. This is likely impossible with iOS's current architecture, in part because even though the original photo might be encrypted, copies of it might still be retrievable. This is why Apple has focused on full disk encryption. There is no current way to securely hide/delete data from a volume, because solid state memory can have bits and pieces of your files scattered all over the place and it's impossible to delete all traces of deleted files.  The only way to secure it is by encrypting the whole thing, and that encryption disappears the moment you unlock your phone.  The new APFS is supposed to improve the ability to encrypt files or folders separately within an fully encrypted volume. But I don't think that will address the issue of secure file deletion, which is currently only possible by having encrypted the entire drive prior to creating the file, and then securely destroying the encryption key stored in a special type of memory.	freediverx01	t1_dcwc2hi
t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwk8iz	1485379048	If you're jailbroken there are tweaks to let you lock apps with a password or Touch ID. I know that's not the point of this thread but it's worth knowing.	thatmffm	t3_5q2wg3

t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwkqkv	1485379574	Common sense does.   Your questions are mostly irrelevant. How many percent of the users change the cookie settings in Safari or enable the Do not track-header? Still it was decided to add these features. I dare to assume that there is demand for a lock feature on the basis of people looking for it on the internet and installation numbers of apps that provide this functionality.   Did I indicate I had plans for that? In fact I believe I made it clear that I had not, because pass codes for photos would go against Apple philosophy imo. I believe with "preventing stack traces" you mean preventing crashes? Well, if you thought about it for a minute, you would realize that apps do handle denial of permission for the camera, so that would not change.   Anyway, what I was referring to, when I said that the complexity is not that high, was showing a lock screen before opening an app. Of course unforeseen side-effects depending on the implementation can always happen, but in general I would not rate the complexity for this high. If you want to password protect pictures instead of just the pictures app, that of course is an entire different story.	zackline	t1_dcwiuz7
t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwl0hz	1485379867	Furthermore, why aren't hidden photos actually hidden? They still show up clear as day in the hidden album. It should be a Settings option that hidden photos not be shown at all in the app unless you change the setting to show them.   In the end, I think it's just Apple's subtle way of telling you to buy your kids their own device. iPod touch starts at $200 and the iPad mini starts at $250. Plus by now, at least for me as a long time Apple user, I've got plenty of hand-me-downs for other to use.	Takeabyte	t3_5q2wg3
t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwl7lr	1485380076	Most parents hand their phone off to their kids to use like to play games or watch a video. Not much stopping a kid from hitting the home button and doing what they please in the Photos App.	Takeabyte	t1_dcw8yva

t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwlcem	1485380219	my questions were coming directly from a decade of experience as a software engineer and they are questions that need to be answered and coded for if you're going to password protect the app.  I honestly asked it because your statements screamed to me of someone who doesn't actually know about software complexity and views any feature that is easy to describe as not complex.  The fact that you think they're irrelevant shows that you don't really have the knowledge to make this statement:  &gt;  and the complexity is not that high  You also made this statement:  &gt; There are quite a few people who would use it  Then directly contradicted yourself when you said this:  &gt;  How many percent of the users change the cookie settings in Safari or enable the Do not track-header? Still it was decided to add these features.  You literally  just based your original argument on how many people would want it then when I asked you to justify the assertion you tried to act like it was unimportant.  It's pretty clear YOU want this and you feel that means everyone else should.  it's also clear you have no idea what the complexity is.  I even see the value in this but I think it's ridiculous to try and play armchair jokey without understanding everything involved.  It's very easy to sit there and say "this is easy and they need to do it" but if you're even willing to back up your own statements when push comes to shove then it's clear it's more complex than you realize.  Edit: also, those questions were just the ones that popped to mind with very little thought.  I have no doubt that there is way more complexity that would be discovered with just a few minutes thought and even more were a team to dig in and begin implementing it.  The point is that users love to say "this is a simple feature" because they can describe it in a few sentences then the standard reaction is to disavow ever saying it when it turns out it's way more complex.	puterTDI	t1_dcwkqkv

t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwn1ev	1485382034	What?  I think you are interpreting that wrong. I don't want this feature. I think Apple does not implement it since it would affect seamless usage of photos in general - for example Cloud Sync, or the picker, like you mentioned - in general it also is not really in line with Apple.   I think I already made it clear enough which complexity I was referring to.   And to spell it out for you again: there is reasonable demand for features in that direction. It's just that you make it seem small by setting it in relation with the total user base, that is why I mentioned other features that do have their uses but will generally be used by a small minority of users.  And about me backing up my statements, that's also quite funny for you to say, where are the answers regarding your flawed statements about stack traces?   If you are neat picking, I will be too. If you so desperately want to make this a battle about who has more knowledge in this field in a passive-aggressive way, then so be it. I admit that I am not always right, but I do think that you are not as knowledgeable as you like to appear here either, judging by your initial post.   To me it seems like you first of all disregarded that permissions for the camera need to be handled already anyway, which makes me believe you don't develop mobile apps for either iOS or Android. Also, you talk about preventing stack traces, which makes about as much sense as preventing the airbag in a car accident. This leads me to doubt that you have decades of programming experience.  Anyway, it could as well have been a simple misunderstanding between us. We don't know each other. But I think we now know what we meant and I think we actually agree in the important points - namely that locking the pictures (as opposed to showing a lockscreen when opening an app, like the apps that allow you to do that on Android) would be complex to implement and certainly not worth the effort.	zackline	t1_dcwlcem
t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwn9xc	1485382300	Yeah, no. There are like 4 or 5 jailbreak apps that let you choose to put either a fingerprint or passcode lock on a select of of apps. And 3 of them have at least been around since iOS 7. If regular, developer-on-the-side people can come up with these, I'll bet my left kidney and lung that Apple's devs can.	svk7	t1_dcwbny5
t3_5q2wg3	t1_dcwnf0t	1485382458	I am not talking about securing pictures. What I was referring to was showing a lock screen - I think we agree that this would not be of high complexity as it it demonstrated by banking apps, for example. I know that you are talking about properly securing the data. Indeed that would highly complex with many side-effects you'd have to consider.	zackline	t1_dcwk0lb

t3_5qie9x	t1_dczh6qx	1485539185	If you can wait 8-9 months then go ahead. If you don't want to wait that long, the 7 is an awesome phone.  Also, your phone might be eligible for a free battery replacement. You should check that with apple though	dwltz	t3_5qie9x

t3_5qie9x	t1_dczkua9	1485543213	I don't see anyone else mentioning this. But if your only problem is the batter, those phones have a recall on battery. I would call Apple and see if your phone is eligible for a replacement. (The recall should still be valid even if its out of warranty.)  Either way I suggest waiting for the next one though because it's supposed to be a decent update. But before until then i would look into the free replacement.	Sherlocked_	t3_5qie9x

t3_5qhts8	t1_dczm5gp	1485544673	I made the same switch (s7 edge to 7 plus) about a week ago. Main reasons were battery life and quality of apps. The s7 edge was a fantastic phone but I hated not knowing how long the battery would last, some days it would be great and other days it would be awful for no reason. I was endlessly resetting the phone and force closing apps to try and alleviate this but I shouldn't have to do that. It's true what they say about iPhones, THEY JUST WORK.	joepreen	t3_5qhts8

I was also a nay sayer about not having a headphone jack is no big deal.... its been an inconvenience quite a few times.

t3_5qie9x	t1_dczuk68	1485554352	I'm not sure myself because this year is the 10th anniversary of the OG IPhone so maybe Apple has something different planned? I don't really like to follow the rumor mill anyway, at least this far in advance of when it would be released.	chippinganimal	t1_dczk4gj
t3_5qie9x	t1_dczwoyh	1485557079	Depends on how long you can use a phone like that. I sunk $35 into a battery case from Ali Express last July to offset my iPhone 6's poor battery life, and with that I can absolutely make it to the iPhone 8.  I strongly considered getting the SE or the 7, but I feel like I'll be more satisfied this coming fall.	paligror	t1_dczh8bc

t3_5qie9x	t1_dczwr9j	1485557160	I'd wager we get a special "iPhone X" this year to mark their 10 year. If they don't do some special branding, they're missing out on their own party	paligror	t1_dczljas

t3_5qie9x	t1_dczxpkc	1485558404	Considering how well they did this year with iPhone 7 and whole note 7 fiasco, I am highly suspicious they will rush for a new gen iPhone. Market is in their favor and they have never been so confortable in the market in a while. They need to make some minor improvements, improve Siri and some features here and there and its done. Being 10 year anniversary doesnt mean anything at all. They might make some gifts for 10'th annieversary for their customers but dont make unrealistic expectations. ￼	Rubikh	t1_dczt7vp

t3_5qie9x	t1_dd021ix	1485564510	I intended to wait for the next gen, but the battery on my 6s+ was sucking as well. Also, I wanted to change to the regular sized one. So the opportunity came and I got the 7. Very happy with it. I'm in love the taptic engine on this one, I think this feature hasn't been discussed as much, but it's amazing.  If you're upgrading on a two-year plan, then definetely wait for the next gen. If not, then I'd say go ahead	Plastilina_Ve	t3_5qie9x
t3_5qie9x	t1_dd0239j	1485564581	i have the 7+ and don't regret it at all even if the iPhone 8 or X comes out this year. The design doesn't seem appealing to me from the rumors because it just looks like a ripoff of a galaxy now.   The 7+ battery lasts long as fuck with medium to even heavy usage for me. Along with the water resistance, dual cameras, 3GBs of RAM, stereo speakers and A10 Fusion chip would be enough for me to upgrade(the speed difference will show in time during future updates ime). I even prefer the taptic home button better because I've had the regular ones break on me before.  Fucking get it	topfinesser	t3_5qie9x

t3_5qlt7w	t1_dd0hmsv	1485594822	I've heard a story that goes like this:  the original SIRI team was a super talented group of folks doing work that was way ahead of the curve.  They had a roadmap for future development and improvement that in hindsight would have put them far ahead of all the other services because of how early they were to the game.  Part of that road map included a microservices-based approach to integration.  Basically, SIRI has a common service API that allows it to reach out to many different types of services, which are governed by agreements between Apple and external providers probably in an app store developer type model.   Story goes that Steve Jobs did not agree with this approach, he believed in the "walled garden" for the product—that apple should crete and curate a set of actions for SIRI that were closely quality controlled, and more importantly completely governed by Apple.   So the original team of super talented folks bailed, and are now the minds behind a popular technology that powers some of the personal assistants popular today. SIRI essentially sat dormant and abandoned for a long time, while other products began to emerge in the personal assistant space.  I don't doubt that they're working furiously to put something market-leading together, but they are definitely in the position of being far behind in an area where they were once a thought leader.  Sometimes you have to play with the other kids on the playground. Or, outside the walled garden?  I'm not great with metaphors.	jeremylee	t3_5qlt7w

The next big update to Siri will be out sometime toward the end of this year (probably with iOS 11) and will be more akin to a completely new rebuilt Siri 2.0 than just a feature tweak.

t3_5qlt7w	t1_dd0lwdj	1485609160	My guess is that there are multiple stages of processing the voice input (some on the phone, and some on a server somewhere) and the on screen display of the input as text isn't the last one. Some later stage, probably off the phone, 'corrects' the input further, and inadvertently gets it wrong when the stage at which it was displayed got it right.   It's still bad, but not actually insane.	sprashoo	t1_dd0du3u

t3_5qhts8	t1_dd0u4z9	1485623807	Welcome to the club The battery thing you are a experiencing(2% drop in 45min)  is a pseudo effect.   Let me explain: your battery in phone is actually above 2900 mah(may be even more than 3000) while the ios is bound to report the percentage out of calculated portion of  2900.   Check this [app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battery-percentage-your-device/id1122320041?mt=8)  The affect will die out with wear and tear. But you don't need to worry about that.

t3_5qpe27	t1_dd11eyo	1485633841	Not sure if trolling... But I use both iOS and Android, so here's some information:  &gt; To me it seemed like a completely unfinished product.  &gt;Doing anything was a pain in the ass. I had to have 2 different apps for voicemail and calls.   If you are using Google Voice as your Voicemail (I do this), then you only need Google Voice. If you are using an app from your carrier, then i can't help you. If you are using regular voicemail you don't need an app, the phone will tell you when you have a voicemail and dial your voicemail for you when you want to hear the message.  &gt; Google voice is a mess.   While the product hasn't been updated in ages, it works a lot better on Android than on iOS.  &gt; I couldnt send SMS from my computer without an additional $10 app.   There is no iMessage on Android, and iMessage is not SMS. Hangouts works from any device, so you could use that (it's what I use for most of my messaging). You could use whatsapp like every where in the world except the United States, but I'm not sure if there is a desktop interface. You have options, and none of them cost money.  &gt; I couldnt sync my music library without an additional $10 app.  Drag and drop your music to the phone. It is much easier to move music, ringtones, alarms, notification sounds, etc on android than on iOS. No fees or apps needed. If you want to "sync" your music. Install Google Play Music on your phone and on your computer. All music in your music folders are now available on your phone. This is also free.  &gt; The list went on and on. Texting and typing were years behind the iphone too.   This comment is what makes me think you must be trolling. Keyboards on Android are orders of magnitude better than they are on iOS. Data input on Android is vastly superior to iOS.  &gt;I used it for 1 day, trying to figure everything out, and am returning it to Google. I have no idea why anyone would pick a $800 pixel over the iphone. At that price point I expect a finished product where someone else has figured out how to do everything.  Return it. You wanted an android phone that is exactly like an iOS device, and when it wasn't, you gave up **in a day**. It took me a lot longer than a day to know how to do a lot of stuff on iOS after only using android for 5 years. You won't even help yourself by searching. You see a music syncing piece of software for ten dollars and assume that's the only way. Go back to an iOS device that you already learned and are used to. Change isn't always easy, but your views on Android are whack.   Sorry for being so blunt.  Edit: [OP made a thread asking for assistance with the Pixel](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/5qkpbs/having_a_ridiculous_amount_of_trouble_switching/)  Every post in that thread by OP is downvoted to hell, so make sure you expand collapsed comments. It is clear that OP is either trolling in two places at once, or has no intention of actually learning or using any apps other than those they used on iOS.  Please return the phone OP.	DeathKoil	t3_5qpe27
t3_5qpe27	t1_dd11pmk	1485634261	What two different apps for calls and vm? The only one Ive seen is the dialer app. The one with the phone icon. To check voicemail, just hold down the "1" button on dialer, or click on the vm notification. Unless you mean the carrier specific visual voicemail app.   Sync library from where? If you have it on your pc, just copy/paste, anything, unlike ios.   Typing is a lot better on the gboard. Better suggestions, better autocorrect, and has swipe typing. You can even change the color of the keyboard and choose to show key borders or not. Dont see how texting is behind, sms/mms works the same way on any phone, even flip phones.   If youre trying to use the extra stuff/services like hangouts, allo, ect then yeah it gets confusing. Dialer and messaging is the meat and potatoes.   I haven't used the pixel, but have been using android for the past several years, just coming to iphone this past month. I like android but the pixel is a butt ugly phone imo. The black version isnt even black, that quirky glass on the back, huge bezels make the front look like a cheap Moto G, and the wedge shape. I wouldn't get one for those reasons, but android itself is a pretty solid os (i only used 'stock' android or cyanogenmod, fwiw). Personally I think the OnePlus 3 is the phone to get over the Pixel, if 5.5" doesn't bother you.	rouyal	t3_5qpe27
t3_5qpe27	t1_dd126sl	1485634922	I have been a loyal iphone user for the last 5 years but I am fed up with apple/ios now. I really like the pixel and android and what it can do. Google now is excellent. Siri, is rubbish. I like that google now will pull my delivery info from emails etc.	willismac	t3_5qpe27
t3_5qpe27	t1_dd12cxx	1485635156	&gt;What two different apps for calls and vm?  One was the default phone app, the other was the visual voicemail app for AT&amp;T.  Then I tried google voice and hangouts, which can all do things with your voicemail.  I ended up getting very poorly transcribed voicemails texted and emailed to me.  Worst part was that it just displayed the number of the caller who left the voicemail and not their name, even though they were in my google contacts.  &gt;Sync library from where? If you have it on your pc, just copy/paste, anything, unlike ios.  Copying and pasting is not syncing.  Copying and pasting is what I did for my first MP3 player in 1999.  This is 2017, there should be way better music management available by default.  &gt;Typing is a lot better on the gboard.  lol.  my wpm was about 1/3 of what it is on the ios keyboard.  I could tell the digitizer on the touchscreen was way less optimized than the iOS one and caused a lot of errors.	PoopandReddit	t1_dd11pmk
t3_5qpe27	t1_dd12k1v	1485635433	I moved from Android to iOS recently but this is nonsense.  I moved because iOS runs better, gets battery life kills, hardware on iPhone is flat out nicer than any Android device including Pixel, and support is way better.  iMessage kills standard SMS for sure, and Pixel was obviously rushed on hardware side, but everything else is bullshit.	servvits_ban_boner	t3_5qpe27
t3_5qpe27	t1_dd12lmn	1485635494	Nice detective work.  Really impressed that you went through my post history and found it necessary to link to it..... really?  yeah I was asking for advise because I dont see how so many people could like Android so much when it sucks so bad.  So I was trying to see if people actually knew how to do the things I wanted.  Turns out they dont.   I dont have as much time as you do to go through your reply point by point.  All Im going to say is that iMessage absolutely allows you to send SMS from your computer.  I know its though your phone, but whatever.  Google doesnt have anything close.  Hangouts only works like that if I pay $20 to port my number completely to voice.  You are just like everyone else posting all these workarrounds and shit.  its a $800 phone.  Someone should be figuring this shit out for me and providing me with the basic tools I need.  You seriously think dragging and dropping music is acceptable at that price point?  Thats how I got music on my first MP3 player in 1999.  That shit should be automated full featured syncing and it should be wireless.  And the only way shouldnt be to upload my 60GB to the cloud.  That is retarded.  I dont want google's cloud involved in everything I fucking do and there is no reason for it.  You better believe that shit is in the box and on its way back to google.  Sorry for being "whack".  Fucking goober.	PoopandReddit	t1_dd11eyo
t3_5qpe27	t1_dd14gi2	1485638062	So you're either trolling, or have no idea what you're doing to the point of it being comic relief.  Not sure which, so I'll just explain and hope it's the latter.  &gt;One was the default phone app, the other was the visual voicemail app for AT&amp;T. Then I tried google voice and hangouts, which can all do things with your voicemail. I ended up getting very poorly transcribed voicemails texted and emailed to me.  If you're going to use Google voice for your voicemail, you don't use AT&amp;T's voicemail app.  End of sentence.  Full stop.  Google voicemail REPLACES your AT&amp;T voicemail.  If you're going to bitch about getting texts and emails for incoming voicemails, you might want to go into your Google Voice settings and disable some options.  I know they're confusing, so I linked you a picture to show you what to look for [here](http://i.imgur.com/2ACK5NY.jpg).  Very confusing, I know.  &gt;Copying and pasting is not syncing.  No, it's not.  I know more people who would like drag &amp; drop than would EVER want to use iTunes, which is a buggy POS.  But here, enjoy:  http://www.mediamonkey.com  It's a nice program for your desktop, for free, that syncs your Android phone.  Know what also works?  Windows Media Player.    Here's what a google search pulled up:  http://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/477-music-manager-desktop-android-ios-sync.html  But hey, feel free to try to...  what?  Whore karma by bitching about Android on an iPhone subreddit.  I'm sure it's very productive.	TIFUbyResponding	t1_dd12cxx
t3_5qpe27	t1_dd14jb5	1485638173	Hell, even the S7 (once you get Nougat) is a terrific phone.  I'm trying to give the iPhone a fair shot, but Android keeps pulling me back lately.  We'll see.  Both are great OSes, depending on what you prioritize.	TIFUbyResponding	t1_dd10e7f
t3_5qpe27	t1_dd1fc0g	1485653273	This is 2017, and I still copy/paste media to my phone (well, when i was on android). You still didnt answer where you are trying to sync from. There isnt a music management app because its not an mp3 player from 1999. But if you want that, theres loads of free applications for PC and Mac to do what you want. My first google search 9/10 free: https://tunesgo.wondershare.com/mobile-phone/top5-android-sync-manager.html  You put those voicemail/phone apps on there and confused yourself. The phone didnt do that. It came with the dialer and google messenger. Thats all you need, unless you want visual voicemail, which i will admit is better integrated in iphone.   My wpm went way down when i switched to this iPhone 6s. Mostly thats what happens till you get used to the layout of a new phone. I constantly hit the wrong letters, but I don't blame it on the digitizer, lol  I think you just got a shock from switching to a new os. I got the same thing after using android for years then buying an iPad. I felt nauseous using it and returned it. Then got this iPhone, felt the same way, but stuck with it. Android has a lot to offer, and googles apps are better than Apple's IMO (i.e., drive, keep, calendar, photos, ect). Google offers 15gb storage, and unlimited photo storage (up to 16mp i heard). The Pixel may show the best of Google, but I think the OnePlus 3 is the best of android. I just cant deal with android phablets anymore so thats why I switched.	rouyal	t1_dd12cxx

t3_5qsqr2	t1_dd1t74c	1485675842	If I am keeping a phone for two years and will not break the screen (I always use nice cases that even if dropped won't allow a shatter), do you think paying the $130 up front will be worth it?

t3_5qsqr2	t1_dd1tbes	1485676134	If after the first year, phone has hardware failure of bottom mic, cellular issues or no power, button or wifi/bluetooth issues all of those require a whole unit which is 269+ depending on the model	907229	t1_dd1t74c

t3_5qsqr2	t1_dd1ti4c	1485676597	Correctly, because if you purchase AppleCare plus, you would get an extra year of warranty which would naturally cover hardware/software issues.	907229	t1_dd1tegt
t3_5qsqr2	t1_dd1z4ve	1485692997	If you bought applecare, any damage to the phone will only cost you $99 for a replacement. If you break the screen, $29.	Heyyitsmesusan	t1_dd1tegt
t3_5qsqr2	t1_dd1zov2	1485694541	AppleCare+ also covers included accessories, such as the EarPods or lightning headphone adapter, provides phone support if you should have any software issues, and Express replacement service so if you certain mail-in repairs Apple sends you a working device overnight first, then you return the broken item.  The turn around time for mail-in repair is often faster than waiting for an in-store a point entirely.	Kelsenellenelvial	t1_dd1tegt
t3_5qsqr2	t1_dd24n76	1485704509	AppleCare does not cover battery replacement. That would be out of pocket regardless since it's a "consumable".  However, AppleCare does protect against things you can't control like the issue I had this week where my wife's iPhone 7+ rear camera just stopped working, and they had to replace the phone. Apple covers these things for a year without AppleCare, but you're on your own for the 2nd year. As an example, this issue would have needed a full replacement which is priced at $299 (ouch!)  The cost of AppleCare+ vs. other monthly insurance plans for accidental damage is actually pretty cheap at ~5$/mo with a very low deductible ($29 for screen, $99 for everything else)	umkvec	t3_5qsqr2

t3_5qv2fb	t1_dd2jej4	1485724309	Narwhal didn't use 19% of your battery. It used 19% of the 25% that are used (since you have 75% left), so 4.75% of your battery. Same for the other apps.  What you can do is scroll all the way to the bottom in that list. If you see that Time since last full charge "standby" equals "usage" you know that some app is going wild. Usage time should always be (much) lower than standby time. If it's not, something is not letting our phone go to standby (could be an app or a system process). Also check your background app refresh settings and only enable what you really need.  Battery drain and recharge will do nothing. A restore might help. I had the problem too, the other day, and it was because of faulty hardware (GPS module).  You said you did nothing with thep phone, though - wasn't Strong active (i.e. on screen) for 50 mins, and narwhal for 12?  I happen to be at 75% right now, too, and my "Usage" time is 3h 7min and Standby is "6h 6min", also on an iPhone 7.  Either way, you should use Gym Hero instead of strong, so PM me and I'll send you a promo code for Gym Hero Pro :-P	affenstall	t3_5qv2fb

t3_5qv2fb	t1_dd2kqsd	1485726024	Pretty sure the beginning piece is false. The battery section of the settings app does not show the current battery cycle, it shows the last 24 hours.

t3_5qxucs	t1_dd3fo1l	1485777615	The old thirty pin port got easily three times as much lint packed into it, and the pins were much more fragile and prone to bend and become useless upon cleaning. The lightning port is a better design.  Source: I clean people's dirty iPhone ports for a living.  (Can't speak to microUSB; my PS4 controller never gets any lint in the port, but it's too big to keep in my pocket.)	MisterFizzster	t1_dd3b159

t3_5qxucs	t1_dd3h9e6	1485781332	I went to the store to check it out, a basic worker comes with some sort of small pick and takes out SO MUCH DUST and lint out of my charger.

I know that the Facebook app was the culprit because after I deleted it I haven't had that experience again.

t3_5qxucs	t1_dd3mwh4	1485790320	Funny—I just performed this maintenance on my iPhone 6 yesterday after reading another Reddit post recommending using a paper clip. I was uneasy about using metal, so I used a wooden toothpick. I couldn't believe the amount of lint that came out including a piece of debris.   It's no wonder the charger wasn't staying plugged in. Too bad I suffered through months of poor charging only to discover such an easy fix. Looking into my port, I hadn't seen anything unusual, so I assumed it wasn't gunk build-up.   Sad thing is, I had even gone in to see an Apple "Genius" who recommended a $300+ iPhone 6 replacement, or the purchase of a brand new iPhone 7. I left there dismayed and went another month with poor charging before trying the tooth pick.   Now, my phone is like new again!	realist-451	t3_5qxucs
t3_5qxucs	t1_dd3n544	1485790626	Haha you say Best Buy. I work there and I asked my friend who is geek squad to do it and he got a staple and did it with that.	Antartic_Camel	t1_dd3jhag

t3_5qxucs	t1_dd3sex9	1485796885	Yeah that happened to me on my iPhone 5. Probably never cleaned it out ever, started doing that and I cleaned it out. Also a decent pea sized amount of lint in there. Now at least one a month I try and clean out my ports with compressed air.	taboo007	t3_5qxucs

t3_5qxucs	t1_dd3ths8	1485798082	A few years ago, my iPhone 4 got to the point where it would only charge if I rubber banded the phone longways to hold the charging cable in the correct position.  Then one day it wouldn't charge. At all. So I frantically ran back-ups and made plans to get it replaced, hoping the ~20% of life it had left would get me through it all.  Well over a year after getting the new phone, something prompted me to remember the 4, so I revisited it. And spent quite some time with a staple scooping lump after lump of pocket lint out of the port. (The staple was flimsy enough to not damage anything on the inside of the phone, I reasoned.)  The phone worked perfectly after that, and I was able to use it as a trade-in to get a 6 for free.  Lint hasn't been much of an issue for me since the Lightning cable was introduced. Nowadays, it just seems like the off-brand Lightning cables are just so prone to failure after a few months of usage. :\	BrazenlyGeek	t3_5qxucs
t3_5qxucs	t1_dd3tvua	1485798513	Do the same for the headphone jack! My stock earbud's mic was cutting out a lot during calls and so I dig out the jack with a paper clip and got a ton of gunk that was preventing it from seating fully. Earbuds work fine now. I have to do this about half as often as the lightning port, but it's still important!	justaguy394	t3_5qxucs
t3_5qxucs	t1_dd3u7ct	1485798859	Don't know why you got downvoted.  It's always a bad idea to use something conductive.  You're asking for your phone to get shorted.	I_Love_McRibs	t1_dd3gr93
t3_5qxucs	t1_dd3w388	1485800950	I seriously wish I thought of this a few years ago. I bought so many chargers thinking it was that....took my phone to the Apple Store and an employee quickly told me it's the lint buildup. Boo. I've got an Otterbox Defender case, so it seals the port up nicely. You'll still have to clean it from time to time.	guitarwrassler	t3_5qxucs
t3_5qxucs	t1_dd3x74j	1485802179	I literally just tried using a paper lip, got a bunch of stuff out and now my headphones snap in like they used to!	waterpolo122	t1_dd3q1gx
t3_5qxucs	t1_dd3yjt8	1485803731	The telltale sign is when the charger doesn't go in all the way and make that click sound. 9/10 times you can help give birth to a lint baby.	quintsreddit	t1_dd3slvr
t3_5qxucs	t1_dd3yjx3	1485803734	I had this issue with my 5s and was so pissed that I got an old Galaxy S4 to try out android. Turned out that I liked the iphone better (but I also learned that if I ever switch, there's no real way to get out of iMessage cleanly - outside of getting a new number).  When I got tired of android I thought "hey I should clean that port" and now I use my 5S again	CombTheDessert	t3_5qxucs
t3_5qxucs	t1_dd3yo95	1485803872	I'm so sorry they recommended a new device. You can tell it's lint because the back of the port has a speckled look instead of the normal metallic look. Glad you were able to get it yourself! :)	quintsreddit	t1_dd3mwh4
t3_5qyssc	t1_dd404o8	1485805470	iPhone has the ability to respond to 'hey Siri' so surely by definition that means Siri is or could be always listening?	PGMG17	t3_5qyssc
t3_5qxucs	t1_dd4173f	1485806654	Another useful method is to take a small plastic wrapper of some sort (think candy wrapper (no sticky candy residue on it of course), or a CD wrapper) and take a side of it, folded into a point a few times almost like a paper airplane. And use that to dig around in there. I find that the plastic can make a good fine point but as long as you don't over fold it, it's soft enough to not harm the contacts. Just be careful.

t3_5qyssc	t1_dd430dx	1485808660	That doesn't say they're actually doing it, in fact they said that people "thought Facebook was listening in, but Facebook had denied it". You're spreading misinformation based on nothing.	AWildSketchIsBurned	t1_dd3j9ka
t3_5qxucs	t1_dd43946	1485808927	I wonder if this might be causing my "device may not be supported" when I try to use my authentic apple charger at home for my iphone 6S Plus.

t3_5ra8im	t1_dd5lxcj	1485889881	Works fine for my wife who seems to use it for a lot of surfing. I don't think the games thing would be an issue either. When I switched from android to iOS the biggest thing is how apps seem to be optimized for the phone much better. Maybe it's the standard hardware making it easier for app developers but in general the iphone is unlikely to choke on any app you get from the App Store. That said, I'm a firm believer in getting the best that you can when you go to buy, any reason you're avoiding the 7?	MrMischiefVIP	t3_5ra8im
t3_5ra8im	t1_dd5lxqv	1485889893	Yes it does. App open still quick. Battery life will worse than the 7 but overall I think it is still good.	duchung95	t3_5ra8im

t3_5r6oj6	t1_dd5nclq	1485891448	I haven't read the comments but I'll give you some things (I came from a Note7 to 6S Plus)  On the keyboard, you can apply pressure to move the cursor in the text box  I upload my photos to Google Photos for unlimited uploads  In iMessage, you can apply pressure to the send button to turn on sending options, such as laser.  I disabled my press to unlock on the home screen so I could just press the home button from sleep mode to unlock it.  I also accessed the camera options in setting and enabled 1080p 60fps for good looking videos.	kims681	t3_5r6oj6
t3_5ra8im	t1_dd5no91	1485891795	Without a doubt, I think the 6s can last another year. I would honestly consider the 6s Plus if you're going to get one just for the added battery, 1080p resolution, and the OIS.   My 6s Plus still flies. I rarely experience problems with my day-to-day usage, which is something I loved coming from Android as well. My battery lasts all day with heavy usage and will last for more than a day if light usage. I'm currently on 10.3 Beta 1, and everything is super smooth.	shmangit69	t3_5ra8im
t3_5ra8im	t1_dd5npwz	1485891843	The A9 in the 6S still smokes 99% of last year's Android flagships, so I'd say it's a pretty safe purchase. I'd expect there to be 3 or more years of software updates for the 6S.	PavelDatsyuk	t3_5ra8im

I know android users don't see it at first but when you really need to get something done you will find them. Photo app press a little harder on a photo it will open to a bigger view.

Even took it into the store and had the battery replaced under their "unexpected shutdown" battery replacement program. Took my phone off charger at around 8:30 am. It is now 3:53 pm and I'm at 34%. I made two 20 minute phone calls and did some web browsing, but I guess it's my fault for using my phone too much. /s  Just out of curiosity, why not the 7? Lack of headphone jack was my reason for not upgrading but I'm curious what other people's reasons are.	Baekbeom	t3_5ra8im

t3_5r9l4r	t1_dd5ti1t	1485897994	That's a choice you make when you jailbreak.  no judging, I've considered jailbreaking myself but chose not to because I wanted to get updates and I wanted the stability of a non jailbroken phone.  The fact is though that if you jailbreak then you make sacrifices on some things and gain on others.  It's not apples job or fault if the jailbreak community doesn't get a bug fix right away	puterTDI	t1_dd5nyrh
t3_5r9l4r	t1_dd5u0uj	1485898543	I had to endure this "joke" also. But what I did was simpler, I had Messages in my mac, I deleted the message there, and my phone worked again. hope it helps someone	escK	t3_5r9l4r

t3_5ra8im	t1_dd5w32z	1485900733	The 6s is a perfectly fine device. U should get a little more life out of it compared to any device before it's time due to the fact it has 2GB of RAM	scapegoat81	t1_dd5mfrb

t3_5r9l4r	t1_dd5yv65	1485903965	The link you posted loads 14 ads from Google.  The asshole is collecting revenue by hosting this page. This technique is very likely this is against Google's TOS.  1.

t3_5r9l4r	t1_dd60eg0	1485905863	The ads didn't really affect me at all, and to be completely fair, the page, script, or whatever he has on that page *did* fix my issue, so honestly, I would gladly be willing to generate ad revenue for him.   At one point I was sure I was going to have to call Apple to have them help me.	SySTeMaT1c	t1_dd5yv65
t3_5ra8im	t1_dd66ous	1485913691	Definitely still keeps up and will be good for a few more years. Take a look at 6S vs 7 videos on youTube. Obviously the A10 chip on the 7 is better but it isn't so much faster than the A9 that it makes more sense to get the 7. If you get the 6S now you can wait until the 8 to upgrade. or 7S if you want, but either way the 6S is still a great device, better than Android phones from the same year (2015) today	9548736	t3_5ra8im
t3_5ra8im	t1_dd66sji	1485913813	The A9 chip on the 6S/6S Plus can hold it's own against 2016 Android flagships, and is definitely better than the 2015 flagships (Note 5, LG G4, HTC M9, Galaxy S6, etc).  Plus you're getting at least 3 more years of updates, whereas Android flagships from 2015 all started on Lollipop (except the 6P) and are dying on Nougat (2 major updates is the most these companies give to their flagships *usually*)	9548736	t1_dd66ous

t3_5rdnfg	t1_dd6hhpf	1485928758	You can put the SIM card in the phone.

t3_5rbbhq	t1_dd6hs9v	1485929320	It's outdated technology. The record sales prove Apple made the right decision, despite the media frenzy around it. Seriously, it's time to get over it or switch to a device that embraces old tech.	RedHerringxx	t1_dd6g06x

t3_5rdnfg	t1_dd6ivff	1485931564	If you listened to the voicemail via your iPhone you should still be able to access it via the voicemail part of the phone app. You can then tap the message and then click the box with the arrow coming out. This will let you send it via email or iCloud Drive or something else to save it forever.   Good luck!	isellchickens	t3_5rdnfg

t3_5rbbhq	t1_dd6liej	1485938303	Doesn't really matter if it's the same look as long as the new device is faster, lasts longer, and includes some new features/specs. Plus most people like showing off that they got the latest iPhone.	mysticportal	t1_dd6hryr

t3_5rbbhq	t1_dd6pqvo	1485951317	I think there's a general confusion between the (minority) of users who say that apple is doomed (most of these in my opinion are actually users like yourself who say it sarcastically) and those who voice their frustration with the direction that Apple is going.  Same with the people who were annoyed with the new MBPs, their annoyances are still valid and just because sales show that more people are buying the new MBP, doesn't invalidate their opinions.  It just shows that they have to adapt or choose another option.	santaisafraud	t1_dd5zckp

t3_5rdnfg	t1_dd6sf89	1485956830	Call Verizon ASAP. Customer service MAY be able to salvage it for you. If Tier 1 grunt says no, ask for Tier 2. If Tier 2 says no, try 3.   The higher you go, put more weight on the answer. Tier 1 is mostly billing questions, and basic account things. They don't get access to the good toys that would let them do this.   Used to work for AT&amp;T ~9 years ago. Had access to Tier 2 applications as a retail store employee (not sure why or how), I could send text messages as AT&amp;T, access VM accounts, and a number of other things I wouldn't have thought possible.   Not sure as to Verizon's backend but I would imagine they have something similar?	ajfili	t1_dd6s543

t3_5rdnfg	t1_dd6t5sa	1485958028	Apple uses their own voicemail system independent from any carriers, so check on the phone itself too. Open the phone app, browse to the voicemail tab, and select the voicemail you need by tapping one time on it. When the expanded or more detailed view opens you should see a share icon. Then you can mail it to yourself or use your preferred method of sharing.	borkthenork	t3_5rdnfg
t3_5rdnfg	t1_dd6tsp1	1485958984	Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately after the switch, all of my prior voicemails were no longer available in the Voicemail tab of the phone app. It was completely empty. :(	guyute2588	t1_dd6t5sa
t3_5rbbhq	t1_dd6u3tw	1485959437	I did not upgrade to '7' because of headphone jack. I use it everywhere. I really hope they bring it back in iPhone 8 and until then, I will keep using my iPhone 6s.	winphan	t1_dd5zckp
t3_5rbbhq	t1_dd6udh2	1485959812	Hate to burst your bubble, but the iPhone 8 will not have a headphone jack. The coming Samsung phones won't have a headphone jack.   The headphone jack is old tech. Use the adapter that comes with the phone, or switch to wireless headphones.   The latter is so much better than a 60 year old piece of tech in my brand new device, which is what the headphone jack is.	WeatherWrestlingGuy	t1_dd6u3tw
t3_5rdnfg	t1_dd6uibm	1485959997	Just got off the phone with Verizon. What they tell me is that I would have to temporarily port my number BACK to Verizon, and then they could see if they are able to retrieve the vmail, but it is not a guarantee.  Does this sound legit to any of you guys? I'm concerned about porting my number back to Verizon and THEN having to port it BACK to T mobile.	guyute2588	t3_5rdnfg

t3_5rdnfg	t1_dd6v1qf	1485960729	Heylo, I think you should try a Backup Restore program, such as Dr. Fone or such. Their are others but I know with Dr. Fone, it will pull up data that has been deleted for quite some time from ur phone,  U should give it a try, Ive done this with videos I thought I saved and it found things on my phone that I deleted along time ago, and then u just save it and do what u wish. it does all content	GranKai	t3_5rdnfg

t3_5rdnfg	t1_dd6vnpk	1485961526	Sorry to hear that. Your only chance of getting the voicemail back is if you backed up the phone to iTunes and restore from there.  Neither Apple nor your carrier has the content.	takemusu	t3_5rdnfg

t3_5rbbhq	t1_dd6xdh5	1485963648	Sorry but that is just a clueless response.   The S8 will very likely have a headphone jack. Samsung has no incentive to remove it like Apple did (to gouge consumers/manufacturers for Lightning port royalties). Just because the headphone jack is old does NOT mean it needs replacing. The power outlets in your home are an old design, yet they work perfectly fine, don't they?   Wireless audio quality will never match that of a cabled connection. Using the stupid adapter is no different than having another damn hole on the phone for the headphone jack, except now, you get to deal with losing the adapter, breaking the adapter, and dealing with a sub-par quality DAC/amp inside the tiny adapter for poor audio quality. Oh, and if you don't have the adapter with you, now you're possibly inconvenienced by not being able to hook into a stereo somewhere to play music, and you can't go with a cabled connection and charge the phone at the same time.   Wow, such progress. Much advancement. It was a worthless compromise.	Nitemare3219	t1_dd6udh2
t3_5qhts8	t1_dd6xkui	1485963890	Yeah of course, battery degradation is still a thing unfortunately.

t3_5rbbhq	t1_dd6zeb2	1485966017	Sounds like very specific use cases to you specifically. It DIDN'T work for me just to provide some annecdotal information into the mix.

t3_5rbbhq	t1_dd70kal	1485967324	I'll eat my metaphorical hat if Samsung doesn't ditch the useless headphone jack by next year. USB-C dude. Get over it. Apple was just ahead of the curve. Use wireless, use the adapter, or use a shittier old device. Stop the bitching. It's not a problem.	WeatherWrestlingGuy	t1_dd6xdh5

t3_5rbbhq	t1_dd70pvg	1485967495	The lack of a headphone jack is only a problem when you make it a problem. Otherwise, it's perfectly fine.   When I get my new iPhone this weekend, I will not have a single problem with there not being a headphone jack. Why? Because I have already switched to the current standard of headphones. Wireless.

t3_5rdnfg	t1_dd71ids	1485968358	Hey, Verizon tech here. There's a small chance that we have a voicemail tree for you. It doesn't always save, simply because of the server that iPhone voicemails are stored. http://cbwproductions.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=1 can recover voicemails on occasion as well. You should definitely give it a shot. Best of luck ❤️	bhink11235	t3_5rdnfg

t3_5rdnfg	t1_dd71pl2	1485968579	I posted a link below to a company that can restore sometimes and put them on a cd or something for you. I work advanced tech for Verizon, and if the number is fully ported out we can't even access the tool that allows for voicemail restoration. I have a feeling if you talked with tmobiles port center / even like reached out to their social media team (who are very good about the odd requests) they can help you with getting your number back to vzw for a bit. There's also a winback department at Verizon that might be able to make it a bit easier, if you just request that when you call	bhink11235	t1_dd6uibm

t3_5rdnfg	t1_dd728xx	1485969182	Former Verizon Tier 2 here. When a line is disconnected the voicemail gets dumped. Sometimes that dump is permanent but sometimes it gets held in a 30 day pending deletion system. You have a better chance of it only pending if your Verizon bill cycle has not ended yet as technically your line isn't fully disconnected until your next bill cycle date after the port out. You will need to reactivate that line with Verizon  (port back) as that pending system is only accessible to techs on active lines. Tier 2 will then need to check if the voicemail are available as a calling tree number for you to access. If teir 2 cannot access them then they will need to submit an NRB ticket. You cannot be transferred to NRB as they dont accept incoming calls from customers, NRB will contact you back within 3-5 days, possibly sooner, to advise you if restoring the voicemail was successful.

t3_5rbbhq	t1_dd72sau	1485969767	Wireless is not the standard. It's for people who prefer convenience (lack of wiring), but also inconvenience (charging), and worse sound quality. There's a reason my Sennheiser HD 800 S headphones cost $1,700 and are WIRED. There's a reason my Shure SE846 IEMs cost $1,000 and are WIRED.	Nitemare3219	t1_dd70pvg

t3_5rbbhq	t1_dd730wl	1485970027	I don't want to use the garbage EarPods that come with the phone.  Bluetooth lacks sound quality, but is acceptable to me for in-car listening (usually).  I use wired IEMs in the gym, and in my winter/rainy day vehicle, it lacks Bluetooth audio, so I have to use aux. So that's 2 adapters (gym and car) that I need. I'm fine with that and leaving the adapters plugged in. But it's still an unnecessary inconvenience. It is no different than just leaving the damn headphone jack, because there are still plenty of people like me who are using wired connections, for good reason. I don't want to deal with connection drop outs, worse sound quality, or recharging another device.	Nitemare3219	t1_dd6yqu7
t3_5rgfqf	t1_dd734le	1485970137	I would be very interested in getting a code as well to check this out! Looks great   Edit: spelling...	RadicalRascal	t3_5rgfqf
t3_5rbbhq	t1_dd737qc	1485970229	I did not make it a problem. Apple made the problem by needlessly eliminating it. They removed 1 port, and people will still used wired connections via Lightning... so in essence, NOTHING has changed. It was an unfriendly move, and Apple's "reasoning" behind it is pure garbage. Maybe they really didn't have the room in the device for it. Maybe they just wanted to profit even more from Lightning. Maybe both. Either way, it was a terrible move IMO.	Nitemare3219	t1_dd70pvg

t3_5rbbhq	t1_dd754iz	1485972284	If you're paying that much for headphones, perhaps you should listen to audio on a computer with more high end equipment.   But, instead you're on the internet complaining that a device doesn't have 60 year old tech in it.   Phones this year and on will not have the jack anymore. Get over it.	WeatherWrestlingGuy	t1_dd72sau
t3_5rbbhq	t1_dd76f0y	1485973671	A computer by default does not have better equipment. To me it sounds like you don't know much about audio hardware, so I'm not sure why you're pushing so hard to drop the headphone jack when you lack the knowledge to make a sound judgement.  I'll be sure to revisit this comment in 2 months for the official S8 announcement showing a headphone jack (leaks already do have it). I'm sure the Pixel won't be dropping it anytime soon, either.

So I have to wonder why someone would not just do this straight away, or at any time in the last couple of years. I am also fairly new to iOS as I just got my first iPhone last April (however, I am rather technical, as when using Android for the last six years, I experimented with all kinds of custom firmware).  While this little anecdote might not help, anyone out there who has voicemails on their iPhone they want to save, use the share button (box with up arrow) and email it to yourself. Then stick it in all your clouds (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive), put it on a flash drive and put it in a safe with your deeds and shit, etc., etc.	dragontology	t3_5rdnfg

t3_5rm4ae	t1_dd8ci9x	1486035694	Of all the backhanded stuff google does, their phone shuffle is what drove you away? Well whatever gets people away from them I guess.  Also it's not on anyone to convince you. Try it and see. I was on windows phones for four years before my first iPhone. Since then our entire house has switched to an apple device house. They just do it right. Privacy focused, seamless design integration between software and hardware, it is the best digital experience on the planet.	huskiesHTT	t3_5rm4ae
t3_5rm4ae	t1_dd8ckfe	1486035856	Eh, a lot more drove me away, but their movement to make running a stock OS a premium feature is the straw that broke the camels back. It's not like I can go pick up an Android phone from AT&amp;T and unlock the bootloader. I mean, a few of them can be, but my selection is heavily limited. I'm sure that's AT&amp;T's fault and not googles..directly, but google still allows such nonsense.	geokhentix	t1_dd8ci9x
t3_5rm4ae	t1_dd8ckkk	1486035866	I've always used Android devices in the past but switched to the iPhone 7 November last year and asked myself why I didn't jump ship earlier.   After years of boot loops, wake locks, random app crashes and reboots, shit ported iOS and second rate apps, poor support and customer service, lack of updates etc. I decided I've had enough.   After switching, life has been so much better. The device is so stable and consistent. Never worried about apps crashing or failing on me. They also get regularly updated and look way better than their Android counterparts.   Google apps are surprisingly way better, designed and efficient on iOS.   Battery life is miles ahead.   File manager? Nah, I don't miss that.   Customisation of home screen? Ain't got time for that. In the past, I kept on switching my home layout constantly only for it to look like shit the next day rinse repeat.   Headphone jack? Not a problem for me with quality Bluetooth headphones with W1 chip.   Touch ID is the best iPhone feature imo. It works all the time and makes securing both apps and the phone much better.   3D Touch is another sweet feature on iOS.   I also like this display better than oversaturated Amoled screens.   That's all I can say for now as it's endless	Un-trollable	t3_5rm4ae
t3_5rm4ae	t1_dd8cqrp	1486036326	I switched to an iPhone 5s 2 years ago, then went right back cuz I hated it. I switched again last year and I've been okay with it. iOS has been more bearable with third party keyboards and they make it easier to share things between apps.  Battery life is much better though, you don't have to spend time babying it way too much. My phone sips battery if I don't use it. Totally different experience from my old android phones, where the phone uses a ton of battery whether you use it or not.  And iMessage is nice. Almost everyone I know has an iPhone so that makes it a better experience.	Yo_2T	t3_5rm4ae

t3_5rm6mz	t1_dd8d7ci	1486037485	&gt;Now, I've heard rumors that it may be a RAM issue (I'm still on a 6 Plus) and that the 6S or 7 may not have this issue because of their increased memory, but I'm having a hard time believing that since the rest of the system works flawlessly.  It is partially a ram issue. I believe the keyboards are restricted to the amount they can use and it's a small amount.	unabatedshagie	t3_5rm6mz
t3_5rm4ae	t1_dd8dd5i	1486037856	I've been pretty much strictly Android since the OG droid. I would try out iPhone for a few weeks every year thinking maybe this year I make the switch. I've tried the 4s, the 5s, and the 6, but they never really did it for me and I'd go back to Android and the Nexus line.   I decided to try again with the 7+, I've been rocking it since September and haven't thought of switching back at all in that time.   iOS does some things differently so there is a bit of a learning curve but I don't regret selling my 6P one bit.   I've jumped head first into the ecosystem; iPhone 7+, apple watch, apple TV, and Mac (really a hakintosh but it works the same).	phulton	t3_5rm4ae

t3_5rm4ae	t1_dd8ff8y	1486042041	Been an android guy since 07 and  picked up a 128 gb 6s this past sunday (needed headphone jack and was cheaper) and couldn't be happier. Everything just works. Sure the customization was endless on android but I grew tired of having to find an app to fix this or that or root to fix others. From inconsistent battery life to google not really staying committed and lacking a focus on apps (all their different messaging apps, constantly changing the name of chromecast apps) it all just started to become annoying. Even with apple's last gen flagship I still feel the camera and processor blow away current android phones, aside from the pixel and galaxy phones. Everything just works and apple's focus on security and ability to provide patches and updates to justify the price made it a worthy decision	y3sp	t3_5rm4ae

t3_5rm4ae	t1_dd8jqo9	1486048216	Although new android phones may be good, I used androids upto the year 2012. I was fairly satisfied but them I was also into new ROMs and tweaks and such things at that time. But in 2011. I got my wife an iPhone 4 (used) as this was first dive into Apple's world and I was hesitant to spend more money (even for used) at that time. So she started using the iPhone 4 and was supremely happy with how good it was (she came from old button nokia phone). I also started using her phone to play around with it and it quickly grew on me. The ease of use, no fiddling with ROMs and such things, jailbreak which made many wonderful things possible. I was sold. Next year i got myself a 4S (used), iPad 2. I got my dad (technologically not so good) a 3GS.	iphone4Suser	t3_5rm4ae

t3_5rm6mz	t1_dd8kd7j	1486048984	This is correct. If I'm not mistaken is was set to only 25MB. If you are jailbroken, you can change this limit. I changed mine too just 50MB and I do feel the differences mainly keyboard opens faster!	CRush3RIII	t1_dd8d7ci
t3_5rm4ae	t1_dd8ki0p	1486049145	Been a year since I switched over and I freaking love it!   I've been on the fence since I realized I don't really use many of the customization features that makes Android amazing to use.   Plus the ease of use for iOS and the way better quality of apps really helps (even if I pay for most of them).   I miss some things I can only do on Android - such as a decent file system for files (Really hope that changes in the next version of iOS- I would kill for a way to access my files)  Battery life has also been decent for the most part - I can last 1.5 days without a top up for the most part  Also, god bless Touch ID - Since i'm already in the Apple ecosystem - it just simply makes sense for me. Payment's are a breeze, and so is 2FA .  One other gripe is that I wish that 3rd party keyboards wouldn't be as buggy as the stock kb.   Other than that- hop right on, I promise you wont miss much.	brainintraining	t3_5rm4ae

t3_5rmo3l	t1_dd8p474	1486054360	Tristar IC went kaput. Not uncommon. &lt;- This is only true if you plug in a cable and no charging indicator comes on screen and pressing and holding the power and home button for 30 seconds then power for 5 seconds does nothing.  There are shops that will replace it, costs about 70-100 depending on the shop. If eligible for an upgrade, then upgrade, otherwise the repair might be worth while.  I have used microsoldering.com with great results and fast turn around time, I just sent one in for the same exact repair. Had a backlight fuse replaced by them as well on another phone.	thinkdifferentlolz	t1_dd8g3jf

t3_5rm4ae	t1_dd9ce6l	1486080744	I moved from a Nexus 5 that I'd been using since release. I won't be going back to Android soon, almost identical reason to you too - I want a stock experience and am not paying for a Pixel.   I really like iOS. I spent ages customising Android, and would spent so much time trying to micro manage my apps for battery life, both these are not needed on iOS (at least for me). There is also the "it just works" factor that is kind of hard to explain. As gimmicky as it sounds, 3D Touch is something I can't live without, it so fluid that long press is just inconvenient. The Taptic Feedback is also really underrated, scrolling through the times for my alarms to weirdly satisfying. App support also seems to be much better here, though I've only installed a few, so my experiences is limited.	LlamasAreLlamasToo	t3_5rm4ae

t3_5rtejy	t1_dda3o9k	1486131927	Anecdotal report here. I have 4 people in my family, we all use Lifeproof or Catalyst cases for about 2 to 4 years. The Lifeproof and Catalyst cases have both been great at surviving drops and falls, no question. My iPhone5 survived a bike crash in a Lifeproof case; although the case itself was damaged, the iPhone remained in like-new condition. My daughter still uses the iPhone5 (in a new case).  I've found that the Lifeproof cases last roughly a year and a half, maybe 2 years if you're lucky, before they start developing cracks in the soft rubber areas and peeling apart. When that happens, you have to buy a new replacement case. Also, I find that unscrewing the headphone jack port is inconvenient, especially if you use the headphones a lot.  I have switched to Catalyst case for my iPhone6 and my son's iPhone 5s. The headphone port is a rubber plug; it doesn't screw, you just pull it out. Easy-peasy. On my own Catalyst case, the bottom gasket did wear out after a year or so, but I replaced it for $5 instead of buying a whole new case. The rest of the case is in great shape after about 20 months.  The Catalyst case also has a connector to hold a lanyard, which I don't use, but some might find useful. Personally, I find the Lifeproof case to be more attractive than the catalyst (but ultimately I am more concerned about protection than appearance).  So my verdict: Lifeproof good, Catalyst better.	kickstand	t3_5rtejy

t3_5rsueh	t1_ddapo0y	1486157218	Is there a method to get specific stats?  If not I would say I was mostly on 4G LTE yesterday but I'm usually connected to school/home wifi	masterYodaOG	t1_ddap43t
t3_5rsueh	t1_ddapube	1486157419	Yeah most days I do about that, but I mean as long as you're happy with it, then it doesn't much matter. I notice deleting Facebook does a good job of preserving my battery life. Both because I don't go on my phone as much and because the app sucks.	bloohens	t1_ddakhdn
t3_5rsueh	t1_ddb4441	1486177021	Yeah Narwhal is the best. I use constantly throughout the day and the background activity at most is 2%.	avEmonsta	t1_ddakf7b

t3_5rzodj	t1_ddbejf5	1486199374	If I were you, I prefer to wait the 7s in September. I am using an iPhone 6s, not bad, but just like that.	Andylikecat	t3_5rzodj
t3_5rsueh	t1_ddbewk9	1486200628	Your iPhone won't tell you, you only know by your wireless &amp; cellular usage. And 7h 3min is good for 7 plus and you still have 31%.	DALIDB	t1_ddapo0y
t3_5rzodj	t1_ddbeye3	1486200798	I agree. No reason to upgrade right now unless you have a lot of disposable income. If you do, go for the 7. The 6s has the exact same hardware as your se, for all intents and purposes.	fortean	t3_5rzodj
t3_5rzodj	t1_ddbfqv9	1486203669	Definitely a 7.  If you can't wait until 10th iPhone comes out.	DALIDB	t3_5rzodj
t3_5rzodj	t1_ddbfzjq	1486204534	doenst worth the upgrade, already have a 7 and it´s full of bugs, I´ve bought the SE instead, 6S is a little big for me and it´s more 200€ ..it s to much money,Iphone SE is the best iphone ever	diogorilho	t3_5rzodj
t3_5rzodj	t1_ddbgkgk	1486206642	Why definitely? I think they're almost exact same phones (minus the water resistance and missing jack). If anyone is considering 6s vs the 7 - go with 6S.	majnus	t1_ddbfqv9
t3_5rzodj	t1_ddbgngl	1486206935	If you really wanna go for a 6s I'd suggest trying to buy it used or at the lowest price possible so in September you can sell it and not shell out too much cash for the 7s.	Yo_2T	t3_5rzodj
t3_5rzodj	t1_ddbgrpc	1486207355	I know that iPhone 7 won't change your daily usage but for the future and compatibility I'd suggest the 7 over 6S, water resistance is not a primary thing in iPhones cause no body is gonna put his personal iPhone in water just to test it's resistance, camera is a little bit better they added a new layer to improve colors &amp; depth effects and performance wise the 7 is more powerful than a 6S but as i said it's not going to change your daily usage. So the wisest choice is a 6S, i said 7 because money difference is £100 which is not a big difference so i'll still say 7 is better than 6S at this time if he can't wait for next iPhone.

Is it happening frequently?	pmrr	t3_5s05n3
t3_5s05n3	t1_ddbip42	1486213439	It's the sensor which detects which sensor has failed /s	NotSwedishBacon	t3_5s05n3

t3_5s05n3	t1_ddbjfpy	1486215227	It appears that you may need to recalibrate some sensors. Apparently there is a way to do this within the Compass app.   http://www.macworld.com/article/2055384/how-to-recalibrate-the-motion-sensors-in-your-iphone-5s.html   &gt;You can try to fix...by force-quitting and relaunching Compass to trigger the calibration screen, and you’ll have the best luck if you calibrate at least several feet away from any other magnetic or electronic devices  Let me know the result.	Notcow	t1_ddbhakn
t3_5rzodj	t1_ddbkrss	1486218003	That's why i recommend 6s over the 7, because 7 features are insignificant. Better camera...Maybe slightly. Don't even get me started on performance. Have you ever put 6S next to the 7 and actually tested the performance side by side? No? I did, because I have both at home. Lo and behold, the 6S running iOS 9 is MUCH more faster than the 7. I mean, literally twice-as-fast-boot-up faster. I do realize 7 is better hardware but in reality it means nothing. You won't see any difference whatsoever. 7 is actually one of the most disappointing iphones ever made. By no means I'm not saying it's a bad device, it's just disappointing. IPhone 6s is as powerful and comes with well optimised and nicely designed ios.   Apple fucked up releasing a device that brings nothing new, additionally on an ios with poor UI that's not optimised at all and just wastes all the power the 7 has. The only reason I ended up with the 7 is black color which I love and 128GB which I love even more. Other than that, I would never recommend this phone over the 6S, ever.	majnus	t1_ddbgrpc

t3_5s05n3	t1_ddbpsow	1486226119	It's common to use these as references to a string localisation file. If for some reason the file is not included, then the references are used instead. Very easy to overlook unfortunately as the compiler doesn't flag it up.	squarefrog	t1_ddbigb7
t3_5rzodj	t1_ddbpz9s	1486226376	Isn't it only the 7 Plus that has OIS?   And I'll add that I used the SE for a while and got tired of the smaller screen.  The 6S is very nice and the battery is almost the same as the SE, for me.  The 3D touch is great.  Haven't used the 7.	gapost	t1_ddbpm77
t3_5s05n3	t1_ddbq4jl	1486226576	There's a good chance these are keys for an I18n/L10n file that is filled up by someone else for localization.  Chances are whoever was supposed to fill out the localization file didn't do so.  Developer did the right thing here.	ChadMoran	t1_ddbjd9z
t3_5rzodj	t1_ddbqlrq	1486227210	No, the regular 7 has OIS. The regular 6s does not while the 6S plus does. The 7 has the same camera as the 7 plus minus the second one on the back.	PavelDatsyuk	t1_ddbpz9s

So to answer your question, yes, I don't think it's one of the "Killer features" iPhone's are known for.	CHarrisMedia	t3_5s1vij

t3_5s1vij	t1_ddbyz01	1486238579	I don't think Siri is a draw for anyone today. Maybe when it was first implemented by Apple there was a buzz around it but I think it more or less disappointed the masses. Today I don't even think people are considering Siri in an iPhone when we have strong competition from the likes of Alexa and Cortana.    But I do think it will be more of an issue going forward. Not necessarily in the next 2-5 years but I think as we see personal assistants being adapted into technology (for use in cars, home appliances, etc) Siri could become make or break for some. Especially professionals. The technology is moving forward and Siri seems to be left behind.	examinati0n	t3_5s1vij

t3_5s1vij	t1_ddc5njf	1486248027	I don't think Siri is a deciding factor for most. It's an enhancement to the function of the phone.  I think you ask this question because you think Siri isn't useful and I agree with you. I wish Siri was as good as Google Now is... Siri's voice recognition is often painful to use so I dont use it.  I used Google Now all the time because voice recognition and overall functionality was amazing and would do what I asked on the first try. It would even spell words for me that I barely knew how to pronounce... Siri... Well, ask her to navigate to "Ulta"....	TrnDownForWOT	t3_5s1vij
t3_5s1vij	t1_ddc5qro	1486248152	I use Siri too much. I'm not sure why people don't use it. She can read your texts, reply to texts, start navigation to a certain place, call places without you having to search their number. Lots of possibilities all without touching your phone! Will never buy an Android all thanks to Siri.	AvoidMySnipes	t3_5s1vij
t3_5s1vij	t1_ddc5y9u	1486248444	When Siri came out people went nuts for it.  I also remember my girlfriend (now wife) couldn't get it to understand her no matter how hard she tried.  Not in english, not in spanish, EVENTUALLY in German I believe, and she has no accent whatsoever.  Me personally? I never use the thing.  I never used voice commands on Android, I never use them with Siri.  I also have a ton of friends (who all use iPhones) that SWEAR by Siri and voice commands.  I think that while the enthusiast segment gave up on it, the general public who are tech illiterate just love the feature.	TIFUbyResponding	t3_5s1vij
t3_5s1vij	t1_ddc63dt	1486248640	Siri isn't great on iPhone compared to its competitors. on Apple TV, it works pretty great for what you would use it for on that platform. I think with all the competition on the mobile platforms, Siri is losing.	teedoff087	t3_5s1vij

Use a small suction cup to the bottom portion of the screen and pull the bottom half of the screen out first and then the rest being very careful to not tug on the cables inside the phone.  Reinstall screen by first tucking in the 2 white tabs at the top of the screen first and lower the rest of the screen and snap down.  Screw back in the 2 screws.  I don't think the frame is bent but if it is just careful bend back straight.  You can do it !!! 😲👍	salzamani	t3_5s2nnm

Don't try to snap the top back in without removing the 2 bottom screws because the 2 tabs at the top need to slide in first.	salzamani	t1_ddc7swp
t3_5s1vij	t1_ddc8ef3	1486252009	Me neither, although I weirdly use Alexa on my two Amazon Dots constantly, and it's virtually the same target audience. I think it's something about being able to just speak out loud wherever I am in my home without having to first pull my phone out of my pocket before I start asking a question. I also find the trigger phrase "Hey, Siri!" adds significant awkwardness compared to just starting my own sentence with, "Alexa, ...".	solinvictus21	t1_ddbv1my

t3_5s4wi1	t1_ddcdfmj	1486259275	I think the black in general was a great decision by Apple. I have the matte and it's held strong. No noticeable scratching difference from my girls rose gold. Buddy has the jet black and can't take it out of the case because it scratches so easily. I'm sure I've looked at it wrong and scratched the coating at some point. Anyway, rambling. Matte black FTW	dgree049	t3_5s4wi1
t3_5s4wi1	t1_ddcdrk3	1486259744	It's slick but only very slightly more than the iPhone 6s. The jet black is pretty slick to the grip. It's not unbearable but I would drop it without some sort of case. I usually don't have a case on my phone anyway.	dgree049	t3_5s4wi1
t3_5s4wi1	t1_ddce2sg	1486260181	I had matte black for a couple of months and the only thing I noticed was that it would get kinda greasy.  I've had the jet black 7+ for about 2 weeks now and absolutely love the color/feel. I don't use cases (only a leather one when I'm going out to a club or something). Finger prints all over the place and little micro abrasions you can only see in certain lighting situations and angles.	bryanhandsome	t3_5s4wi1

t3_5s4wi1	t1_ddceysp	1486261494	My jet black plus is holding up really well. I had an Apple case on it since day one but then ordered a Predator aluminum frame to be able to show it off more. The frame is great at protecting the most commonly scratched or marked parts and allows the shiny black to show through. It's easy to hold by the sides, too.   All in all, I'm really happy with how the finish is holding up and expect some light scratching as a normal part of having a phone.  No ragrets	netpastor	t3_5s4wi1
t3_5s1vij	t1_ddcf1om	1486261615	I rarely ever use Siri. I really wouldn't miss it if Siri wasn't on the iPhone anymore in its current implementation.   The problem with Siri and most of these assistants is that you never know the limits of the system. Any other application with a touch interface or GUI, you have a clear map of what you can and can't do with the application right in front of you. With Siri or anything similar you're just taking stabs in the dark at what it might be able to do... and it often disappoints. It cannot learn to do things and the experience is often just frustrating if you say something in a way it's not expecting, even if it's able to do it. Often times, companies are also trying to push features or functionality into a different UI paradigm that is less efficient and already has an excellent interface that doesn't need to be supplanted by some new gimmick. I hope this all changes as time moves on, but I personally hate talking in the first place... to people in general. I certainly don't want to talk to my electronic devices. The ideal UI would be thought control. All existing UI's to date are far to slow to interact with and are constantly in our way. We know what we want to do and can think it far faster than speaking it, typing it, clicking, tapping, etc. That will be the next and ultimate revolutionary interface, whenever it becomes a reality...

t3_5s4wi1	t1_ddchkim	1486265429	Matte black holds up real well. Though it does get water spots easier when it gets wet. No big deal. I modified my iPhone 7+ with a glowing apple logo. Used 9 LED's and the baby shines bright like a diamond. On sexiness level, I'd say it's on par with the Note7. Also got the IQ Shield matte screen protector, so when the phone is off, the front looks like the back.	loganluther	t3_5s4wi1

t3_5s4wi1	t1_ddcj5gv	1486267908	The jet black is a beautiful phone but man is it hard to go nude because anything gives it a micro scratch. If you go jet black, just know you will always have it in a case.	Bigchile123	t3_5s4wi1
t3_5s1vij	t1_ddcj79g	1486267989	100%.  Siri and her near complete inability to understand my accent (I've got a strong Scottish accent) plus how bad Apple Maps is here in Scotland have been the two things stopping me from switching over to an iPhone completely.    Alexa can understand me most of the time, and Ok Google is near enough perfect, but the vast majority of the time Siri hasn't got a clue what I said.	SanStarko	t1_ddc7fi4

t3_5s4wi1	t1_ddcmwzf	1486274362	If you are going to use it without a case, go for the jet black since it's much more grippier. If you are planning to use it in a case go with Matte black since even with or without case jet black is going to get scratched. Only reason I would get the jet black is for the grippier feel and initial hot look.	kbtech	t3_5s4wi1
t3_5s4wi1	t1_ddco5hm	1486276798	My matte black looks just like new. I've never had an issue with the grip when the case is off. It's just nerve wracking using an expensive phone without a case.

If the solution I posted solves the problem, great, was just a problem with the Compass app.   If it doesn't, back to looking for solutions. Maybe his phone storage is going bad.

t3_5s4wi1	t1_ddcsnq2	1486289819	I got the jet black because it reminded me of the 3GS (my first smart phone). I'm one of those guys that doesn't like using cases and I have to say, this phone suffers for it. I bought the 7 and after two days decided it was too small and took it back to get a plus. To this fay I am honestly shocked they even took it back as even after those two days it looked like it had been through a war.. My Plus is now about 4 months old and from a distance looks fine, but up close it is scuffed to all hell. Can post some pictures if you would like!	_TR-8R-	t3_5s4wi1

t3_5s1vij	t1_ddcu7c2	1486295223	I use Siri a fair bit, mostly for convenience. In the car, hands free calls and messages. Setting timers when cooking (hands get wet or dirty), setting reminders and to do lists.  That's the gist of it, I find Siri unreliable for anything else.	scrat72	t3_5s1vij

t3_5s6b84	t1_ddcuys5	1486297774	The 7 doesn't get a multi mode unlock unless it is the sprint/Verizon version. Otherwise it gets a GSM unlock.  The 6/6s both have GSM and CDMA bands and therefore get multi mode unlock, not just a single unlock type.  The GSM version of the iPhone 7, like the one for att will never work on sprint or Verizon. Ever. Their modems are made by Intel, and Qualcomm holds the patents for CDMA in the USA.	OptionalCookie	t1_ddctbj0
t3_5s6b84	t1_ddcv3vp	1486298209	I suggest to ask politely to switch the model.  Don't day anything about switching to Verizon. State that your signal has been extremely poor in the places you travel to whereas with your other iPhones (name drop the 6/6s even if you never had them because they have Qualcomm radios). You read an article about the different radios in the iPhone 7, and are extremely unhappy with the Intel radio and would like a model with the Qualcomm radio instead. You are experiencing issues like poor data and when you switch the sim to your 6/6s, it seems like you are on the internet super highway but it just slogs along on your 7.  Some people have had success with that and swapped their Intel radio models for a CDMA compatible Qualcomm version under warranty without comprising their iPhone upgrade program eligibility. Because the poor signal is true. You aren't telling a lie.  Pay off the iPhone, or request a carrier unlock. I think phones in the iPhone eligibility upgrade program are automatically unlocked, but check that and get back to me.  Remember to take a look at Apple.com/iPhone/lte for the Verizon sold model on the page. Idk the model numbers off of the top of my head for the 7.	OptionalCookie	t3_5s6b84

t3_5s6b84	t1_ddd4px7	1486315818	This isn't quite true.    You have to pay a minimum of 6 months towards your current contract before upgrading. As OP says that he is using the 7, he can upgrade to the 7 plus.    He will have to pay extra for the early upgrade and his monthly bill will reflect any price change in the phone.  When he sets up his new contract he can do it on whatever carrier he wants.	Marvelkicks	t1_ddcrzi9

t3_5sb2sc	t1_dddoxrg	1486342753	Improved camera, new colors (jet black/matte black), better home button IMO (solid state, uses haptic engine and less chance for mechanical failure), "improved" screen, ("" because I've compared and never saw any difference really - maybe 7 is a little brighter), A10 processor, water resistant. Basically that's it. If any of that is big to you, upgrade. Otherwise I'd hold out for the 7S this year, honestly the 6S/6S Plus are still great devices, much better than the android flagships from the same year and IMO on par with the ones from this year in most areas.	9548736	t3_5sb2sc
t3_5sb2sc	t1_dddp3n8	1486342957	There are probably hundreds of articles on Google and thousands of videos on YouTube explaining this, but wide colour gamut display, bigger Taptic Engine, A10 Fusion processor, no headphone jack, dual speakers, solid state home button (doesn't physically move), f1.8 camera. Probably a few things I missed but yeah that's most of the big changes.	TheUkrainianGnome	t3_5sb2sc
t3_5sb2sc	t1_dddp5sx	1486343030	I literally upgraded yesterday. It is so much faster. Less bugs, and the OS runs so much better as a whole. I'd recommend the 7 to anyone. The haptic engines take a bit to get used to but it comes quick. Currently in love!	bobjrdudes	t3_5sb2sc

t3_5sb2sc	t1_dddt97c	1486348051	Other commenters have mentioned all the changes. I think saying the iPhone 7 is *much* faster than the 6s is a little too generous. Yes it is faster, but absolutely not worth the price tag if you already have a 6s. I could not recommend the iPhone 7 to any iPhone 6s user unless they have a 16gb and need the extra storage. Yes I have owned both devices. I've had my 7 since it released, so the honeymoon phase is over	0A18	t3_5sb2sc

The only reason I upgraded to 7 was because I dropped the 6S phone &amp; put a deep dent on the corner of the phone.

I would go for the 6s from your carrier or refurbished from Apple at this point. I just don't think the 7 is worth its asking price UNLESS you plan on keeping it for 3+ years or like to keep phones until they fall apart.

So, sometimes I get an email and see it on my watch. I think "I should reply to that". So I pull up my phone and instantly, I open that email and reply and I'm on my way. Same with texts, and a lots of apps I use.  Then, with Safari, I will sometimes research things on my iPad, and then continue that research on my phone or desktop.  It's just great to be able to move so seamlessly between devices.	shapeshiftingrobot	t1_ddfcg26
t3_5s1vij	t1_ddfgudk	1486439208	Makes sense. I'll start trying that. I have no emotional attachment to one or the other. Perhaps my AppleTVs just need a microphone with Siri listening in.  Edit: It's just so convenient to say, "Alexa, what time is it?"  Edit2: Just tried, "Hey, Siri, what time is it?" Got, "It's 10:49 PM. Good evening, Kyle." I don't need the fucking commentary. Just give me the time.	solinvictus21	t1_ddcvicm

t3_5si16u	t1_ddfhuih	1486440681	So the e-mail thing might be convenient, but honestly, smart watches are gimmicky pieces of technology. Can be easily supplemented with a phone.   Alternatively, if he was on Android, and had any Android watch compatible with his phone (there are a lot) and got a text, he could also respond to it from his watch. Same with e-mail and seamless Google Apps on Android. Being in the Apple ecosystem marginally changes this.   With Safari, Chrome does the exact same thing. I use that all the time and I am not constrained by OS. I have Chrome open on my Mac signed into my GMail. I see "Cookies' MacBook Pro" on Chrome, and "Cookies' Death Machine" on Chrome (my Skylake Windows desktop :D) and I can access both sets of open tabs and my place from the middle of nowhere New York regardless of whether or not I am using Windows, Mac, Android, or Linux. No one in their right mind uses Safari when you have a Google supported heavy-hitter browser.	OptionalCookie	t1_ddfgrrp
t3_5si16u	t1_ddfi7kq	1486441232	You're focusing on the wrong part of what I said. It doesn't matter where I start a task. The point is that I can continue or finish that task with a simple click or swipe. Start an email on my desktop, but need to rush off to a meeting? Tap or swipe and I'm still working on my phone. Starting research on my iPad while on the couch, but want to move back to my desk? Click. I'm done.	shapeshiftingrobot	t1_ddfhuih
t3_5sjk8a	t1_ddfkdpf	1486444864	It's a low priority. I mean, they just fixed displaying negative temperatures correctly. Use one of the many great alternatives. Weather is only decent for use with Siri.	thelance	t3_5sjk8a
t3_5sjk8a	t1_ddfkjsg	1486445169	I can actually answer this.  I'm a meteorology student. Yes I said student, please correct me if you see anything wrong with what I said. Don't be an asshole just because though.   Anyway. The iOS Weather app along with other stock apps similar to it use algorithms to predict the weather. These algorithms use Numerical Weather Prediction, which is what all the big Weather models are based. The models I analyze use NWP, it's a standard in computer weather prediction.   However, the main problem with this algorithm system is the fact it's all automatic. Believe it or not, automatic weather prediction is still not good. It usually doesn't take actual observations into effect and it often makes mistakes like the ones you mentioned.   If you want my advice, get WeatherUnderground and use the NWS data on it. The NWS is still the best at forecasting for the US and their data is based of NWP along with observed trends and statistics. It's what I use for my day to day weather info if I just need to check the weather fast. I deleted the stock app. It's useless to someone who really cares about the weather.   I feel all giddy (:   Also, fuck AccuWeather.	WeatherWrestlingGuy	t3_5sjk8a

t3_5sjk8a	t1_ddfnzpb	1486452520	Doesn't it just pull information straight from weather.com? I mean, it's still bad.

t3_5si16u	t1_ddftc5g	1486468505	Bro. This is coming from a guy who had lived with Android through and through since Nexus One. Until the Nexus 6p, then Google Pixel was announced and I am disappointed. i went for iPhone SE 16GB.  Then I use it for about a month, I missed the background refresh on Android. I mean like true background process like a mini computer. Best example, Google Photos. Android converts will understand me. I went for the Pixel because it is the latest vanilla Android offerings.   Then I am dual wielding SE and Pixel. For 1 month. I swapped my main sim to Pixel for 2 weeks. Left the SE at home. I love everything about Android. I have the figurines, plush toys, stickers, etc. But then, it never felt the same anymore ever since I used iOS.   I know iOS is not superior. But I love the consistency of the apps performance, especially the camera. I know i can capture the moment whenever I point and shoot that moment, without HDR. Plus it came out good, and even if it doesnt, there's the live photos. Damn i really cherish this feature. Those few sec moment are priceless especially with your love ones. I know Pixel is smooth and fast and everything. But the apps, are better designed on iOS. Plus everything Google Services are available on iOS, works better too. I miss the Google integration with the Android OS. Plus my office Wifi works better with Android.   Nevertherless. I think less and use iOS as I go. And I think I am comfortable with it more ever since I use it. I became more productive too. Those boring gid of icons in iOS, I am okay with that. All those limitations, i am okay with them. Battery life are great. I can always be confident with it wherever I go. iMessage is meh imo, although I giggle everytime a message from friend came in blue bubbles. My countrymen uses Whatsapp everywhere.  Whats more, the services and warranty support from Apple are available widely in my country. With the Pixel price, I kind of thinking about the risk of breaking it(although I never had any issues whatsover with imported Nexus). Plus, accesories! Everywhere there will be something somewhere for the iPhone!  Now, I have sold both my SE and Pixel. Got a 256gb iPhone 7. My Apple watch is already on the way. My next wishlist is iPad Pro and Mac Mini at least.   I use Google Services a lot. And Google has a lot of innovations in their OS. But I need the hardware of Apple. Consistencies ftw!	Luffypsp	t3_5si16u
t3_5si16u	t1_ddftxlr	1486470057	I'm not saying you can't. I'm saying Handoff and Continuity aren't gimmicks, but rather are actually very useful features.  Then he said "smart watches" are gimmicks, which was a weird thing to focus on, so I explained that the focus is that I can seamlessly move from device to device as I need to.  But no, Google products don't actually do the same thing. Opening a file or link in multiple places is there, sure, but it's not the same as Handoff and Continuity. For example, on Android, if I start an email on the browser and want to continue it on the iPhone, I have to let the browser save it as a draft (which happens automatically every minute or so), and then open it in another application. Which is fine and dandy with Google apps and an internet connection. But I have lots of other non-Apple apps that use this feature and I'm not always connected to the internet so it's a great feature for me to be able to move seamlessly between devices without having to rely on a cloud sync of some kind, or waste time saving and opening.	shapeshiftingrobot	t1_ddfr4nx
t3_5sjk8a	t1_ddfue1u	1486471146	You don't believe in using the local stations? Isn't that the whole point of weather underground?	PleaseGoOutside	t1_ddfkjsg
t3_5si16u	t1_ddfukz8	1486471576	Wow thanks! About the Google Photos, I rely on it to sync all photos and stopped bothering with Dropbox and one drive, so you need to open it every time you want it to sync?   Also, the update thing is important to me, since OnePlus pretty much ditched the One, even when it still has a lot of power, so I need to depend on nightly builds, which can be a pain sometimes (even though I like to try new ones).	Myrium	t1_ddftc5g
t3_5sjk8a	t1_ddfuqz9	1486471940	Oh my. Small things like that drive me crazy.	gloxas	t1_ddfnzpb
t3_5si16u	t1_ddfv5ee	1486472780	Yeah even when you turn on the Background app refresh, it was like hit and miss. Sometimes when I open my GPhotos app, its already backed up, sometimes its not. I got used to it though, by opening the app at least once a day. I used to snap and forget on my Nexus 6p. Now when its not working as expected, I opened the GPhotos on the browser and the new pics wasnt there. I got frustrated haha. Seems like there are specific timeframe on when the app should wake up to process it, or it slepts and never woke up until you open the app.  Another app that I notice is Google Keep, i updated a note on my other device, and when i open it on my iPhone, its not there. I had to pull to refresh it and there it was~ i guess thats the cost of getting better baterry life and reliable standby time.   However i am willing to sacrifice those for future updates. And damn, i have received 3 minor updates and all about the same time as Apple pushed it/announced it.   I can see Apple really care about after sale supports, not just while selling it, even with the competitors with advanced tech. Oh i miss the fast charging on my nexus 6p and pixel too!

t3_5sjk8a	t1_ddfwzaf	1486476089	As far as I know, Dark Sky relies on forecast.io, which uses SREF and RTMA, among others, for its data sources.   They recently launched a new website, darksky.net, if anyone is interested.	JDeppel	t1_ddflg39
t3_5sjk8a	t1_ddfx4wj	1486476338	That's because the forecast for the day called for a 10% chance of showers. And that 10% chance happened. TWC isn't going to go in and update the forecast every time a change in conditions occurs. And since that's where the iOS app gets its info from...	JDeppel	t1_ddfnzpb
t3_5sjk8a	t1_ddfxd5s	1486476706	You could try weatherline. It's based on dark sky but cleaner as I myself found the dark sky app to be bloated.	Un-trollable	t1_ddflg39

t3_5sjk8a	t1_ddfxlr3	1486477069	The local stations are very cool in theory. However, for them to be useful they have to be maintained.

t3_5si16u	t1_ddfxq45	1486477251	Oh, I liked so much about not having to worry about the sync...   I agree with the sales support since it hurts so much needing to wait the good will of the company to update your phone u.u	Myrium	t1_ddfv5ee
t3_5sjk8a	t1_ddfz7iu	1486479338	Also remember that depending on how it was forecasted, there maybe 100% chance of rain, buy in only 10% of a given area.   So the forecast is correct, it is raining, but just not everywhere. So it may be raining where you are, but on the other side of town it may not be.	crisss1205	t1_ddfnzpb

t3_5slwls	t1_ddgfin2	1486497842	Both the iPhone7 and 7+ are leaps and bounds faster than the 6s, which is faster than the 6.  I'd say, if you carry the phone in a pocket, get the "not plus", if you carry it in a purse or bag, get the plus.	kickstand	t3_5slwls

t3_5sqw4k	t1_ddh6qu6	1486533043	It isn't, but it is always possible to manipulate data to match the desired narrative.  Go to a spot closer to the servicing tower and/or a less crowded area and your LTE speeds will improve dramatically.	TheLooq	t3_5sqw4k
t3_5sqw4k	t1_ddh6v4x	1486533280	The thing is, no matter what phone I'm comparing it too, the SE is always slower. My old 5C was much more receptive than this phone. Is this a common issue w/ the SE's?   I've also compared it to android phones, which yielded results of being about three times slower. Even being on full LTE.  I'm in L.A if that helps.  I got this phone not to have to worry about it breaking since it's a much more premium device, ergo no narrative, I just want a phone that works really well.	ericerk123	t1_ddh6qu6

t3_5sqw4k	t1_ddh78mz	1486534044	I'm in San Jose, the Bay Area generally has great T-Mobile coverage, but there are plenty of places where coverage is lacking or too much congestion. I suspect that is true for every carrier, everywhere as that's just how cellular works.  I know of plenty of spots where I can pull 100mb/s speeds, and certainly places where I can get speeds like you're showing.  I carry an SE and an Android phone at all times. It is true that iPhones in general perform worse than other phones, but in real world usage it is not an issue.  If your SE does not ever perform well  then it seems likely to be a defective phone as there is nothing inherently flawed with the SE radio performance.	TheLooq	t1_ddh6v4x

t3_5sqw4k	t1_ddh9qgk	1486539917	Your iPhone 4 is running on tmobiles HSPA+ network which isn't used by most devices anymore (as they'll prefer an available LTE connection) so the odds are that your LTE connection is slow because the tower (serving panel on the tower) you're connected to is congested with a lot of connected devices. Since the iPhone 4 is connecting the HSPA+ technology on the serving panel it's not congested (because a lot of devices have LTE connectivity and don't use HSPA+(4G/3G) as a main connection anymore unless The LTE signal becomes weak in which it will hand down to 4G/3G) thus the reason it's faster. You'll find if you go into   Settings&gt;Cellular&gt;Cellular Data Options&gt;Enable LTE and turn it to Off   Your iPhone SE performance will increase because you've now forced it onto the same legacy (HSPA+) network the iPhone 4 is using. This is helpful for getting good speeds in areas with massive congestion	TannerHill	t3_5sqw4k

t3_5sqw4k	t1_ddhc9q6	1486547536	What T-Mobile data plan do you have? Since you're using Netflix's fast.com Speedtest option it's likely that your SE is subject to T-Mobiles BingeOn throttling where video streams are capped at a max of 1.5mbps since fast.com is run on the same video servers as Netflix video content. If you use the speedtest.net app from the AppStore do these numbers change? If it does it's likely that the iPhone 4 has such an old carrier profile for T-Mobile installed that it's using an old APN setup that bypasses BingeOn throttling services.	TannerHill	t1_ddhaxor

I can't wait for the OLED screen (had an S6 Edge briefly, that screen is beautiful), the increased power, better battery, new gen Touch ID, 3D Touch, Taptic Engine...the jump from the smallest 6 is going to be great.	dongmcbong	t3_5soxac

t3_5soxac	t1_ddhjzt2	1486564965	I think this will be the phone I go all out on and keep for at least 3 years till I upgrade. Even then if it is some special 10th anniversary phone then I will definitely keep it as a collectors item.  My guess is there will be a 7S with some minor upgrades then almost like a Pro version of the phone to celebrate the 10th Anniversary. However I would not be surprised if just a minor upgrade was avoided altogether and only the packed new iPhone Anniversary was released.	pwnedkiller	t3_5soxac

t3_5sqw4k	t1_ddhvaxo	1486578103	&gt; What T-Mobile data plan do you have? Since you're using Netflix's fast.com Speedtest option it's likely that your SE is subject to T-Mobiles BingeOn throttling where video streams are capped at a max of 1.5mbps since fast.com is run on the same video servers as Netflix video content. If you use the speedtest.net app from the AppStore do these numbers change? If it does it's likely that the iPhone 4 has su  I've disabled binge on, I'm on the fully unlimited plan "simple choice"	ericerk123	t1_ddhc9q6
t3_5suf76	t1_ddhveg8	1486578208	That sounds about right to upload 50GB. Uploading 50GB in 10 hours would be 1.38 MB a second, which seems pretty believable for a home internet connection upload speed.	_-__-__-__-__-_	t3_5suf76

t3_5suf76	t1_ddhwnte	1486579567	Yes, iCloud Photo Library is different. One stores just the camera roll in the cloud. With the iCloud Photo Library, it stores all your photos in the cloud, meaning you don't really have a camera roll anymore. Your photos are just in your library automatically. It uploads your photos and videos to the cloud automatically when connected to WiFi.  I find iCloud Photo Library to be really convenient as it means my computer and phone are always in sync photo/video wise.  When you switch to iCloud Photo Library, the camera roll no longer needs backing up and ceases to be part of the backup. It will definitely take a long time to get this all set up, but once you do, it should be a pretty nice set up.	maniacalyeti	t3_5suf76
t3_5sqw4k	t1_ddhx8t9	1486580199	It's not great, but the phone is much easier to handle at that size.	ericerk123	t1_ddhwnlj

t3_5suf76	t1_ddhyd5z	1486581425	Makes sense! Thank you. But, a few questions:  - Would it matter if I turn on both iCloud Photo Library and camera roll backup to iCloud? Or should I turn off the iCloud camera roll backup and just turn on the iCloud Photo Library vice versa?   - When iCloud Photo Library is turned on, it's automatically in the cloud, right? So would I still be able to view my photos and watch my videos from the photos app if I have no internet connection or is internet connection necessary?   Sorry, I've been meaning to set up iCloud for quite a long time but have been reluctant to do so since it's my first time and I don't know too much about how it works.	WarHundreds	t1_ddhwnte
t3_5suf76	t1_ddhz1pv	1486582170	Unfortunately I've never been able to get this to work for me. Signed in both my iPad and my iPhone to the same iCloud account, turned on all the syncing settings, nothing. Neither contacts (except for a few random ones) nor photos show up from one device to the other, and they're both on wifi for several hours every evening/night. I've spent probably a couple hours troubleshooting it with web resources but nothing worked.   Really left a bad taste in my mouth about Apples cloud services, they seem quite sub par in comparison to the competitors. I'm guessing I'll just have to go into an Apple store at some point.	kronos0	t1_ddhwnte
t3_5suf76	t1_ddhz4o9	1486582262	I don't think the camera roll will even be available once the iCloud Photo Library is done with its initial upload of photos and videos.  As for what is available with no internet connection, in the Photos settings you have a choice on that one: Optimize iPhone Storage will save the originals in the cloud and keep a smaller version on the phone. I think often you can't access videos on the phone with no connection but it depends on the age of the video in question or when it was last played I think.	maniacalyeti	t1_ddhyd5z
t3_5suf76	t1_ddi0y2p	1486584253	That even seems *fast* for a home internet connection. If you're on cable, you're lucky to get more than 5 Mbps (0.625 MB/s) which would take around 22 hours to upload 50 GB.	kstrike155	t1_ddhveg8

Those are the numbers you'll get when doing a speed test but actually downloading and uploading is a different story.  I have 60 down/up and I'll be lucky to hit an actual 6-7mb/s on downloading things.	sugarkryptonite	t1_ddi1ps5

t3_5suf76	t1_ddi38ja	1486586770	For contacts go to the Contacts app and click on groups in the top left corner (if it is there) and see if your contacts are syncing through another account like email. Do this by only showing your iCloud contacts. Then only showing contacts syncing with other accounts.   If that's the case you'll have to add that account on all your devices for them to sync.

t3_5suf76	t1_ddi8d9c	1486592544	The camera roll is no longer included in standard backups with IPL turned on. And it depends if you have "download and keep originals" function turned on.  "Optimize Phone Storage" reduces your lesser viewed images to needed thumbnails that you generally scroll past, and streams them in if you interact with them. There is no manual control of any kind except perhaps favoriting, which I think only gives added weight to the cache math.	InsaneNinja	t1_ddhyd5z

t3_5suf76	t1_ddi9h2a	1486593864	Understood. Thank you. Btw if you choose to optimize phone storage, at what quality does iCloud optimize the photos and videos? Is there a significant change due to the compressed sizes? I believe with google photos, if a photo is more than 16mp resolution, it would be deduced to a photo with 16mp quality and videos kept at 1080p max if they are above that resolution; does icloud do the same thing?

t3_5t1vkl	t1_ddk6mt3	1486697460	This reminds me of the time I had a mate staying at my place for a few days and he accidentally had his hard drive shared on the LAN. So I said "fuck it" and just went ahead and copied his entire porn folder without telling him.   Some time later I realised that folder also included his personal homemade porn with his girlfriend. Obviously I forgot to mention to him that I had a copy of that stuff.   Then years later he was crying about how he'd lost all his personal porn because of a hard drive failure, and lost forever all the hot videos of his ex. At which point I told him that nope, they're definitely not lost forever.  I believe his response was something along the lines of "omg awesome! send them to me, you evil thieving cunt".	sobri909	t1_ddjvr6r

t3_5t1vkl	t1_ddk6xj5	1486697876	&gt; I'd rather ask why aren't users being prompted for this.  You can to opt in/out of this. It's listed as "Safari" in the iCloud settings.  The reason why they do it is so that Safari on each of your devices can auto complete URLs and searches from your history.   It's all stored securely in a way that's not accessible to anyone who doesn't have your iCloud login (eg even Apple themselves can't see it).   iCloud tends to be one of the most secure cloud services. So even if they accidentally store something they shouldn't, it's typically only ever going to be accessible by you and no one else anyway.	sobri909	t1_ddjr454
t3_5t36wg	t1_ddk6z0f	1486697936	No problem! I'm just amazed at how well the battery lasts even with medium/heavy use.

t3_5t36wg	t1_ddk8iyv	1486700275	Jail breaking makes your iPhone into an android though. Constantly crashes, some apps can't even use without a jailbreak detection tweak, looking for work around. If you only use a couple of tweaks, I guess it's worth it but theming gets old and you basically got android when you jailbreak. I like a phone that works, that runs and isn't a mess. Quality over quantity.	Bigchile123	t1_ddjzzsr

t3_5t36wg	t1_ddk8xr3	1486700906	I wasn't really stressing the point that it's more secure. Your less likely to encounter issues as with iOS you would really have to screw up as the only time I've ever had any issues with iOS is when you tapped on a crappy site and it opens tabs or prevents you from returning to the page before it. They both have their ups and downs but overall I have barely any issues with iOS than I ever did with android.	ViolentLambs	t1_ddk8mtp

t3_5t36wg	t1_ddkebod	1486711579	&gt;I always loved android for it ability to let the user customize the device to their will and usefulness depend on how far that user wanted to go, from stock to throwing so many custom roms at it until I found just the right one.  *Cough in jailbreak* You can do way more thing on a jailbroken iDevice than on Android, even rooted. Because, ok you can you can change the appearance, but you forget the system changes that are deeper on an iOS JB. I will not give an example, there are **too many** things possible, and obviously it depends on the use of the person. (And this is a deadly debate, like console vs pc)  "Oh you jailbreak your iPhone to make it look like Android". To all these persons, leave earth before I murder you !  Just kidding, I'll not kill anyone, but these person still dumbasses.  So...**Invalid argument**   And stop comparing iOS and Android. According to you,why everybody says "iPhone and Android" and not "iPhone and Samsung, LG, Sony etc" when they talk about cellular !? It is a category apart, the only point in common being that they are all mobile phones. It's like comparing 15 brands of bikes to a truck, there's something wrong with the comparison. They are all vehicule that can be driven by a human, but... WTH ?   But, don't get it wrong, I agree with what you said about the 7+, and even if my main device is jailbroken I like iPhone like they are, and I do not denigrate Android Users, I prefer salty crackers and you prefer sweet crackers, it's ok.  NB: I do not want to be hostile, I just struggle to express myself and nuance my talk because english is not my native language and I'm tired. So sorry if I did not use the appropriate word in a sentence.	konishiwoi	t3_5t36wg

t3_5t36wg	t1_ddkmlsz	1486734227	I understand what your coming from but have you actually used several android phones over the years? I have enough that I could go with a different phone every da for two months. I'm not trying to be an asshole and I am sorry if I come off as that but there are many important differences. Look under the hood at how android and iOS both work. Not by apps I mean code wise. They are entirely different operating systems. A phone is a phone but how it works is what makes it nice. Sure I could jailbreak my phone but here's the problem. It's a pain in the ass to do. I tried the jailbreak and sure it was badass but unstable as hell and I had to update to 10.2. Even those with legacy devices can't jailbreak unless they are luck enough to be on specific versions and even then support will end for them.   I wrote this as if a normal user is going to get it not people like us who can add more potential. Anyone can jailbreak and has the right to but that would just add confusing lingo and such. If someone wanted to jailbreak and make he phone look and work they wanted to they already have a subreddit for that.	ViolentLambs	t1_ddkebod
t3_5t36wg	t1_ddkn2k2	1486735002	It's an insanely good display. You literally can't even make out any pixels when looking closely at it. Even legacy apps like jelly car that have to be stretched to fit look great. Pictures and videos look gorgeous as well. Personally I prefer amoled displays as colors can be deeper and more power efficient where I think it's a little silly that the iPhone 7 has to have the entire backlight on even at a black screen witch is off to me. Colors look intense and vibrant so there's no complaints but I'd take amoled over LCD.   Edit: I'm at work and when I get home I can answer this much more better and in depth.	ViolentLambs	t1_ddkfw48

The most popular social app (WeChat) uses them for adding people, reading articles, and much more. You can even pay at stores and send money to friends with QR codes in China. Every website you visit has a QR code in the footer or at the end of an article. My Chinese phone's camera app natively recognizes QR codes when taking a picture since they are so heavily used.	toaster99	t1_ddkt90w

I always had a more pleasurable experience with stock android than I did with Samsungs touch whiz, HTC sense(loved it back at sense 4 animated weather was kickass). The jailbreak scene is so limited to certain iOS versions that the likely good of actually getting a phone with a jailbreakable  version is less in your favor. When I got my iPhone 7 I just so happen to have gotten one with 10.1.1 but I made a mistake and had to update.

t3_5t36wg	t1_ddl7js6	1486760042	Heres the thing, the 1440p amoled displays aren't really 1440p.   They only have a resolution of 1440p on the green channel, the red and blue channels are both 720p. This is due to the pixel layout used, in the case of the S7 for example it is Diamond Pentile.  What this means is that content that is mainly red and/or blue, but lacks green is actually not that sharp. You can see this very clearly by using the Gear VR. Text on white backgrounds does look very sharp though.  Here is an example I took of my [S7 Edges' screen](http://imgur.com/t5smniF). Notice the much more visible pixels on the blue and red sections of Google's logo.  The 1080p panel in the 7 plus actually has more total sub-pixels than the 1440p panels on pretty much any OLED.  **Total Sub-pixels**  S7 Edge: 5,529,600 iPhone 7 Plus: 6,220,800	x3n0n1c	t1_ddkfw48

t3_5t66am	t1_ddlf7ro	1486770168	They were EVERYWHERE in Japan when I visited back in 2008. Think about it — everyone's got a web-enabled flip phone. But typing in a URL on those is a pain in the ass, especially since URLs are not written in Japanese. Luckily, every phone has a camera and built-in QR code scanning software. You could click on any poster you found along your walk and get info.  Their phones were years ahead of anything back in North America before the iPhone came around. The shitty rental phone I had even had a built-in TV tuner.  Japan also has a lot more foot traffic than most of North America. Everything's so densely packed, so more people are walking and getting the train than driving. Also, Japan has a lot of little interactive public events (like stamp rallies — where you explore an area to find a number of booths with a stamp. If you collect all the stamps, you can get a price.). Those make great use of QR codes.  The problem here is that no smartphone I've seen has ever had QR scanning *built-in* as native software. It's always been a third-party app. As such, there's always an additional step in the way. **If Apple had built QR scanning into the camera app from the beginning, QR codes could have caught on a *lot* more.**	ZippoS	t1_ddkt90w

t3_5t66am	t1_ddlkasf	1486777901	Force touching really doesn't exist on Android, though Samsung is rumored to bring it with the Galaxy S8. What you're experiencing is a long touch feature added to the stock launcher, as well as Nova Prime.  I mean, force touching requires a pressure sensitive screen, and AFAIK no Android phone has done it yet. But Google (and Nova) are working on a workaround for those which don't. Originally it was going to be swipe down on the icon.	dragontology	t1_ddktp0y

This stuff is very old and well trodden paths, and your computer and smartphone and doing them constantly, for all sorts of things. Most online communications are encrypted these days, with unencrypted being the exception.   Also Apple have repeatedly taken a pro privacy, pro encryption, pro security stance, even going to court with the US government over it. So yeah, there's no reason to doubt their adherence to the absolute basics.	sobri909	t1_ddlq92f

t3_5tcu2v	t1_ddlwd40	1486803432	A couple things.  One, it's not paint; it doesn't peel. Here's a quote from an anodizing expert:  &gt;More importantly, Apple has deployed some advanced anodizing technologies. Anodizing is an electrochemical process that "grows" a uniform layer of aluminum oxide across the surface of the part, and there are a number of different methods for making this happen... oxygen molecules in the sulfuric acid to bond to the outer layer of the aluminum, creating a skin of aluminum oxide - a ceramic material that is far harder than the underlying aluminum.  &gt;The best theory that we've developed is that Apple is using a combination of tricks to achieve anodizing superior to the typical processes everyone else employs, combined with post-anodizing processing. Most likely, Apple uses the high currents and chilled baths of Type III anodizing to produce a dense, thin layer. Before sealing, this layer gets stuffed with dyes, optical brighteners, and hardening elements to further enhance the surface properties (hence Space Gray's almost silver appearance, the bronze undertones of the Space Gray Sport, and the clear silver on the standard Sport).  It's an incredibly hard layer of a completely different substance coating the outside of the device. It doesn't peel.  It can, however, chip or flake. That's what's going on here.  As for mine, I have had zero issues with it and plenty of opportunities. I'm not sure if my anecdata is much help though.	quintsreddit	t3_5tcu2v
t3_5tcu2v	t1_ddlx3vf	1486805957	That's kinda true, i had this kinda problem with my previous space gray 6s, it was in case 24/7 but i only took the case of once in a while to clean it and my phone, it looked like the dusts that trapped inbetween case and phone caused the chipping. I just got my matte black 7 a few days ago and haven't put it in a case. Do you own 1 too? Do you use case? Also what sort of opportunities do you mean? Thanks.	Davcoss	t1_ddlwd40

t3_5tcu2v	t1_ddlxdvc	1486806963	I paid $99 two months ago to replace my 7 Plus because I thought my dog scratched the top of the phone. But I was so sure that I didn't leave my phone anywhere where my dog or anything could get it. And then I noticed the paint chipped off the bottom speaker grill this evening. Mind you I keep my phone in a leather pouch at all times, I'm going to the Apple store in the morning to see if they can replace it because I paid outright for a premium product and it shouldn't chip after 2 months.

t3_5t1vkl	t1_ddlxnrc	1486807960	They've also talked about adapting machine learning for Siri being local data from the user.

t3_5t66am	t1_ddly67f	1486809820	Well yes, the Nintendo DS is a great example of pressure sensitive touch display as it operates both the original iPhone and the first Android device. So don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Apple innovated the feature.  I tested the force touch feature on my wife's Droid Turbo 2, and while the context menu came up as expected, it didn't include a new tab option, but her Chrome may be out of date. She doesn't ever check for updates; IIRC the Google Play store would check for then and download automatically, on Wi-Fi, eventually.	dragontology	t1_ddlt32o

At the time, however, having a TV tuner was commonplace. The phone also lacked emoji (which were already a big thing there), native support for Japan's [EEW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_Early_Warning_\(Japan\)), and, yes, native support for QR scanning. A lot of little things made the first iPhones less appealing for the Japanese public.  Emoji and native support for EEW were later added, QR scanning can be handled through third-party apps, and streaming apps take care of video. The iPhone caught up, so it became popular.  &gt; Then the claim that QR codes were EVERYWHERE is likewise outdated.

t3_5tkbz9	t1_ddn5ruw	1486886042	Thing is, the phone doesn't show a notification count or anything, when I open the app I see a red dot on the voicemail tab, when I click it it calls my voice mail and says 0 Messages, red dot goes away, I reopen the dialer it comes back	RamiDebab	t3_5tkbz9
t3_5tkbz9	t1_ddn6gm4	1486888068	I'm on Verizon and it was doing the same thing.  Hitting the voicemail tab would dial it directly and then clear the dot, but it would return.

Assuming Green is full resolution, that means that there is Half the number of Red and Blue pixels as Green in each direction.  2560/2=1280 Width 1440/2=720 Height  ie. 720p  1280x720=921600 2560x1440=3686400  So, 921600 Red, 921600 Blue, 3686400 Green, for a grand total of 5529600.	x3n0n1c	t1_ddpbkow

t3_5t36wg	t1_ddqu3au	1487102982	Still pretty sure that is not how it works. By your math, there would be 1.5 sub-pixels per pixel, which doesn't sound possible. 2 sub-pixels per pixel RG-BG-RG-BG is how it works, which still gives you twice as many green per blue and red, and equates to 7,372,800 sub-pixels which is more than a 1080p RGB stripe display. Additionally, putting my damn phones directly in my face (7 Plus and Pixel XL), the Pixel XL is clearly sharper.  http://www.oled-info.com/files/images/amoled-vs-super-amoled-plus-img_assist-300x224.jpg	Nitemare3219	t1_ddq9496
t3_5t36wg	t1_ddquxhh	1487103910	Count the pixels yourself, it isn't hard.   And it looks sharper because it is. There is a full 1440p resolution there on the green channel, and our eyes are most sensitive to that colour. Additonally, at least in the Galaxy phone, they are able to do subpixel rendering, which allows them to treat each sub-pixel as its own element, rather than as a group (red, green, blue) like in standard RGB.  But, all that said, it simple falls apart when you get really close. GearVR for example. Or if displaying images mostly comprised of blue and red. As long as there is a decent amount of green it will still appear to be quite sharp.  Diamond Pentil used the following arrangement. A - is a blank space. You can't refute this, it is right there in my picture.  R-B-R-B-R-  -G-G-G-G-G  B-R-B-R-B-  -G-G-G-G-G  It is lines of alternating red and blue, followed by lines of just green. Every other line of B/R swap the order of the colors.	x3n0n1c	t1_ddqu3au
t3_5t36wg	t1_ddqv50b	1487104136	Really. You go ahead and count all X million sub-pixels then.  My math says you're wrong, every review that mentions PenTile says you're wrong (i.e. 2 sub-pixels per pixel, not 1.5) and so does Samsung's marketing material (you know, the people who make the panels).   I'm not saying PenTile is good. I hate it actually, because of the sharpness reduction and inability to properly render straight lines. Thankfully 1440p on a phone display is high enough resolution that it doesn't really matter, but looking at a 1440p RGB stripe LCD, it is still noticeably sharper than a 1440p PenTile.	Nitemare3219	t1_ddquxhh
t3_5t36wg	t1_ddqvu9w	1487104895	You take a small sample of pixels, and multiply the numbers out. Are you that thick?  I already did the damn math for you. The evidence is right there. They don't swap the layout mid screen, its consistent all the way across.  So again, count them. There are 50 coloured dots in that image, how many of them are green, how many are red, how many are blue?  By the way, the reason reviews mention 2/3rds is because of how this layout allows them to borrow a sub pixels from its nearest neighbor to essentially fake having more. Allowing lines to appear sharper than they would if they didn't do this. Go check out an old sub HD pentile screen and youll see how this falls apart when the sub pixels aren't super tiny like on these HD and QHD screens.	x3n0n1c	t1_ddqv50b

t3_5u537x	t3_5u537x	1487129323	Never used an iOS device before, I have a few questions.	S9c9clark	-1
t3_5u537x	t1_ddrfgrs	1487130109	1. The SE is definitely worth buying - plenty fast and capable, and the only real caveat is the smaller screen size.  It should see a few years of software update support, and some are not thinking that Apple will replace it every year, but keep it as a low-end device and let it age out.  2. The SE is looks like a 5/5S, but has the internals of the 6S (so slightly slower than a 7).  The rear camera is the same as the 6S, but the front camera and display are like that of the 5S.  It also has the older Touch ID found on the 5S and 6.  Capability-wise, it can do just about everything the 6S does except 3D Touch (it does do Live Photos and Apple Pay).  This will help play the spec-comparison game: http://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/  3. iOS is quite secure since all apps come from the App Store (unless you jailbreak...don't unless you're really comfortable and understand the risks), and Apple manages all OS updates, not carriers.  This means every iPhone can access every software update at the same time.  4. They're all siloed by their app (Phone, Messages, Mail, or a third party communication app) - BlackBerry was very ambitious with that method centered around people.  5. Battery life is about a day per charge on most devices - the SE is actually the best in the lineup (behind maybe the 7 Plus, 6S Plus) in real-world usage.  I can't speak to the bigger phones, but my SE lasts the day with plenty to spare when I go to bed.  I used to have a 6 and it was pretty good, too.  Personally, I like iOS from the standpoint that it can be quick and efficient and simple.  Some tech folks don't like the limitations of iOS (much like BB's limitations years ago) because it cuts down on tinkering and the ability to do everything and anything they could dream up.  Android certainly has its place (the Nexus and Pixels are what I'd look at if I went the Android route), but for me, I prefer iOS for its appliance-like nature.	ecs0013	t3_5u537x
t3_5u537x	t1_ddrfjng	1487130226	* Yes, it has the internals of the 6s, it only lacks the 3D Touch feature. I'd say it's worth buying, but others may have another opinion.  * See above.  * Not sure, but I think iPhones are encrypted and I feel it's secure enough for my everyday uses.  * No familiarity with Hub, but notifications and their management leave something to be desired when compared to newer Android.  * The SE, with a small screen, has some phenomenal battery life. The Plus models have great battery life as well.	CaptNemo131	t3_5u537x
t3_5u537x	t1_ddrims5	1487135207	Out of curiosity, why do you find Android too inefficient? How do BBs do it better?  I definitely miss features from older phones, especially profiles that were so prevalent in Nokias, but I'd be surprised if they'd surpass modern Androids/iPhones in total efficiency.	SponTen	t3_5u537x
t3_5u537x	t1_ddrixul	1487135750	Regarding your third question, I'd refer you to [this document](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf) Apple released in regards to iOS security. It goes quite in depth and gives me assurance that the company is dedicated to provide security for its users.	e0rt	t3_5u537x

t3_5u537x	t1_ddrjskr	1487137330	Most flagship Android phones are now encrypted. You fail to mention sandboxing or the timely security updates.	ScaryRaebbit	t1_ddrfjng
t3_5u537x	t1_ddrjzz3	1487137716	There are quite a few things that I find better on BBs. Some things the Bold series does better even than BB10.  * Suppose, on a Bold, that I am on the home screen and want to text Roger. I type CR and press enter, and now I am typing a message to Roger. It took 0.2 seconds to do that, and I could do it without looking at the screen. On Android, I have to open the messenger app, click compose, click Roger's name. That took at least 2 seconds, or 10 times longer. And I definitely had to look at what I was doing.  * If I come back to my phone after leaving it unattended, the red blinker tells me that I have a message. Many Android devices have this as well, but the notifications can be cleared by anybody without unlocking the device. In such a case I would never know I got a notification.  * More control over password locking. On any BlackBerry device I can turn off the screen without password locking it, and it will stay unlocked until it times out. I can also lock it on demand by pressing K. Making an Android device lock **only** on demand or after X minutes, but not when turning off the screen, is not straightforward. Not a huge deal with a fingerprint sensor though.  * Notifications don't get accidentally cleared on BB. On Android I might swipe away a notification. What if I didn't mean to, and I forget what app it was? Now I have no idea if it was an updated app, a Whatsapp message, or a missed call. On a BB Bold notifications stay until you click on them. On BB10 they are tracked forever in the Hub.  * Lockscreen control is excellent on BB10. I can look at my locked device and know who an email is from. The content is hidden, but the sender is visible - this seems to be impossible on Android, where it's an all or nothing option.  These points are important to me because I frequently leave my phone unattended with other people, and I am extremely sensitive to security and privacy. The way I use my phone is very, very different from most people. I also have no idea how iPhones compare to these points.	S9c9clark	t1_ddrims5
t3_5u5mp4	t1_ddrk2m1	1487137855	No.   You can use Bluetooth headphones.   Or  The Apple phone dock.   Or  A wireless speaker. (Airplay, Bluetooth, SONOS)	Jabingla	t3_5u5mp4
t3_5u537x	t1_ddrk3aa	1487137891	I will definitely read through that. A company saying they "will not" access your data is different from "we cannot."	S9c9clark	t1_ddrixul
t3_5u537x	t1_ddrlup1	1487141714	That's a very extensive list, and you have very specific and well-thought-out requirements. I like that; thank you for writing it. Very few people need anything more than "the basics" these days though. I miss when tech catered to techies :(  I think you'll find most, if not all (and more) of those issues will occur on iOS too. Not defending Android here, just saying that both OSs seem to be trying to cater to the everyman these days, and a lot of that is too complicated for people to even think about. So moving to iOS *may* not be the answer for you, unless you're willing to forego those benefits for some other requirements.  On an Android, I think you *could* solve most of those issues for you by flashing a custom rom and modding the shit out of it, but it would be a lengthy process with potential downsides. I know with custom launchers though you could somewhat sold your 4th point; notification badges can be set to remain on apps until you actually open that app, even after clearing the notification in the lockscreen. Notification history would be pretty useful to have though.  I have a Xiaomi Mi5, and you can set notifications to not display on the lockscreen at all. Since you can unlock the phone with a fingerprint in under 0.5 seconds, you could then swipe down for your notifications. No one else could do this unless they had their fingerprint registered. And as mentioned above, I'm certain this level of customisation is possible if you flash and/or mod. For iPhones though, you may have to look into jailbreaking, if that's even possible any more (I don't have a lot of experience with iPhones sorry).	SponTen	t1_ddrjzz3

t3_5u537x	t1_ddrns7f	1487146828	I run Cyanogenmod and Xposed on my Galaxy S4, and it solves many of my problems, including the lock-on-demand requirement. Some problems persist, and some new ones crop up.  Running a custom rom requires unlocking the bootloader. As I understand it, an unlocked bootloader will allow someone to dump the memory of the device, giving unrestricted access to my (encrypted) data. I would need to use a very long password to protect against a brute force attack, and enter this password dozens of times per day. Android's Remote Wipe feature would be useless because the data could already be copied.  I can probably solve some of my concerns with a stock, non-rooted rom, but even then there is the concern of how Google and Apple treat user privacy. I use a minimal amount of Google services because I am uncomfortable with the data they track and how they store it. I expose as little data as possible to my Galaxy S4. It still has a lot of my data because it's the only device I have that can run apps.  Reading about Apple's approach to security, and assuming they are 100% truthful, non-jailbroken iPhones seem to be inherently more secure. Apple does not track user data, and cannot possibly decrypt any data or iMessage on my device. The iPhone's memory cannot be extracted or brute-forced.  This is more than can be said for BlackBerry, which gave the BBM encryption key to the Canadian RCMP (and who knows what other police agencies.) Not that I have anything to hide, but I am *extremely* protective of my privacy, to the point that I do not bring my phone when I cross the Canadian border. (I saw the Canadian border guards arrest someone for not telling their phone password.)	S9c9clark	t1_ddrlup1

t3_5u537x	t1_ddrol6z	1487149320	Sounds like you're very unique then. In this day and age, the world will not be kind to you for consumer products; pretty much everything big is targeted at the common denominator in order to maximise potential profit. But I'm sure you already know that. I really do wish more people thought this deeply about their products and morals.  iOS is, from what I understand, more secure than Android mainly due to the fact that it's not open sourced. That being said...  &gt; Apple... cannot possibly decrypt any data or iMessage on my device. The iPhone's memory cannot be extracted or brute-forced.  Did you see everything that happened with the San Bernardino FBI/iPhone case? iOS is super secure from the looks of it, but it's still possible. I don't think it's possible to 100% prevent decryption/hacking/extraction/etc on any device, at least not with current technology. But yeah Apple definitely have a better stance on privacy than BB, from the sounds of it.  I guess iPhones are the only way to go for what you truly want. Maybe Windows Phones would be "more secure" just by the fact that so few people use them, that there will be fewer people trying to break into them. But with either of these, you will not have the customisation of Android/BB. And with Android, you likely will not have the security of the others.  Good luck, regardless!	SponTen	t1_ddrns7f

t3_5u537x	t1_ddrpwm2	1487153604	Coming from Android Nougat to iOS 10, your quibbles with notifications will definitely not go away. iOS's notification setup is worse. For instance, you can't even hide sensitive information on notifications unless it is Mail or Messages. It's either you want lock screen notifications with the information shown or nothing.

t3_5u537x	t1_ddrpy8o	1487153757	If you flashed GApps then Google is still vacuuming a lot of your data. If you are truly concerned about your privacy, I'd look into something like CopperHead OS.	ScaryRaebbit	t1_ddrns7f

t3_5u5mp4	t1_ddrx310	1487169371	To be honest, no. I wanted to buy an adapter, but there are no MFi for sale right know. The belkin adapter is the only one with a certificate.  Many amazon reviews from the cheap ones says, that the audio quality is bad, the remote control doesnt work and sometimes, the iPhone refuse to charge.  It is not explicit this adapter, its explicit gadgets with no MFi certificate. I had this discussion a few times age on Reddit, someone said, that the certificate is an eyewash - but my old non-MFi gadgets (mostly cables) are so pretty bad!  Its only a recommendation!

t3_5u537x	t1_ddsipz1	1487193828	Not in and of itself, no.

Newer iPhones really don't last all that long unfortunately. 2 years tops it seems.

Battery life on the one with battery issues was still easily 7 hours with me using it. Now it lasts nearly 12 hours.  The phone is still fast and doesn't have any software issues.

t3_5ub3ke	t1_ddtlw2f	1487259985	There still tons of iphone 5, 5s, and 6s out there.  Some people get unlucky but it doesn't mean they all will die.  I manage the phones here at my company and in the 2 years since its release I've had exactly 1 iPhone 6 come back due to non-damage related failure, and that was due to a faulty battery which apple replaced free.

t3_5ufcne	t1_ddtn43f	1487261389	No, it is water resistant. It might survive a dunk, and it should definitely be OK if splashed or rained on, but submerging for long periods of time and constant exposure to water (like at the beach or on a boat or pool) is not safe.	Wdc331	t1_ddtju1k
t3_5ufjpu	t1_ddtnain	1487261593	I've had mine since about 2 weeks after launch and I'm very happy with it. The camera is very tempting on the 7+ but I'll probably wait for the 8+ / 8s+ as it's still a very capable phone.	TheArmandoV	t3_5ufjpu

But other than that it's been the best phone I've ever had and my first iPhone.  I don't see the 7 as a necessary upgrade because its only marginally faster and waterproofing isn't a big deal to me because I don't plan on putting my phone anywhere near it, but I think I'll wait for the so called 8 and see if its a worthy upgrade.

The camera is the whole reason why I got the iPhone 6s Plus. It isn't good enough to upgrade. The zoom lens is just a zoom lens. There isn't even an OIS in the zoom lens either.  Memory isn't much of a benefit since Apple decided to update the memory options for the 6s to match the 7 Plus.  Wait for the S line or the 8 if you want to upgrade	HansChr15	t3_5ufjpu

t3_5ub3ke	t1_ddu5pcb	1487281537	It just seems like there's more 3G/3GS/4/4S out there running strong than 5S or 6. It's like instead of making phones that people will be able to carry for 7 years, Apple is designing the internals to not last as long and start dying out around that 2 year contract point, so people are forced to upgrade. Planned obsolescence and all that. I've seen more 3G and 4 out and about than 5. But maybe that's just because I live in a town of old people.	Zengru	t1_ddtlw2f

The 5 line (or maybe SE) I see all the time. Tons still have em.  I don't see 4 or 4s that often, and can't remember the last time I saw someone using anything lower than that.	x3n0n1c	t1_ddu5pcb

The protection on the iPhone is actually a lot better than most cases (The only exception being the ones that are almost a plastic bag, covering everything, including the screen and speakers). And the rating on the iPhone actually should protect against immersion, not only splashes. I wouldn't trust *any* waterproof phone or case when diving or on a pool, but you are absolutely right, there's no point in using a case that doesn't even work that well with a phone that's by itself water resistant.	kadupse	t1_ddtpym3

t3_5uofrg	t1_ddvocp1	1487367303	I broke an old iPhone a few years ago and before we went to a family plan with both newer iPhones, my girlfriend let me borrow an older Android phone until we figured out our situation. Not even trying to be a fanboy her, but I hated every second of using the device...   The only thing I thought was a neat trick was that it had a small built-in LED which for let you know you had notifications without even needing to pick up the phone. I believe it blinked different colors for different things. I'd say that the new way my 7 will show me the notification center just by picking it up is close, but with the Android I didn't even have to touch the phone; as long as it was face up I could glance at it to know its status.	tristinDLC	t3_5uofrg

t3_5uofrg	t1_ddvr4ap	1487370851	I tried to upgrade from my iPhone 4 to the LG G2 about 3 years ago, but I returned it and got the 5S within a week of owning that G2. Android felt so... tacked together. It was like everything was trying to fall apart and crash all of the time. I'm not saying nothing's ever crashed on iOS (far from it), but the instability i experienced, coupled with the laaaaame battery life and a few other things were just too much for me. Happily upgraded to the 5S which I used daily for 3 years, now happily with a 7+ and loving it more than ever.   I have nothing against people who use and love Android devices, but I'm sticking with iPhones.	nb4hnp	t1_ddvocp1

t3_5ukpzv	t1_ddvv6zm	1487376485	My favorite cases are the leather clad ones from apple. Used them with my 6, 6s, 6s+ and now 7+.

I was looking for a "carbon-fiber" case but none of the ones I wanted look like they'd protect much at all until I saw this one. Very good design with the 2 piece aspect. Easy to get on and off. Would highly recommend.   EDIT: The back feels like a leathery material so it's not real obviously but has some texture to it. also doesn't make the phone much bigger(I have fairly large hands so I prefer this over a smaller less grippy case.)	trill-chino	t3_5ukpzv

t3_5uuinx	t1_ddxpgcd	1487506065	Yeah, if sound quality is important, you can get much better bang for the buck at the price range of the PowerBeats. Also, Bluetooth is always the biggest impediment in the face of sound quality, at least for 2017 technology.   Even though there are pricier wireless models, you're arguably paying more for the convenience of going wireless than the sound quality and fidelity. However, if convenience is more important, then arguably it is money well spent. It comes down to use case in the end.	Makegooduseof	t1_ddxo8w2

t3_5uuinx	t1_ddxywmz	1487524526	They lack bass and you have to turn them up quite a bit to get "better" sound. They're $30 though, so you're really getting what you pay for. I still recommend them because they've given me zero problems for the 2 months of daily use I've put them through. I'm using them for the gym and my daily commute. I'm not using them for supreme studio quality sound, if that makes sense.	Mack21	t1_ddx68xm
t3_5uuinx	t1_ddy7nbk	1487536568	At the USD250 level, you have a TON of options. However, I usually have a much lower ceiling for earphones so I can't provide anything close to that range.

t3_5v0exx	t1_ddy97tg	1487538702	But they won't stay in the cloud if I delete them from my phone will they?	justincolts	t1_ddy958s
t3_5v0exx	t1_ddy9nfz	1487539302	They ~~will~~ won't, you can choose to keep either the originals or "optimized" ones on your phone.	iBurnedTheChurch	t1_ddy97tg
t3_5v0exx	t1_ddya5lm	1487539992	if you have iCloud photo library enabled and you delete a photo from any of your devices, that photo is removed from all devices and iCloud. you can't pick and choose which photos you have stored on a single device. it's all our none.	teedoff087	t1_ddy9nfz
t3_5v0exx	t1_ddyabto	1487540232	Huh, I stand corrected then. Don't really use the feature all that much because I don't usually take photos but just have them sync up and I though they stayed in the cloud even after removing from the phone. Must've confused them then.	iBurnedTheChurch	t1_ddya5lm
t3_5v0exx	t1_ddydnup	1487544843	if you want to delete certain photos from your iPhone but keep them in the cloud, you need a third party solution. Google Photos is a popular one.	teedoff087	t1_ddyb3uo

t3_5v14n1	t1_ddyfccl	1487547233	The phone is still under warranty. Take it to Apple for repair or replacement (assuming there's no water damage).	greatcaffeine	t3_5v14n1
t3_5v0exx	t1_ddyfkim	1487547560	Correct.  The original file size is limited and then requires you to pay.  But they do offer a slightly compressed version which for pictures taken from your phone is fine.  Unless you're actually printing them out there's no advantage to uploading original sizes.	millsmillsmills	t1_ddyf6b7
t3_5v14n1	t1_ddyfups	1487547960	You think? Even if the phone works? It completely works. Just the home button spazzing out	ScottMalgieri	t1_ddyf09p
t3_5v14n1	t1_ddygvg5	1487549432	that discoloration at the bottom left is a water spot. even though the iPhone 7 is rated as water resistant, Apple does not guarantee that water can never make its way into the device.	teedoff087	t1_ddyfups

t3_5v14n1	t1_ddyh9ou	1487549989	It might not be liquid damage. but why would the rest of the phone working mean that the home button, or some part of it, isn't damaged on its own? Genuinely curious, I'm not electrically inclined	guydawg	t1_ddyfups
t3_5v14n1	t1_ddyhdxi	1487550160	Exactly. The whole phone works. Just the home button doesn't work.	ScottMalgieri	t3_5v14n1

t3_5v14n1	t1_ddyjdld	1487552988	Are we to ignore the screen damage in the pic? Doesn't matter if the rest works, the buttons been damaged more than likely. But as with all glitches and bugs. Do the following. Reboot, restore as new-problem still exists? Take it in.	Rocko9999	t1_ddyfups
t3_5v0exx	t1_ddyjj7t	1487553200	Use a cable and PC. If you use google photos, delete the app before you delete the pics off your phone, because it syncs/mirrors what you do with your pics on the phone.	Rocko9999	t1_ddyf6b7
t3_5v0exx	t1_ddyk2a6	1487553946	If you delete them on your phone they'll still be available on GP, unless they haven't been uploaded yet.	mysticportal	t1_ddyjj7t
t3_5v0exx	t1_ddyk794	1487554129	Do you care about making albums and sorting? Because Google Photos just kinda throws everything in there unless they have proper date data. I would've paid for it but alphabetical sorting is nonexistent.	mysticportal	t1_ddyf8xx
t3_5v0exx	t1_ddym9dt	1487556983	Really? I just deleted pics off my phone and 30 sec later they are not in GP.	Rocko9999	t1_ddyk2a6
t3_5v0exx	t1_ddymopm	1487557578	Were they already uploaded/synced? I'm gonna try it out again right now.  Edit: Backup up a folder of pics, deleted them off in the stock Photos app, and are still available in Google Photos. Only iCloud Photos does the whole sync delete thing.	mysticportal	t1_ddym9dt

t3_5v14n1	t1_ddz2dvv	1487589903	Mine broke due to water damage (at least that's what I assume). I now use an onscreen accessibility home button. I actually quite like it.   No Touch ID is a pain though.   iPhone 6, so out of warranty.	Ajk137	t3_5v14n1

t3_5v0exx	t1_ddzb2ot	1487606546	Strange. I just did the same thing and it instantly deleted it from GP.	Rocko9999	t1_ddymopm
t3_5v0exx	t1_ddzl1e1	1487618430	Does everything look normal in your settings? Or try deleting them from GP. Select the photo/s, hit the options/3 dots, and choose delete device copy.	mysticportal	t1_ddzb2ot
t3_5v0exx	t1_ddzln12	1487619139	If I delete pic in GP, it prompts warning-will delete globally, and does. If I delete in IOS photos, it deletes instantly on GP. I assumed this was the normal action.	Rocko9999	t1_ddzl1e1
t3_5v14n1	t1_ddzpb2i	1487623396	Until you get it figured out or fixed, try using AssistiveTouch to substitute for the home button: open Settings then General then Accessibility, then scroll way down to AssistiveTouch and turn it on.  A White button will appear on the screen, and you can move the button to wherever you want along the edges of the screen.  Tap the white button and you'll have access to most of what the home button does.	RBXJ	t3_5v14n1

t3_5v7342	t1_ddzwbhj	1487631859	Get the IMEI number and know what carrier it's being used or was used on. Check the IMEI with the carrier to make sure it's all clear and not currently under a lease or financing or on someone's account. It can be clean but still active on someone's account and they can report it lost or stolen and then your screwed. The IMEI will be blacklisted.	Dallas2888	t1_ddzq6po
t3_5v7342	t1_ddzwpxo	1487632382	I brought it to tmobile and he said its good except i need to unlock for the sim to work on my carrier. With that being said, later on down the road, what happens if the seller reports it as stolen?	Hankipanky	t1_ddzwbhj
t3_5v7342	t1_ddzx35v	1487632860	If T-Mobile said it's clear and not actively being used on someone's account, then you'll be fine. Blacklisting happens if someone sells a phone still being leased or financed or tied to their account and after you buy it, down the road, report it stolen or lost. They get a new phone, and your cash and you get a device that will no longer activate on any carrier.	Dallas2888	t1_ddzwpxo
t3_5v7342	t1_ddzyjec	1487634800	Okay thank you for the help. So as long as its not blacklisted at this time, I am fine. I am only asking because I have heard of people reporting it stolen later and then you are held accountable.	Hankipanky	t1_ddzx35v
t3_5v7342	t1_de00li7	1487637616	If it's not active on someone's account and/or the phone is paid off through the carrier, you will be fine. A phone can still be used with your sim if it's still actively belongs to someone else, which is where they can report it lost or stolen to the carrier and it gets black listed. That's why you never buy from Craigslist. People sell phones to people who aren't paid off or they still belong to the carrier and then they report it lost or stolen days or weeks down the line and your screwed.	Dallas2888	t1_ddzyjec

t3_5v9f8p	t1_de0k51w	1487672955	It's not actually sending anything through a vpn, it sets up a "fake" one to route ad traffic through but because it doesn't exist the ads can't display.  Relevant bit from their faqs: "AdBlock for iOS DOES NOT affect the security of your connection in any way. It DOES NOT connect you to a VPN server and we DO NOT proxy any of your traffic. Since there is no proper VPN server to route connection between your device and the ad server, the ads are not being shown. Everything happens right on your iOS device."	mrt1981	t1_de0jton

t3_5vc06p	t1_de190fz	1487707971	That's basically what they're going for, but the reason some people are against it is it could work both ways. Your phone is locked and you lose it, someone gets ahold of it, takes it in get its unlocked, knows your information	WakaiSenshi	t1_de16qk0

t3_5ve2fl	t1_de1c49k	1487711211	Hmm, Im not sure who told you that Apple charges $3,000,000 to replace screens. That seems quite absurd. Its actually only $129, you get a genuine Apple screen, and you get a warranty in case of defects for one year.  Or, you know, jump on Amazon, buy some cheap screen from China that probably won't work, and break your phone in the process. These days, Apple is, as weird as it is, the best place for iPhone screen replacement for iPhone 6's and newer.	KrombopulosMichael23	t3_5ve2fl

t3_5vdlqa	t1_de1d7r9	1487712364	At least it says it doesn't on the box of the case. The brown ones box says 'this case develops its own patina' but the red one just says'specially tanned and finished leather'	therealduff1	t1_de1agf1
t3_5vdlqa	t1_de1dd4t	1487712511	I have no idea… but I dont mind the darker spots at all. It's a case, of course it isnt going to look brand new for ever.	Fantazy_cow	t1_de1d3ha
t3_5ve2fl	t1_de1df2f	1487712569	etradesupply.com you can get cheap or OEM screen and do the swap yourself. Just make sure to disconnect the battery first.	thinkdifferentlolz	t3_5ve2fl
t3_5vdlqa	t1_de1dx24	1487713092	Yeah of course. As long as my phone case isn't looking horrible I'm more than happy to use it. I just don't want to look like I've got a £3 when I paid £50 :p	therealduff1	t1_de1dd4t
t3_5vdlqa	t1_de1dy1i	1487713120	Maybe they didn't mean completely black, but the leather will wear off after a while. I believe there's black plastic underneath. Same goes for any leather product, they'll all get dark eventually. The silicone case is always an option.	mysticportal	t1_de1d3ha
t3_5vdlqa	t1_de1ec71	1487713532	That's true. But I've already returned the brown leather case and got this one😂, will they let me replace it again to a silicone one ?	therealduff1	t1_de1dy1i
t3_5vdlqa	t1_de1eqv8	1487713969	It's not turning black, its the pigment being worn away. Nothing you can do about it. That is why natural leather is the best color.	Rocko9999	t1_de1d3ha
t3_5vdlqa	t1_de1i7t1	1487717976	Wouldn't hurt to ask. Helps if you make the package look unopened.	mysticportal	t1_de1ec71
t3_5ve2fl	t1_de1il3i	1487718423	£126 for a new, GENUINE screen from Apple vs £90 for a crappy shit from a crappy service point, the choice is obvious here!  I strongly recommend replacing it at an Apple Store. I broke my screen last year, didn't want to pay the £20 extra and went to iMend (not recommended at all). They did replace my screen (they even came to my house), although it had shitty colours, was extremely unresponsive and everything that was displayed on it for longer than 5 mins was still visible on the screen (image retention).  So again, do yourself a favour and replace it at Apple!	Fizaraz	t3_5ve2fl

t3_5vc06p	t1_de1rv6d	1487730021	The thing is, this bill is suited just for you, a pro, or other repair shops. [The bill](https://nebraska.repair.org/) argues that currently as it is manufactures such as Apple and John Deere requires product owners to take anything that is broken to a shop the manufactures deem worthy to get a repair. And, all of the other shops that COULD repair them don't have access to the replacement parts or service manuals to support an independent repair. So, instead of getting OEM parts people like yourself have to turn to third party vendors to sell replacements that aren't to the quality or standards as the manufacturer originally designed them to be.   I agree that most everyone shouldn't be doing these repairs on their own unless they are skilled or have some know-how. However, I think that to some extent manufactures should support the shops and people who want to repair the ability to. Yes, it could open up the products to lack of stability, or "secrets" from being shared with repair manuals, and of course revenue to go away from repair licenses and the like... but it certainly wouldn't stop the devices from breaking any more than they already do... nor would it stop the people breaking them from buying new ones.	apassingremark	t1_de1mqw6
t3_5vc06p	t1_de1ry4i	1487730124	Yeah, for example Apple should sell repair parts to shops... oh wait they already do... Authorized Apple Service centers... they should just lower the requirements.	aspoels	t1_de1rv6d
t3_5vc06p	t1_de1sivy	1487730824	Your point is exactly what the bill's author takes issue with. Apple selling parts to companies that PAY them a fee to be deemed "authorized" is the issue. I get they want to control who has the ability to repair their goods. However, it is damaging to the owners of products who do not have a repair place nearby. As a society, we depend on more and more technology for everyday activities and when that technology fails getting it repaired would be the utmost importance. Having to rely on shops or businesses that aren't nearby to do this repair can be damaging to businesses and the like.   Now, I will side with Apple and other manufactures to require warranty work to be done by authorized shops as these types of repair require verification and compensation by the manufacture. However, once the device is out of warranty then it is fair game to who can do the repair.	apassingremark	t1_de1ry4i

t3_5vc06p	t1_de1x6mg	1487736858	I'm saying the vast majority of people should not be allowed to do this, as they'll screw things up even more then it already is, costing them more. It's better to just let people who know what they're doing do it.    Edit: I have had to tell sooo many people that they've bricked their device trying to fix it that I do believe that most people don't have the skill required to work on their phones. They'll still try to,, if the parts are accessible directly from the manufacturer.	aspoels	t1_de1x13v
t3_5vc06p	t1_de1xhpi	1487737311	This is not what the Right to Repair is trying to achieve. It's about getting fair access to parts and support from the manufacturers so they can't hang you by the balls whenever something goes wrong. It not only applies to phones but as technology advances and your dishwasher that has a $10 "proprietary" part that goes out or is damaged and the manufacturer will "fix it" by replacing the whole thing for half the cost of a brand new one, then you get have fair access to those parts and information on the repair.	Mr_Legit1	t1_de190fz

t3_5vc06p	t1_de21jxv	1487744341	Just as I own my car I own my phone and should be able to repair it as I please. If you restrict access to repairs to only authorized repair centers that pay to become authorized, they along with the original manufacturer create a monopolistic repair cycle that proves why this is needed. Just because some people are dumb and screw up doesn't mean some aren't smart and might learn a thing or two in repairing their products themselves. This provides the necessary tools for them to learn how to do it correctly. Just like cars had to do.	MetalGearFlaccid	t1_de2193z
t3_5vc06p	t1_de223f0	1487745475	What?   The Right to Repair is a law that says that manufactures like Apple must supply third-party shops with genuine parts from the source and provide instructions on how to repair. Locked iPhones are something different.	devopia	t1_de16hgc
t3_5vc06p	t1_de23bod	1487748331	But why do you get to decide what people can do? If they want to try it at their own risk, why do you think you have the right to dictate whether they can?  People screw up their own cars regularly. Some people learn the hard way. But they'll learn.	RampantAndroid	t1_de1x6mg
t3_5vc06p	t1_de25yg8	1487755487	What I don't understand, and maybe you can help me out with this, is why Apple or anybody else should be forced to sell a product. Like, if you want to go and replace your display with someone else's display, you can do that right now. If you want Apple's display, it makes sense you have to go to Apple for service.  Does that seem wrong? I'm genuinely curious why people think that's OK. And like I said, I may be missing something, so feel free to drop the knowledge bombs so to speak.  Similarly, unless I was misinformed, part of this bill is also releasing repair manuals to the general public. That's Apple's intellectual property. Same thing with the software they use to diagnose problems. You don't go to Microsoft and tell them to release Word to the general public for free. You don't go to Disney and told him to release beauty and the beast to the public for free. Similarly, you don't tell Lynda.com to release their training manuals for free. I don't see how you can force Apple to release their intellectual property to the public for free.  Those are my two biggest complaints. Like I said, I'm totally open to other arguments I just can't get over those two points yet.	quintsreddit	t1_de1sivy
t3_5vdlqa	t1_de26nm7	1487757513	Stop cleaning it. These are not supposed to be cleaned. You will never maintain a new look with the leather cases. They will all get the worn in patina over time. So pick one that either hides it (Black, midnight blue), or one that looks great with it (Saddle Brown).   If you don't like the above, and want a brand new looking case, you chose the wrong product.   Some people have used a silicone spray protectant to elongate the life of the new look, but cleaning will certainly remove the dye.	IsaoraAK	t3_5vdlqa
t3_5ve2fl	t1_de28uhe	1487764088	Yeah they've always been great with repairs.

t3_5vj5yv	t1_de2g8oo	1487776787	That's what I had thought! So when the imei checkers showed find my iPhone was on, and it still shows under iCloud.com but won't delete, I thought maybe it was actually off but apples site won't update/show it removed until it is re activated.

t3_5vj5yv	t1_de2iw3g	1487779944	If I'm understanding correctly, he tried logging into iCloud.com from his computer, and he couldn't turn off find my iPhone from there?  I've done that a few times for other people's phones/Apple Watch and haven't had that problem yet.	rsmseries	t3_5vj5yv
t3_5vj5yv	t1_de2iz8r	1487780045	This is in fact true. I ran into this issue when I was getting ready to send my iPhone back to Sprint during a trade in. I wiped and reset it before I realized I forgot I sign out of iCloud. Disabling find my iPhone doesn't sign you out of iCloud to remove it from your iCloud account. It simply disables that feature. I had to reopen the return kit and set up the trade in device all over again, sign in to iCloud and then sign out and reset and wipe it. Once the device is reset and wiped without signing out of iCloud, it will have it listed on your account, but since it's not active because it's been wiped, you can't remotely sign out because it doesn't have an active connection to that device anymore.

t3_5vj5yv	t1_de2jve4	1487781047	That's weird. Yeah if possible I'd try to meet at a public place and try to get everything worked out.	rsmseries	t1_de2j3hm
t3_5vj5yv	t1_de2ka9g	1487781509	The IMEI lock should be fine still, it is a database and should update when it gets wiped fully so you should be good on the unlock if it was done properly to begin with.	whoamanwtf	t1_de2j7a3
t3_5vj5yv	t1_de2mto1	1487784306	The IMEI lock will go through. You can still domestically carrier unlock it but you won't be able to set it up without having that activation lock removed and only the original owner can do that.	Dallas2888	t1_de2ka9g
t3_5vj5yv	t1_de2nn8n	1487785196	you should be good with everything else but i wouldn't give him the phone back for a few hours... i would go with him to re activate it.   that's why i bought mine from the apple store this time because you never know what bullshit the phone can have with the small time you're checking it out before buying it.	topfinesser	t3_5vj5yv

t3_5vj5yv	t1_de3lwz1	1487827185	This is not true, removing the device using find my iPhone from a computer will remove the iCloud activation lock. The iPhone needs to be turned off, and then you can remove it from iCloud.com by selecting the find my iPhone option. This is the exact same option used in an Apple Store if the iPhone is not turning on but the iCloud activation lock still needs removed.	Thrones1121	t1_de2iz8r
t3_5vj5yv	t1_de3p190	1487833125	the only reason I can think of that he requires the device back to remove FMIP is because of 2 factor authentication. the code is sent to the device and he may not have the trusted number anymore so his only option is the device itself or wait for account recovery.   IIRC he should be able to remove FMIP without the authentication code as long as he knows the password. If he forgots the password then it's either the device itself or account recovery.   without knowing what he actually says about the issue it's hard to tell but then again, after you remove FMIP through icloud you had to either restart the device or restore the device again to get it updated or something	fanofdota	t3_5vj5yv

t3_5vr3gp	t1_de5bc0l	1487916580	You build a project in an editing platform in 1080p and use the 4K footage. The result is a lot more latitude. The unfortunate thing is...it's still iPhone footage so the usual benefits of doing so with a good camera (color grading, additional definition, etc) is kinda moot. There will be a negligible difference in editing 1080p and downscaling to 1080 from 4K.  Simple Answer: By using 4K footage in a 1080p project, you get a lot more definition and detail than you would just importing regular 1080 into a 1080 project.	relativ_c	t1_de56q2c

Whatever price it stops on is the price of the app.  If the trail of blood has a moonlike curve, the app will have periodic discounts. If the chicken stops far away from the written prices, the app is free.

Link: https://readdle.com/blog/2015/06/how-we-handle-your-account-information-in-spark/  Excerpt: Spark’s server needs to check and send emails from your email account for these functions to work. And to achieve this, we need to store your email account’s access token. For services with OAuth authentication, like Gmail or Outlook, it’s special application specific token that you can revoke at any moment from your email account in the web.

t3_5wa543	t1_dea5ubm	1488215712	It's possible, but I think they'd have to do *something* to increase performance. I could see them bumping up the clock speed or making some other modifications to the A10, similar to the way they do for the iPad models (i.e. A9 for the phone, vs. A9X for iPad).    The iPad Pro revision is expected to get an A10X from what I've read (they have A9X currently). Maybe the 7S models will get that as well, or some variant of it designed to use a little less energy.    The rumors of a simultaneous release of 7S and 8 models seem pretty pervasive, so I'm *inclined* to believe them. But it would be a total departure from the way Apple has always done things before. It's uncommon for Apple to make any bold changes like that, but it's definitely possible. Offering two sizes of iPhone was a big change for example.    It's hard to say how they'd handle the processors since 7S &amp; 8 release at the same time is unprecedented, but I can't imagine a 7S that doesn't have a meaningful performance boost over the 7.    I'm hoping that Apple either offers OLED screens across the board or they don't price the 8 into the stratosphere. I miss having an OLED screen. If Apple delivers that OLED *and* a true dark mode in this new phones I will be very happy.	Fendahl_core	t3_5wa543
t3_5wa543	t1_dea64ei	1488216016	&gt; More power would be nice, but it's pointless unless the new chip can use less energy.  I can't recall a time when Apple has ever launched a new iPhone model that didn't have a faster SoC than the one it replaced. Generally these chips get more efficient too, i.e. deliver more performance with the same energy or less.    I don't see Apple breaking that trend by launching a 7S with the same A10 that's in the 7. It doesn't make sense. People expect a meaningful performance bump *and* some new features otherwise why would anyone upgrade? To get a red iPhone? Nah.	Fendahl_core	t1_de8if85
t3_5wa543	t1_dea6axh	1488216213	I don't disagree with you, but historically, the S line exists because people have staggered upgrade cycles. Apple certainly doesn't expect every apple user to upgrade every year, but certainly wants those upgrading on any year to be able to have something new to upgrade to. So a marginal performance bump wouldn't be out of line if the device had some other major feature, like an improved camera, wireless charging, or any of the other rumored features.	shapeshiftingrobot	t1_dea64ei
t3_5wa543	t1_dea6h39	1488216400	&gt;  S models have had bigger longevity in general.  This is why I always buy the S models. I also like the fact that it's given Apple more time to work the bugs out of the design. i.e. The 6S+ got a stronger chassis with a higher grade of aluminum to avoid bending.    The S models have typically felt "just right" to me. If these rumors of a simultaneous 7S &amp; 8 launch are true though it will give me something to think about. There are some features being teased that I have been waiting a long time for. OLED is a big one. So is a real change in the design. I liked the 5/5S design a lot. I'm not as big a fan of the 6/6s/7 slippery bar of soap design. If the 8 is significantly different in design and it's a big improvement, I could see myself breaking my rule there and going for the 8.	Fendahl_core	t1_de8jeno
t3_5wa543	t1_dea6xws	1488216898	That makes sense.    It seems like the typical performance bump is roughly 30-60% between generations. Maybe the 7S models will be on the low end of that and the 8 will be on the high end. My point was just that I don't see them releasing a 7S without a measurable bump in performance. That would be unprecedented. As good a job as Apple has done at keeping it's customers from focusing on clock speed and processor cores etc, they still want and expect an increase in overall performance with every new version, S or otherwise IMO.

t3_5wsqzy	t1_decqat6	1488339906	personally i stay away from these cases. In my experience something in the phone ALWAYS demagnetizes my cards. If you use Chips on your cards instead of swiping go for it but if you use ATMs id stay away as those need the stripe. cards using RFID would be fine as well. Just personally i dont think theyre a good idea. Plus if someone steals your phone they have all your cards and without your phone canceling the cards might be an issue	adjp15	t3_5wsqzy
t3_5wsqzy	t1_decqesi	1488340044	That's a good point. So far so good though - no demagnetization in the first couple of months of using this.	martin_keen	t1_decqat6

t3_5wsqzy	t1_decv6kg	1488347009	I've used them for years and never had a problem with demagnetization of credit cards. Only cards I have ever had an issue with being screwed up by a phone are hotel keys with magnetic strips. Those are made to be reused after they are turned in after your stay, so they are easy to overwrite the data on.	eastindyguy	t1_decqiou
t3_5wsqzy	t1_decva4s	1488347174	More than likely itbis heat related. I keep my license and one card in my wallet case and have never had an issue with the credit card getting demagnetized. I think I have been using wallet cases consistently since the iPhone 5.	eastindyguy	t1_decrjwp

t3_5wzez1	t1_dee1qyw	1488410194	My mom went from a 5s to the 6s+ and was fine with it after a few weeks. Everyone is uncomfortable with a bigger phone at first but then you get used to it. If she carries her phone in her purse always, it shouldn't be an issue. If she typically carries her phone in her pocket or occasionally travels without a purse, it could get really annoying. In that case the normal 7 would be the better option. I wouldn't go for the SE though. That's just my opinion.	PunnyYolks	t3_5wzez1
t3_5wzez1	t1_dee6vbk	1488416862	what i'm more concerned is the Jet Black finish.  That is a color option only justifiable if the owner purchases it, not as an assumption or gift. Maybe ask her first or go matte black?	OfficialHoSay	t3_5wzez1

t3_5wzez1	t1_deej54u	1488434332	I'm actually now thinking that you're probably right. A lot of people in the sub seem to really like the form factor of the SE.

t3_5x4jr3	t1_def5gk7	1488475842	because some people doesn't see big screen as a pull factor?	pw5a29	t3_5x4jr3
t3_5x4jr3	t1_def5mnc	1488476020	Lots of people love the 4s and 4 size. I know some people that still use them and not because they're poor either. I prefer the big + but that's just our individual preference.	jamiegandolf	t3_5x4jr3
t3_5x4jr3	t1_def66yg	1488476615	As someone who went from a 6 to an SE, here's my reasoning.  While the size doesn't seem like much, 4in phones make it much easier to reach all parts of the phone. My left thumb can reach the top right corner. Something that my 6 didn't have. My male pockets are deep, but I still prefer a smaller phone.  The keyboard keys are close enough together that it's easy (and faster for me) to type on, but not so tiny that you struggle (Blackberry.)  The 6s and SE share the same processor and back camera. The only thing worse on the SE is the front camera, and potentially, Force Touch. The front camera is still able to take relatively decent photos, and not many people care about Force Touch.  The SE is $250 cheaper. A lot of people are on BYOD plans, having to shell out the full price of the phone. They have no option to pay $30 a month for the phone. Also, $18 a month for a phone is easier than $30 for some people as well.  The battery life on the SE is so much better than the 6s. I can go almost two days on mine where my boyfriend can only go a day on his 6s.  The SE is the design a lot of people love. Especially coming from a 5/5c/5S. The blockiness is incredibly comfortable. Some people hate the camera bump as well.  The SE has way fewer problems than the 6s did. Battery issues plagued the 6s, but the SE didn't have any issues. The 7 peels, but if they used the same SE case, it wouldn't. Now, this is because Apple saw how the [5's body took damage](https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/iphone-5-scuffs-640x353.jpg) and fixed it for the most part. The 5s' shiny border around the screen ended up looking terrible after some use, so they went matte for the SE.  *******  I would love for an SE to come out with next generation hardware. The perfect SE would have Force Touch and 128gb/256gb options. Apple didn't really expect the SE to do as well as it did, but there's a market for smaller phones (See: Galaxy S Mini series.)	ScrewSnow	t3_5x4jr3
t3_5x4jr3	t1_def69d7	1488476686	Even with small hands, it's easy to reach every corner of the iPhone SE screen with one hand. There's a reason Apple had to introduce the Reachability feature when they announced the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.  Aside from that, I think the shape also makes it a lot easier to hold. The iPhone 6, 6s, and 7 are all very slippery compared to the previous models. I've had a couple close calls where my larger iPhones have almost slipped out of my hand, but I never had that problem with the 4" and smaller models.	greatcaffeine	t3_5x4jr3
t3_5x4jr3	t1_def6q0h	1488477172	Not really though? This is entirely up to personal opinion. The build quality and form factor of the SE is great, but the 7 has a better screen-to-body ratio.	AnAttractivePenguin	t1_def5zu2
t3_5x4jr3	t1_def7959	1488477730	For me, one handed use on the SE is significantly better than a 4.7". I can reach all parts of the screen easily and comfortably on the SE. On a 4.7" it's a bit of a strain to touch some spots and a balancing act to get to the opposite upper corner.    The SE has some straight advantages over the other iPhones too. It's the cheapest iPhone, gets better battery life than any 4.7" iPhone, and charges the fastest of any iPhone (fastest to 100% of any phone period). Also has a headphone jack, unlike the 7.	redphan	t3_5x4jr3
t3_5x4jr3	t1_def7veh	1488478392	I currently have a Galaxy S7 and am planning to switch to an SE in the near future. It will be my first iPhone. Mostly agree with your points, but I'll add:  * The SE seems much better suited for working out and running because of it's size. I feel like I could get one of those arm bands for it and forget I'm even carrying a phone * It's the most affordable iPhone, yet still seems to have better performance (perceived, at least) than my S7 * I don't really need a big phone. I've had big phones and they're really awkward for most of the stuff I use a phone for, e.g. streaming music, texting my wife, grocery lists, email, news, calendar. I've dropped my S7 many times because I was trying to use it one-handed and it slipped out of my hand. The main argument for big screens is games and video, but if I want to play games or watch video, I have numerous game consoles/handhelds (with better games, but I digress), a smart TV, and a tablet. * It's a classic design. It's like if Porsche brought out a new 911 "Classic" that looked like [this](http://911evolution.com/sites/default/files/styles/header_image_medium/public/media/Turbo_0/1986-Porsche-911-Turbo_edited.jpg?itok=ptEgyxV0) but had modern technology, safety features, infotainment systems, etc and cost 20% less than a current model 911. There would be a strong niche of people who would buy the shit out of that.	mdm_	t1_def66yg
t3_5x4jr3	t1_def83qi	1488478640	Because different people have different tastes. You may think the difference between 4" and 4.7" is negligible, but to other people it's that difference that makes the phone more pocketable or ergonomic.	mmaireenehc	t3_5x4jr3

t3_5x4jr3	t1_defbhff	1488482203	Size and price are big reasons why people prefer the SE over the larger iPhones.  Depending the size of ones hands, mere inches means the difference between a phone meant for one handed use and a phone that needs to be used with two hands. Also, as I never use an iPhone without a case, a case would increase the size even more.    I bought a 64GB SE back in May 2016 and upgraded from a 5s. For me it is the perfect size (you can use the phone one handed which comes in handy if your carrying say a briefcase in your other hand). It has the exact same dimensions as the 5 and 5s which means there was already a huge array of accessories that would fit it (including cheap accessories that were marked down in price or sold used for cheap, which allowed me to buy all of my Olloclip lenses made for the 5/5s cheap. It meant I could reuse my Spigen Tough Armor case that I had for my 5s that I love. It meant I could keep using my favorite Marware leather hip case which fits it perfectly. The SE has the same CPU/GPU and rear camera as the 6s (which actually performs a little better since it doesn't have to drive the same sized screen as the 6s.) The battery life was/is the best of any iPhone. It cost less than the the 6s/6s Plus. True the SE doesn't have Force Touch but as I never had it I don't miss it. It doesn't have the better front facing camera as the 6s/7 but as I don't take many selfies (I'm not a teenage girl) that doesn't matter.  Don't get me wrong, there are times I would love to have a larger screen (like when my iPhone is docked in my car and I am using the GPS Navigation) but it's not worth the size tradeoffs to me.

t3_5vxgb5	t1_deg2pla	1488514960	Hi /r/iphone! My name's Amanda, and I just released what I think is a pretty cool app on the iOS store. It's called "Alerts for Reddit" (and yes, the idea was approved by the folks at Reddit!)  The basic idea is that you can sign up for iOS notifications for your favorite subreddits, so you can get alerts whenever a post quickly rises to the top of a subreddit. For example, I use it for /r/worldnews and /r/news so that I never miss a breaking news story. You could also use it for a smaller subreddit, so that you don't have to check it as often - just get a notification whenever a new post rises to the top!  So, if you're interested, please check it out ([apple store link here](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1208773745)) and let me know what you think! :) I know the look&amp;feel of the app is a bit rough - it's my first time publishing an app, and I'm looking to improve that piece over time - but the functionality is in place and working great!  (P.S. sorry for the throwaway account - because my real name is on the app store, and I have some personal details shared on my main reddit account, I decided not to link the two.)	notifications_app	t3_5vxgb5

Your phone will forever be stuck on Edge and 3G (HSPA+) while on GSM networks. (T-Mobile uses those same LTE bands (plus Band 2)) so moving to another sub carrier like metroPCS wouldn't solve it.

t3_5x8phz	t1_degk54a	1488552684	^^^^ This x1000.  The iPhone 5 was the last for awhile where LTE capabilities were not equal across most devices.  With each new model, the iPhones supported more LTE bands on fewer different models and the 6s/6s Plus was the "universal" model.  Unfortunately, no configuration changes, software updates, or anything else will help.  It's like if you wanted to listen to an FM radio station and your radio only has an AM tuner.  You'll either need to switch to the Verizon-backed Straight Talk plan (if I remember correctly, they offer service backed by all the major carriers), or switch to Verizon proper (prepaid or postpaid) if you want to use that phone to its fullest.	ecs0013	t1_degc3mc

t3_5xijtz	t1_deipbpy	1488676217	No. Most of them don't have curved glass so they can only cover the perfectly flat part of the front. If they are slightly bigger than that or you get the alignment even slightly off, this will happen.	Rawmin	t1_deimnaz

t3_5xijtz	t1_deiqzxp	1488678812	Guys.... This has nothing to do with the protector.  Every phone is different and some start to curve a little earlier than others. If you are unlucky then it will start a bit to early and the edge of the protector will not make good enough contact. Its luck of the draw.  Some protectors have thicker adhesive than others, thicker adhesive can help with this.	x3n0n1c	t3_5xijtz
t3_5xijtz	t1_deirmvt	1488679803	I'm not saying it's impossible to scratch. I'm saying I don't subject my phone that would scratch it unless it's completely accidental and those instances would likely not be negated by a simple screen protector.   I have a day 1 iPhone 6 and it's not scratched. My previous phones didn't have cases or protectors and were also in good shape.	HLef	t1_deiq8i0
t3_5xijtz	t1_deirozp	1488679893	This is the real advice. They're way cheaper and are probably the best I've ever used. Any type I've ever used always seems to have some sort of issue so I'm just chalking it up to lack of user skill. However the maker ones are cheap enough that if you do mess it up it's not devastating to get another.   I always have on on my phone and I've never had a real issue with anker and I *abuse* my poor phone.	juttep1	t1_deidclj
t3_5xijtz	t1_deirw0j	1488680193	And that's fine, I can replace the screen protector for a few bucks; a scratch on the phone itself and it loses resale value and I can't trade it in for a new one a year later.	kerbuffel	t1_deipt3d

t3_5xijtz	t1_deiufb7	1488683944	Actually not really. I purchased a belkin screen protector from amazon for my i7+ and took it to the Apple Store. They applied it free of charge.

t3_5xijtz	t1_deiv7a4	1488685010	Okay, you seem to genuinely have no idea how they work, so allow me to explain!  How doe a bicycle helmet work? The helmet takes most of the energy from the crash and breaks, thus dispersing the energy before it reaches your skull and cracks it open.  The same applies to your phone screen. The screen protector absorbs the energy and it cracks, sparing your screen from a lot of the energy.   By your logic an unshatterable screen protector would be better, which just isn't true. That screen protector wouldn't shatter and the energy would go to your screen, which would then break under the force.  As for the scratches, well, first of all, the tempered screen protectors are made of a glass like material and are actually pretty hard to scratch. They do, however, scratch, by nothing more than your phone screen would if you didn't use one. Oh and they also pick up less fingerprints!  I'd rather replace my screen protector once every couple of months, instead of having to replace the screen of my iPhone because it is scratches. If I had to send it in for replacement af the phone company, I'd have to pay the insurance fees and wait for it to arrive back to me.  I think I'll choose to spend 50€ every once in a while, instead (Europe, our prices are fucked)	FrederikTwn	t1_deipt3d
t3_5xijtz	t1_deivzw4	1488686299	Every phone I've ever seen with a screen protector was otherwise trashed. I don't know, I have never needed one.	HLef	t3_5xijtz

t3_5xijtz	t1_dej02kk	1488693325	My brother purchased a relatively pricey one and got a two pack. His were so bad. As I run a small, local shop here, I order mine wholesale pretty cheap. No name brands, by they work damn well. Stay in great, and saved my phone quite a few times!	doglover129	t3_5xijtz
t3_5xijtz	t1_dej087a	1488693596	I had that one and honestly didn't like it. Yes they have the absolute best solution for applying them, but they're the only screen protectors I've come across that don't actually cover the edges of the screen. Yes, none of them go to the edge of the glass panel, but the belkin has like 1mm strips of bare screen on both sides, and that absolutely pissed me off so I ripped it off after a month.

t3_5xijtz	t1_dej270k	1488697896	Lol wut? That's not how it works at all lol. What the good screen protectors do is spread out the energy from the point of impact besides just protecting your screen from scratches. It shouldn't shatter... I have yet to see.

This app used to be called [Pomodoro Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id966415847), but we had to change it for legal reasons. You'll notice on the app store that many of the top pomodoro apps no longer include 'pomodoro' in their title.  Localizing the app for new languages entails a lot of iOS simulator &amp; device testing. Luckily I was able to use fastlane snapshot for phone screenshots, but I had to manually generate my localized watch screenshots.

t3_5xijtz	t1_dejgq1d	1488733395	iPhones are made to incredibly tight tolerances. The difference in curve would be fractions of a millimetre. It's small enough to be completely irrelevant.	lMETHANBRADBERRY	t1_deiqzxp

t3_5xijtz	t1_deji4rr	1488735406	I think iphone screens are curved differently, my 6s had halo around the tempered glass while my friend's didn't eventhough we got the same tempered glass.	Davcoss	t3_5xijtz
t3_5xijtz	t1_deju9oj	1488752239	&gt; I'm saying I don't subject my phone that would scratch it  Well screen protectors aren't manufactured specifically for you. You asked what they protect against, not why you yourself should get one.  &gt; completely accidental and those instances would likely not be negated by a simple screen protector.   How not? If it were put in a pocket with keys, for example, the keys might scratch the protector but not the screen.	Rawmin	t1_deirmvt

t3_5xijtz	t1_dek9tox	1488774453	Well, no, that's not your point though. It's not about you.  Look back, you said you didn't know what they were supposed to protect *your* phone from.  If all you wanted to do was puff up about how super-dee-duper careful you are, then congratulations, I guess? But you and your habits aside, screen protectors protect screens, and tempered glass ones are a better product.	Rawmin	t1_dek8p9w
t3_5xrix8	t1_dekefzb	1488783502	I can see it being usable until Q3 2018. Personally holding out for the iPhone 8 as my next upgrade (after a battery replacement).	murtadi007	t3_5xrix8
t3_5xrix8	t1_dekeo9e	1488784075	What phone are you coming from? If you can handle the comically small screen, the SE would be a better buy. The 6 does still have a few years left in it though I’d wager.	AreWeNotDoinPhrasing	t3_5xrix8
t3_5xrix8	t1_dekf2f2	1488785062	You probably wouldn’t like the SE then. I’d say go for the 6, it’ll easily last 2 years if you’re buying new. Also should be supported by apple for at least those 2 years, maybe more.	AreWeNotDoinPhrasing	t1_dekf1ct
t3_5xrix8	t1_dekfe4f	1488785913	Yeah it will be fine. My brother has been using his iPhone 6 since December 2015 and he's had no issues of slowdowns or reboots.   You'll manage fine. Please get the 64GB model at least. You'll kill yourself getting 16GB only.	avEmonsta	t3_5xrix8
t3_5xrix8	t1_dekj02h	1488796818	The model they are selling is a 32gb. I'm not sure, but looks like apple is making a 32 gb version now and maybe phasing out the 16?	gen_mayhem	t1_dekfe4f
t3_5xrix8	t1_dekj29u	1488797019	Ye that's right. 32GB gold model but last i heard it's being released to [select Asian carriers](https://9to5mac.com/2017/03/03/apple-iphone-6-gold-32-gb-model-available-select-asian-carriers/) only though. It's not being sold by Apple retail.	avEmonsta	t1_dekj02h
t3_5xrix8	t1_deklq5d	1488804446	I don't think it will be supported until 2020 at all, while my 6 runs well now on ios 10, I suspect with the next update it will start to slow abit.   That being said, for it to last until 2020 that would mean support for 6 years which I think is a stretch.	Snafu80	t3_5xrix8
t3_5xrix8	t1_dekm63f	1488805410	hmmm. Yes I agree, 6 years is probably a stretch given tech life cycles today. Is upgrading compulsory or can I choose to remain on the current OS for as long as I like?	gen_mayhem	t1_deklq5d
t3_5xrix8	t1_deknobs	1488808298	Honestly I'd look on Craigslist, Letgo, or Offerup for a decently used 6s or 7.  You can get a 6s now for ~$200-300 USD.	scrizewly	t3_5xrix8
t3_5xrix8	t1_deknqds	1488808396	Although iOS certainly does get pretty pushy about it, Apple doesn't "force" you to update unless you do a factory reset in iTunes.	scrizewly	t1_dekm63f

t3_5xrix8	t1_dekpk2q	1488811349	Apple covers the device for the full first year regardless of the amount of owners, in my experience.  I'm on a 2nd owner iphone 7+, my son is on a 4th owner iphone 6s+.  The 6s+ just had 2 rounds of screen replacements which were covered under warranty and is about to go for a third which wont' be covered (shattering).	scrizewly	t1_dekomuf
t3_5xrix8	t1_dekpzq5	1488811984	Personally I think the 6 is really starting to show its age, the processor is pretty slow and it's the last iPhone with 1gb of ram so that can be annoying how often apps reload.	PleaseGoOutside	t3_5xrix8

t3_5xwp1j	t3_5xwp1j	1488841859	Is the iPhone 8 really going to be curved screen like the galaxy's?	Mtking105	-1
t3_5xwp1j	t1_delfvsr	1488842725	This already happens with the 6/6S/7 models, they have curved glass around the display and no screen protector properly deals with that. Most cheap ones ignore the curvature and are smaller than the display, and the ones that do curve end up messing with cases and creating sharp edges around the phone.   If you don't use a case and screen protector though this curves are amazing, they make swiping so smooth and satisfactory.	kadupse	t3_5xwp1j
t3_5xwp1j	t1_delg9ut	1488843242	No it doesn't, literally no screen protector would work for my S7, for my iPhone I go to Walmart and pick up a cheap 10$ brand tempered glass, install it, no bubbles or lifting. It doesn't go all the way to the curves but it doesn't have that awful halo effect.	Mtking105	t1_delfvsr
t3_5xwp1j	t1_delgrme	1488843903	most rumors have said the curve is not nearly as dramatic as samsung's. It will probably be very similar to the current iphone's curved glass which isn't bad at all. Also only the most expensive phone is going to have the curve, just buy the cheaper 7s if it's an issue	dackwarbs	t3_5xwp1j
t3_5xvjel	t1_delgv0v	1488844033	that won't help you fix the problem or get your money back though. I see people get scammed with iCloud locked devices all the time. it's frustrating but preventable.	teedoff087	t1_del9mnr
t3_5xwp1j	t1_delgxay	1488844116	So there's going to be a 7S and iPhone 8 to?	Mtking105	t1_delgrme

t3_5xwp1j	t1_delhfyj	1488844815	While that is true, I would be slightly concerned if iPhone screens become curved like the S7. One major difference between the devices is that the actual "screen" (the display, and not the just the glass) is curved on the S7 and presumably the upcoming S8. This causes the image seen to be distorted since the glass is curved along with the display panel. It also creates some annoying light reflections and glares while looking at the edges of the display. On the other hand, the iPhone's display is actually completely flat and while the glass is slightly curved at the edges, it doesn't deter from the viewing experience.	e0rt	t1_delfvsr

t3_5xwp1j	t1_delhn2w	1488845081	Oh yeah, I agree. I don't like when the display itself is curved, it creates some weird glare and some color artifacts. I was just replying specifically to the screen protector issue, which is one we already have.	kadupse	t1_delhfyj
t3_5xwp1j	t1_delir8q	1488846611	it's all rumor of course, but yes, it's very likely that there are 3 models. A 7s, 7s Plus, and a 10th anniversary iphone. I don't think it would be called the iphone 8	dackwarbs	t1_delgxay
t3_5xvjel	t1_deljtms	1488848032	Ikr, i got a killer deal on it. 110 and the only problem was the screen was cracked. Very little wear to the body.	GHDefence	t1_delhks5

t3_5xz2gc	t1_delzsse	1488873407	*do this at your own risk*  Gently twist the frame of your phone with both hands on top and bottom. If this causes the ghost touching to stop, start or get worse then it's probably because the 6 model iPhones suffer from a TouchIC issue in which Apple didn't put underfil on the TouchIC chip so over time with random bumps and drops the chip loses connection with the motherboard due to the shock to a chip with no foundation to support it and causes this issue.

I would say, do the 6S, and consider investing in some cloud storage. Buy iCloud for 99¢ a month and get Google Photos. If you listen to music, only use streaming services or get iTunes Match.

t3_5xz2gc	t1_denth2b	1488980453	Ghost clicking is when your phone screen is frozen but the phone is functioning on its own (opening/closing apps, calling a contact, typing random characters), even if you're not physically touching your screen.

t3_5xz2gc	t1_denxa28	1488985816	Try replacing the screen. If it still occurs, it does sound like a touch IC problem.   If that is the case, you should definitely consider upgrading to a 6S because the Apple replacement means they're gonna replace your motherboard and the problem will happen again further down the line because it's a design defect with the metal used on the 6's body.   You could also send it to a professional third party repair store like iPad Rehab who specializes in these types of repair and will (maybe) future proof your touch IC by creating a cage around it so it can't lift away from the motherboard.

The battery on the 6 was at 50% by the end of the day whereas the 6S was at 30%.  No raise to wake on the 6, and it was pretty amazing -- I didn't realize how annoying that feature was and turned it off on my 6S.   I don't use 3D touch, I find it useless, and it has been turned off on my 6S and doesn't exist on my 6 in the first place, so it was a wrap.   Get the 6 64GB. If you need a battery replacement, get it, but not only does it cost less, it has more space. You won't regret it.	OptionalCookie	t3_5y64j2

t3_5yfr8a	t1_depxmcx	1489086842	the buttons on the 7+ case are ~~plastic~~ aluminum and integrated into the case (very high quality) and make it much easier to press the buttons. I don't know how they'll hold up over time compared to the pressure-molded ones on the previous cases.  the old case in the photo didn't color like mine did.

t3_5yh1be	t1_depxpjp	1489086932	You're locked in until you pay off your phone. If you do that according to the regular schedule, that will take 24 months. You can pay it off early if you want. Alternately, if you've paid off at least 50% of the total and it's been at least 6 months since you started the program, you can trade your phone in and start a new iPhone Upgrade Program contract on the next version of the phone. But you don't have to do this if you don't want.	Arpisti	t3_5yh1be

So with apple, you can pay 50% of it off for at least 6 months, then you can get a new phone and start 24 months over again ... NOT having to pay the rest of the first upgraded phone off?

t3_5yh1be	t1_deq3sk9	1489093220	The only real two downsides are, if your situation changes then you're not guaranteed to be placed it program again. So just cause you qualify now won't mean you'll qualify next time. Like each time is a whole new loan.   And if you must upgrade on launch day of next iPhone, you'll likely have problems. Supply and demand stuff, Apple won't reserve one for you on launch day cause you're in the program. A ton of people were surprised and shocked by having issues using the program during last launch. A month or two after launch and no problems but right at launch, problems.	Docster87	t1_deq21z9
t3_5yh1be	t1_deq4b1e	1489093728	Ah that's cool with me, having to wait a month or two after new launch is fine.  Although now that I'm going to be buying a much larger (128GB vs 16GB) phone, I don't know if I'll need to upgrade as much.	snowgrammer	t1_deq3sk9

t3_5ym88n	t1_der61uu	1489157625	Why not just buy the SIM free iPhone from Apple?	Jig5	t3_5ym88n
t3_5ym88n	t1_der6syt	1489158595	SIM free either full-price or through the iPhone Upgrade Program is the way to go, as this doesn't really involve the carriers at all, so your porting process is completely independent.  If you get a SIM free phone, it will be unlocked and work on Verizon and T-Mobile.  Apple maintains the iPhone lock/unlock database and so if you buy from them, have all the records of purchase, you'll be less likely to have any sort of issue.  This is also good if you have a warranty swap, it will ensure the replacement is also unlocked.  In terms of porting, it's a matter of ordering the SIMs or visiting a T-Mobile store and that process should take a couple of hours at most.  The nice thing about having the S6 and iPhone at the same time is that you can leave the S6 on Verizon and the iPhone on T-Mobile when you're in "mixed service" (calls may come and go from both during the port process) and then eventually the S6 will have no service.  You could sell it or keep it as a backup (no Band 12 isn't great in some areas, but for other areas it's certainly tolerable).  I can't speak to this from personal experience, but I'm guessing if you do anything through Verizon, there's a chance you might get hit with an upgrade fee or something else.  Personally, I've really become a fan of avoiding any carrier for things other than the service itself, and going through Apple for my devices.	ecs0013	t3_5ym88n
t3_5ym88n	t1_der6vfv	1489158681	You can get the sim free (unlocked) version at Apple.  Those phones work on both GSM and CDMA and will stay unlocked no matter what carrier you use, although you might wanna check this thread:  T-Mobile locked my factory unlocked iPhone 7 and won't unlock it. Apple does not care.  https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/5y9m8k/tmobile_locked_my_factory_unlocked_iphone_7_and/  You can also get the Verizon variant which comes with the Qualcomm processor. All Verizon phones come unlocked out of the box so you should be able to just pop your T-mobile sim card in and you're good to go.	MntyBntz	t3_5ym88n

t3_5ym88n	t1_der8h7r	1489160607	I saw that post when doing a search on the topic.  I don't think I saw where it was confirmed that tmobile improperly locked it.  I dont doubt the seller said it was unlocked but I didn't recall seeing a model number posted that could have confirmed what was actually sold.  It'seems probably an unpopular opinion but if iit was a universal model that locked to the first sim used per it's programming, the error is with the seller and not tmobile.	Aliwithani	t1_der6vfv

You really think an app as widely used as Facebook is putting out extra updates just to try and mess with reviews?  The vague changelogs are probably because they do a lot of ABX testing, and/or to figure out how easily their users discover new features	MrTomnus	t1_deqjm82
t3_5ym88n	t1_der8sbz	1489160965	I didn't think you could sign up for the turn in plan on a similar free phone.  I'm not a big fan of the financing as I've gotten used to having to pay out of pocket for a phone to keep u limited data after the last time verizon Killdeer the plan before bring back their newest version.    I was more interested in streamlining the upgrade process and not having to deal with selling old devices.	Aliwithani	t1_der61uu
t3_5ym88n	t1_der92cb	1489161292	Thank you! I had totally forgot the possibility of having verizon add on activation fees to the phone.  There has to be a way around that since people buy them as gifts.  I mean you can't activate a Christmas gift on black Friday or add fees to someone's plan and ruining the surprise.      Will they let you adapt sim free device to the apple upgrade plan?  I thought it was full purchase price only.	Aliwithani	t1_der6syt
t3_5ym88n	t1_der9jzm	1489161850	I didn't even realize that - it looks like it might be carrier-specific, so if you aren't going full-price, getting it while on Verizon may make sense.  At worst, you could always ask someone at the Apple Store what can and cannot be done.  (I bought my SE outright at the Apple Store after selling an iPhone 6, so I can't speak about the upgrade program - they just handed me the sealed box and sent me on my way.)	ecs0013	t1_der92cb
t3_5ym88n	t1_derczh1	1489165623	It does look like that model is excluded from the website but who knows what may happen in store.  They can get commission on it if they don't tie it to a plan so that's probably why it's excluded.      I don't mind doing paying outright for a verizon or unlocked phone as it will be mine and I can switch between however many carriers I want without having to switch phones. I also like the upgrade plan since it simplifies the upgrade process and it means I don't have to deal with selling the old device.  I would even pay a small premium if the offered the unlocked device on the turning plan.	Aliwithani	t1_der9jzm
t3_5ym88n	t1_dergzbq	1489170021	How long ago did you have your iPhone on T-Mobile?  They'll unlock it for you after it's been on a plan for a certain amount of days if the phone is paid off (which technically it is since you didn't get it from them).  I want to say 40 days but I don't remember off the top of my head.	rsmseries	t1_der6vfv
t3_5ym88n	t1_derok5o	1489178431	The OP in that thread later said that the seller might have bought it at one of the retailers and was just under the impression that it was factory unlocked.	Yo_2T	t1_der6vfv

t3_5yqgq4	t1_des5mj4	1489201337	My experience with the Pixel left me with the conclusion that it's just an iPhone 6 that runs Android and loves Google. Some will disagree, but I would never trade in an iOS device for the Pixel. If you buy an iPhone 7 I recommend the Plus model (1080p rendered at 3x and with a greater dpi compared to the the slightly above 720p of the normal size). Nothing currently can compare with the power of the iPhone 7, however things like design are very subjective, I particularly love the new black colors but hate the camera bump.   Oh, and the iPhone 7 is got true security, hardware enforced at that, something the Pixel is the opposite of.	kadupse	t3_5yqgq4

t3_5yr8dh	t1_desf290	1489220421	I've found the silicon ones great, but they're kind of difficult to get into your pocket if you're wearing slightly tight jeans. Small issue but it gets more annoying over time.	wheels2	t1_desehbc

t3_5yr8dh	t1_desghju	1489225180	I doubt it'll feel like leather. Having used a different silicone case before; it will definitely pick up dust and lint.

t3_5yqgq4	t1_dessch1	1489252045	I have both the iPhone 7+ and the Pixel XL. Both are great phones. Right now using my Pixel XL as my daily driver. The only thing that I miss is iMessage but that is all.   Every time I go back to the iPhone , I miss my Pixel. I've been using iPhones since the 3Gs. I would switch OS every once in a while. I had the Moto Droid, HTC Thunderbird, Galaxies phones. But I would always go back to iOS.   Now with the Pixel, it is different. I love the phone. To me, iOS got boring. I'm just waiting for iOS 11 to be different and also the iPhone 7s or 8.   It really depends on the person. Both phones are great.	musicjcmerrr	t3_5yqgq4
t3_5yqgq4	t1_desv9e9	1489256146	You must be the only person in the world who thinks Android notifications are inferior to iOS. The rest of your comments are personal opinion.

t3_5yqgq4	t1_desvmno	1489256636	How on earth does the Pixel equal the iPhone 6 when it has a far superior camera and screen? I know this is an Apple sub but that's a ridiculously biased comment.	PluckyPorcupine	t1_des5mj4
t3_5yqgq4	t1_desw4gx	1489257309	Calm down, buddy. While Apple's badge app icons are pretty subjective, I find that they make it easier to keep track of things. Plus I just prefer small things like swiping to open the app instead of double tapping	wheatencross1	t1_dess4le
t3_5yfr8a	t1_deswko3	1489257933	Same with mine. I ended up exchanging it for a silicone case (stone grey I think). Which has held its colour much better. That reminds me I have a voucher for the difference I still need to spend.	dshipp	t1_deqbaiu
t3_5yqgq4	t1_deswqnt	1489258157	Far better screen? Using a diamond pentile subpixel matrix? Still suffering from burn-in? No thanks.   But the camera is indeed better, that what two years of development gives you (Although the lack of OIS is a joke for the price).   If you want an Android that's fine, get an OnePlus 3, or even the Note 7 (If it didn't have the battery issues) but the Pixel is just unjustifiable.	kadupse	t1_desvmno
t3_5yu3ua	t1_deswqpb	1489258159	I would imagine they would fix the issue, rather than replacing the entire phone.	AriCode	t3_5yu3ua
t3_5yqgq4	t1_deswy3z	1489258438	My reasoning for switching to Pixel was because it's made by Google, it's stock Android, snappy, and gets updated immediately.	wheatencross1	t1_deswqnt
t3_5yqgq4	t1_desx0hu	1489258524	I guess maybe because I think I'll grow to like it? Idk. Maybe I'll stick with the iPhone, but Apple's increasing pretentiousness is irritating	wheatencross1	t1_desa4nz
t3_5yu3ua	t1_desx7ou	1489258795	It doesn't make a difference. The difference is jf you're going to pay for it	L0veToReddit	t3_5yu3ua
t3_5yqgq4	t1_desxlyv	1489259360	Maybe you will. But I realized I prefer iOS over any fancy hardware or features. I had a galaxy s7 but it made a few disappointing compromises such as the water proof and poor speaker. I really like stock Android as it is a nice change but still prefer iOS overall. I get the best of both sides on iOS. Also people will most likely adapt to Apples drastic changes over time.	akareeno	t1_desx0hu
t3_5yqgq4	t1_desypfv	1489260917	So all the very best reviewers on the internet and on YouTube ( MKBHD, Erica Griffin, Michael Fisher etc etc )  are all wrong when they say the Pixel and Pixel XL are arguably the best smartphone experiences you can buy along with the iPhone 7 and we should instead listen to you oh wise Oracle who claims it's no better than an iPhone 6...I understand Apple users love their products ( they are great, I own several ) but maybe take your blinkers off and have an open mind.Other companies make good stuff too.	PluckyPorcupine	t1_deswqnt
t3_5yqgq4	t1_desyy1w	1489261268	Erica Griffin claimed the top and bottom bezels on the iPhone 6 were ugly, useless and Apple is long due into changing to smaller bezels... When the Pixel came she said "I miss bigger bezels like the ones in the Pixel" claiming that some people find them ugly but they're great for holding the phone in landscape. Cool, so if Apple does it it's a design failure but if Google does it's amazingly useful. She also complained that the smaller iPhone 6 had no OIS, but on the Pixel that's fine, sure.   People are hyped up because this is a Google phone, so Google is controlling the hardware and software which solves some of the issues of the Android ecosystem, that's nice, but let's evaluate the device by the same standards we have with all others.  Also, I've seen many reviewers saying they were disappointed with the Pixel, so I don't think your argument is that great as it depends heavily on one person's opinion. And in the case of Erica, whether or not there's a Google logo on the phone.	kadupse	t1_desypfv
t3_5yu3ua	t1_det05li	1489263026	Apple doesn't really fix iPhones for hardware issues, they only replace. However, it has to be under their 1-year warranty!  Check if the iPhone is still under warranty [here](https://checkcoverage.apple.com/us/en/)	Modytt	t3_5yu3ua
t3_5yu3ua	t1_det411d	1489268689	It's not under warranty :/ I talked with someone from support and they said I could replace it for $300 or get it repaired, but they couldn't tell me for certain if it could be repaired or how much it would be.	danniro	t1_det05li
t3_5yu3ua	t1_det4uhv	1489269872	I once took my old iPhone 5s and I had replaced the screen but also didn't have Touch ID working. Pretty much they told me they could fix it but they would be replacing the screen, so it'd be that price. Price of a screen replacement.	hervadore	t3_5yu3ua

t3_5yu3ua	t1_det5cju	1489270617	Yeah I know it isn't in issue with the screen it's an issue with the Touch ID sensor itself. The Touch ID can only be fixed by Apple due to security. I was just saying you'll probably be charged the price of a screen replacement.	hervadore	t1_det58fv
t3_5yu3ua	t1_det5jhs	1489270901	I think it's more than that, but yeah I sad NAH and left it how it was. I'd always take it to Apple just to verify.	hervadore	t1_det5gb0
t3_5yu3ua	t1_det5tdg	1489271307	Man that's so disappointing. I'm really torn right now because I could return this phone (which is in near pristine condition otherwise) and pay $13 more for a phone in worse cosmetic condition (but screen is perfect), and fully functioning. But I'd be out for the shipping both ways.  I'm just not sure how important touch id is but I know it's something I'd use all the time.	danniro	t1_det5jhs
t3_5yu3ua	t1_detaexj	1489278194	You have 6 months to file a PayPal claim against the phone.   Have you have the screen swapped?	OptionalCookie	t3_5yu3ua
t3_5yu3ua	t1_detavs8	1489278901	Well the seller is willing to let me return it but I'd have to pay return shipping.  No.... I don't know if I want to pay $100+ to do that though.	danniro	t1_detaexj
t3_5yu3ua	t1_detaxvm	1489278989	Are you serious?   It is $7 for a flat rate box in the USA. You don't have $7? I won't give you $7, but just pay it.	OptionalCookie	t1_detavs8
t3_5yu3ua	t1_detbiio	1489279856	If it's out of warranty, it's going to cost you at least 3 bills.	Bigchile123	t1_desxe7j
t3_5yu3ua	t1_detbs2f	1489280266	It's not just that. This phone I have is in near pristine condition aside from the touch id issue. The phone I'm looking at to replace it is $13 more, and in not as good of cosmetic condition - looks like the body is not in great condition. And I won't get back the shipping costs for sending this phone to me. So I'll end up maybe $25 out.	danniro	t1_detaxvm

t3_5yu3ua	t1_detcbra	1489281119	Lol now I'm feeling like the cost is probably worth it... Do you think the more banged up phone would be worth more in the end because it's fully functioning?	danniro	t1_detbuuq
t3_5yu3ua	t1_detdcyt	1489282732	I had a phone with a cracked screen: in a case, it was just fine :p  Idk, it really is up to you. I love Touch ID for the convenience, but a pin might be just fine.	OptionalCookie	t1_detcbra
t3_5yu3ua	t1_detei94	1489284501	Haha well, I've decided that it seems like a potentially $300 repair is not worth the slightly lower price of the initial device. I always have cases on my phones anyway. And the screen is fine which is the important thing.	danniro	t1_detdcyt
t3_5yu3ua	t1_dethaif	1489288870	The phone may look nice, but keep in mind that if the Touch ID sensor doesn't work, it almost certainly has a non-Apple display (if not also other parts). Maybe the previous owner just cracked the screen and didn't go to an Apple Store to have it fixed, but it could be all Frankenstein-y on the inside.	zerovulcan	t1_detbs2f
t3_5yu3ua	t1_detsbpe	1489314544	That would actually make sense... I was looking at the screen and I noticed a small circle (looked metal?) Near the home button under the screen and also a tiny loop inside the front camera lens. I don't remember those being present on my previous 6	danniro	t1_dethaif
t3_5yqgq4	t1_detsglz	1489315039	Same display? You mean same resolution display? You can read from sources on the net that they have improved the display. Can't really confirm myself though. Same battery? Wha? 1715mAh to 1960mAh... 14% increase from 6S. I think the battery is decent, almost twice my old 5S. No headphone jack? You can use the converter which works quite well! I game on iOS sometimes and I cannot notice any delay. Don't know about audio quality, though. I think most people won't notice. Also, the built in speakers are loud, really loud. Haptic feedback is quite cool IMHO. Don't forget they also improved/added water resistance! If you have an iPhone 6 or below, Touch ID v2 is also pretty cool!  The lack of upgrade to me was the camera. I can't even notice a lot of difference. But on night time, the much brighter flash can help a lot, though. And, I'm surprised even after the 1334x750 screen upgrade that happened 2+ years ago, some popular apps still stretch from their original made for 1136x640 assets! Quite ridiculous I'd say.  After all, IMO you should still go for the iPhone, especially if you can't stand Android.	pluush	t3_5yqgq4

The google apps work just like they do on android. I use Inbox, Drive, Google photos and Keep quite a bit. I pay for G Suite so I am sorta tied to Google's services.  Granted you will be missing out on swiping left to reach Google Now from the home screen but iOS has widgets that live there. So it is similar.    IME, apps are apps and for me they continue to work like they did on my N6.   The thing I miss the most so far is the direct access to the file system.	packet1	t3_5z09hk

t3_5z09hk	t1_deual4x	1489347904	I use Google Photos on iOS. It works great. Basically, when you take a photo, it goes into your iPhone's Camera Roll, and then Google Photos instantly uploads it.  I use it primarily as a way to backup and sync my photos across my devices. You have the option to delete your photos from your iPhone's camera roll with one tap if you want to get rid of them to free up space. I haven't needed to do this though because I have a decent sized iPhone for storage.  All of Google's other apps work nearly seamlessly. For example, if you're using Google Maps and tap on a link to a venue's website, Chrome opens automatically.	cocobandicoot	t1_deu95yz
t3_5z09hk	t1_deuashg	1489348187	Google Photos works well for me on iOS--the only major difference from Android is that you have to make sure you open the app occasionally to start the syncing process. Due to iOS restrictions on apps running in the background, it can't initiate a sync until you open the app.	Polarimetric	t1_deu95yz

t3_5z09hk	t1_deuoa81	1489366331	I am in the same camp but decided against moving permanently to iOS because of notifications.   Gmail is better on iOS than Android.  Google Photos is better on Android because it can backup pictures on background but in iOS you have to open the App. Google Calendar is same on both. Play Music is better on Android but manageable on iOS. Youtube is also same. Google Maps is also same on both platforms.  So Google services are good on iOS but a shout out to Microsoft who are great on both.  Tip :- Keep your contacts in Google account instead of iCloud.	xtremevicky	t3_5z09hk
t3_5z09hk	t1_deuoenu	1489366510	It seems like a negative at first but having more control of which apps are running ends up in amazing battery life. I've had my 6s plus off the charge for 5 hours now and I'm sitting at 85%.   EDIT: 3 hours later I'm at 75%	TimAus	t1_deuashg

t3_5z09hk	t1_deurg59	1489370872	I switch from Nexus 6 to iPhone 6S back when that was the new phone. I'm on iPhone 7 now. Everything has been great. I'm still very much in the Google eco system and have had zero issues. I switched because Android in general was becoming way less stable and becoming bloated. I switched from iPhone 3GS back in the day cause I wanted customization options. I switched back because I wanted a phone that just worked without a bunch of hassles. I had a fair amount of hardware issues on the Nexus 6.	ASREV	t3_5z09hk

t3_5z09hk	t1_deuszr9	1489373187	I also just switched from N6P to 7 Plus.  Battery life on 7+ is far superior. All of the google apps are good on IOS.  Official Gmail is ok. For some reason is works mostly the same, a few little quirks here and there.   The things I miss most from Android is the back button, drag and drop music and movies onto the device, and the stock google dialer is literally light years ahead of whatever apple is trying to achieve with this clunky disaster on IOS.  Also WTF Apple the IOS notifications are horrible.  Other IOS Pro's include the camera, camera speed, camera app.  iMessage is nice for friends who refused to get on WhatsApp. Almost all of the main stream apps are there and work fine.  Honestly Apple Hardware over anyone else.  If Android would have just gotten their shit together on the N6P battery I would have never left.  But they aren't and are basically abandoning it for Pixel.  Hey good for them, I just voted with my wallet though.  Another thought is if you have to use MS Services for work like Skype for Business and Outlook.  Those apps are WAY better on IOS.	BourbonZawa	t3_5z09hk
t3_5z09hk	t1_deut1hr	1489373259	In addition to this, you'll also have you delete your photos from Recently Deleted in Photos app after cleaning them through Google Photos. I usually sync my photos before taking a shower and that works out for me.	AkakiPeikrishvili	t1_deuashg

t3_5z09hk	t1_deutswh	1489374419	The integration of Google Apps on iOS is very lost.   It is literally an app, and there is no real interdependency of apps like there is on Android.   Like, I can use Google On Tap on a page on my Note5, and it will give me directions and even a GrubHub link to the restaurant I'm craving. And I touch the link and GrubHub *opens* and has me at the menu like ASAP.  Example of it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxy3A7Mf45Q  While the overall video is amusing, 2:32 is the mark you want to hit.  Google Now is straight up garbage on iOS. Doesn't work like it does on my Android with the whole spying on my behavior and what not. I can't really get train times from it like I used to on my Android.  Google Calendar works the same in iOS, but it has to fight with iOS calendar so often, I just said fuck it and used the built in one :|  Apple doesn't set default apps, so if you open directions from a friend, they will open in Apple Maps which has sent me to the wrong building multiple times. A quick search in Google Maps got me to the right place.	OptionalCookie	t3_5z09hk
t3_5yzn3u	t1_deuuaol	1489375189	I always ignored those cause of the price ($40?!), but I grabbed an open box one the other day for $5 and it hasn't left my phone yet. Love it	stopfive	t1_deuaapd
t3_5z09hk	t1_deuukky	1489375615	I just did that. Sold my XL, kept my normal Pixel for back up services, downloaded most of Google's apps. The keyboard is Google's, which is superior to Apple's, in my opinion. They've made the iPhone so much better, I'm satisfied with the switch. The Pixel was cool but felt boring and whatever. Great battery life and camera though but the apps on Android are still pretty clunky compared to iOS. Also, this phone makes me want to do more. It's pretty wicked and I like the lack of control that Apple has implemented on this one compared to the older generations, I can finally make it mine. Thanks to the removal of space grey, I finally got an all black iPhone with the JetBlack 7 Plus. Solid phone.   Edit: Google, Play Music, Translate, Sheets, DUO, Keep, Maps, Photos, Youtube, Drive, Chrome, Docs, and News. Just wish that I could replace Siri with Google Assistant because Siri is awful and I actually used assistant often.   Sad to say but I think the Google iOS apps are superior on iOS than Android. Before no but now wow. Especially because of the ability to remove the shit apps from Apple. Unfortunately Safari can't be removed and a few others but whatever. Also that the battery is nowhere near as optimized as the Pixel but whatever. I'm a fan again so Google lost customer on hardware. The 6P was perfect but the Pixel has had too many stupid issues.	iloveorcas	t3_5z09hk
t3_5z09hk	t1_deuvj33	1489377124	"Apple doesn't set default apps, so if you open directions from a friend, they will open in Apple Maps which has sent me to the wrong building multiple times. A quick search in Google Maps got me to the right place."  This. This is exactly what's concerning me with moving to iOS.. I'm on the verge of switching as well, but this would be an incredibly useful feature on iOS.. I don't want Apple to open links on Safari or maps on Apple maps...	yet-another-anon	t1_deutswh
t3_5z09hk	t1_deuvx6x	1489377772	I mostly use keep, google play music, gmail, and google maps.  GPM is by far the best service for music, at least for me. I replaced the stock music app with it. The only issue is is that you can't set the equalizer (which you can do on the stock music app). This usually is only an issue at the gym though.  Google maps works great on the phone, although any map link in other apps will link to the stock apple maps instead so beware.	LurkerPatrol	t3_5z09hk
t3_5z09hk	t1_deuvz2s	1489377856	I was going to a restaurant. Apple said it was at 21 x street.   It was actually at 41 x street. I'm trying to pull figure out where I am like an idiot.  Most apps default to safari as well, even though all my shit is in chrome.	OptionalCookie	t1_deuvj33
t3_5z2gbx	t1_deuwhfw	1489378715	I upgraded from the 6s Plus. I find that the 7 Plus battery has held up more than the 6s Plus I think due to the battery being slightly bigger in this model. I LOVE the dual cameras and the new Black color *better than Space Grey* tbh and I honestly don't really care much about the headphone jack thing. I have a pair of Solo3 and AirPods... so I don't really think often of this. I like the new haptics as they seem more precise and the home button just makes me feel it is more durable. Being Water resistant is a nice touch that I find is convenient and was worth the upgrade. Other than that, I am psyched to upgrade to a new iPhone 8, so long as this screen dimension stays and battery life becomes even better. :)	iDaru	t3_5z2gbx

t3_5z09hk	t1_deux7xj	1489380040	Losing Google now for Siri was the biggest downgrade. Google photos, inbox, music, chrome and maps work reasonably well. Drive is annoying just because iOS does not support a real file system but that isn't really Googles fault.   I went from android to iPhone 6 for 1.5 years and then moved to Pixel. I prefer the pixel because I use Google voice and Google now regularly. Those two apps are much better on Android.	arisreddit	t3_5z09hk

t3_5z09hk	t1_deuxt7p	1489381159	I use a bunch of Google services on iOS like Google App, Google Maps, Gmail, YouTube, Google Photos, Play Music and Gboard (google keyboard for iOS)  Everything works pretty good.  - you generally have to open Google Photos for syncing to occur.   - Gmail is nice and supports swiping to go back but the gesture is inconsistent which is frustrating.  - Using the Google App reminds me of what I dislike about Google - they are an ad company so they don't let you block ads.  Safari is great with 1blocker, but opening links in the Google App is painful with all the ads on some of the sites.  Unlike Android you don't have the option of hosts file adblock. - Similarly, you don't have the option for Xposed for Youtube AdAway so there's ads in the Youtube app too. - Maps is the same as it was on Android, except the compass is better for me because my Nexus 5X's was constantly bugged and had to be recalibrated - I don't use Play Music that much anymore since I subscribe to Spotify, but I remember it being at least as good as the Android version (which isn't saying much) - Gboard works great but suffers from some performance issues and occasional bugs like the keyboard not showing up because Gboard crashed.  I'm actually thinking of switching back to the stock keyboard because of the bugs and so Google doesn't collect my keystrokes as the only real feature I like is the swipe typing.	rydare	t3_5z09hk

t3_5z09hk	t1_dev203d	1489391073	A note that Gmail no longer supports the iOS Mail app for push delivery. You have to use the Gmail app (which was pretty awful, IMO, the last time I used it about a year ago. It might have gotten better since then) or a third party app like Email or Spark to get push Gmail.	rangoon03	t1_deuoa81
t3_5z2gbx	t1_dev28ya	1489391792	Meh, don't miss the headphone jack to be honest. Mostly used Bluetooth anyway and for the rare occasions where I do want aux I have that silly dongle. Also, as several others have pointed out the stocks seem to tell a story of success...	dwltz	t1_deus5is
t3_5z09hk	t1_dev2b5b	1489391977	No grouping of messages, which is crazy when you're part of big message groups and then have to wade through 50 separate oversized bubble notifications to see what other notifications are mixed in. Messages also disappear as soon as you unlock, which means you not only miss them half the time due to the speed of Touch ID, but they're simply gone the next time you unlock even though you haven't actioned any of these notifications. On Android, these stay until you clear them, which makes far more sense. So because you have these missed notifications, you have to access the notification center, and swipe right on the notification... which takes you to the widget screen, because consistency. Oh and also clearing notifications is a pain as it takes 2 actions - a swipe and a press. There are probably more issues than this too, as these are just the ones that annoy me. It's just an incredibly unpolished part of the OS, that feels very un-Apple like when the rest of the OS is quite good.	marvinos	t1_deuxk9v
t3_5z09hk	t1_dev2f5j	1489392317	Fair enough. I use the wake on lift feature so I don't have the Touch ID is too fast problem (I don't get why so many people don't like that feature, it was a great addition especially for fast camera access). Also I don't want my lock screen covered in a whole days worth of notifications I haven't explicitly cleared yet. If I need to go back to earlier notifications I'll use Notification Center.   I don't think I ever clear individual notifications unless I'm triggering an action on them like inline replies to message notifications. When I know I don't need them anymore I just force touch the X and clear them all at once.   Hasn't really ever bothered me. Grouping notifications does sound nice though.	The5thElephant	t1_dev2b5b

t3_5z2gbx	t1_dev4nfb	1489399500	A couple months ago I switched from the 6 to the 7 Plus. Even that upgrade wasn't super game-changing, other than screen size and the fact that I went from 16 GB to 128 GB. In your case I don't think there'd be much change in day-to-day use at all.  As for your question about the camera— the image quality of the 7 Plus is really similar to the 6S Plus. The only real noticeable difference is portrait mode and the telephoto lens, which are both really nice to have.	FeistyPotato	t3_5z2gbx
t3_5z2gbx	t1_dev4u0y	1489400091	I upgraded from the 6+ to the 7+ and find found the difference to be rather dramatic with the 7+ being a nearly perfect phone.  Solid as a rock and tight as a drum in all aspects...just reeks of high quality.  Absolutely the best iPhone yet.  I like the new home button and don't get the blowback regarding the haptic.  I use the camera a lot for video recording at night in a moving vehicle and it is the best low light/image stabilizing product I've used.  I quibble....although not a show stopper, I have run into the limitations of not having the 3.5mm headphone jack.  Credit card readers are harder to use when you have to connect to a dongle and the cost of various other dongle workarounds (i.e.   connect charger and headphone at the same time, etc.) will add up to a couple hundred bucks fairly quick.	boraerae	t3_5z2gbx

t3_5z2gbx	t1_dev59ia	1489401439	I made the upgrade.   My main reasons where:  1. louder peak sound from the internal speakers.  2. Better battery life (much much more than Apple conservatively states) 3. Water resistance  4. camera improvements 5. I was unusually flush with cash in September last year.	Portatort	t3_5z2gbx
t3_5z2gbx	t1_dev5ci2	1489401684	Hands down best feature of the iPhone 7 though.   Jet Black finish means I can use it case free without worrying I'll drop it.   It's easily lighter than the 6s too	Portatort	t3_5z2gbx
t3_5z2gbx	t1_dev61f7	1489403645	Yes.  I don't have to worry about ruining the phone if I get caught in a downpour, (and I don't need a huge brick case for this reassurance), and the camera is worth it for me just by itself.. I wouldn't wear a smart watch that gets ruined if I accidentally submerge it, but I was carrying a phone that isn't strapped to my wrist. For me it's worth it.    I already have some decent bluetooth headphones for when I'm out and about, and I have QC35's for home.  For the car, I just put my little lightning jack audio adapter in the car and now I can listen to my favorite songs in the car. My car doesn't have bluetooth.   Edit : I wanted to add that if you can't buy a 7 plus and an 8 if it's awesome, you can probably wait until September. But for me, the camera and waterproof was well worth it.

t3_5z09hk	t1_dev7gq7	1489407183	I'm not surprised. With my Nexus 5 there were many times that updates would just kill battery life and take a long time for a fix. I've had to do a clean install after one major update.  People complain about updates taking too long on other Android phones through the carrier but you don't run into these types of issues. Being a nexus user felt like being a beta tester which is probably the point of the nexus program.	BababooeyHTJ	t3_5z09hk

t3_5z2gbx	t1_dev7u3v	1489408007	It was worthwhile for me. My favorite features are the camera, the improved water resistance, battery life, &amp; most important to me is having 256GB of storage.

t3_5z2gbx	t1_dev8iwv	1489409399	&gt; The S8, G6, Xperia XZ, OnePlus (4?  Do people seriously think these companies started manufacturing their phones in September?   The S8 (per reports) started development even before the S7 was released. Samsung never knew Apple will not include the jack.   Same applies to LG, HTC, and other companies when they release their flagship devices.   In the case of the HTC Ultra, there is no way they developed that phone in just two months. So it took it from Motorola, who released their "no-jack" phone on July	exjr_	t1_dev76su
t3_5z2gbx	t1_dev90rk	1489410299	No, multiple means 2 or more.

t3_5z2gbx	t1_devad23	1489412525	[Plenty of rumours](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-8/), but there won't be any official announcement until the day they formally introduce the product. If they stick to the established schedule, that should be some time in September. There will most likely also be new iOS and macOS versions around the same time. These are usually revealed much earlier than the new hardware, namely at Apple's developers' conference (WWDC) in early June and may go into into a public beta a few weeks or months later, but the final versions should come out around the same time as the new iPhones.   iPads, iMacs and MacBooks are all rumoured to receive upgrades earlier than that, and quite a few people are hoping for new pro machines at WWDC, but these devices are all on more irregular release cycles than the iPhone, so it's hard to say for sure. Although, from what I've heard there are solid indicators for an iPad event before the end of April, possibly even with an iMac refresh thrown in.	simplequark	t1_dev1zpt
t3_5z2gbx	t1_devahew	1489412714	I upgraded from the 6S+ to 7+ and really only notice two big differences, the battery is subjectively better and the portrait mode is incredible.  I've never once wished I had the headphone jack.  I have bluetooth audio in my car and a few pairs of bluetooth headphones that work well, but even if I didn't, they give you an adapter for regular headphones and the improved battery life on the phone makes it so that I can't imagine needing to charge it while using headphones.  It's really a non-issue for me, but your experience may vary.  My recommendation would be to just wait for the next one at this point.	JonathanDWeaver	t3_5z2gbx

t3_5z2gbx	t1_devat20	1489413207	I don't think they gambled on that. I don't think they really care. They've seen fantastic sales of the iPhone 7 so far, so it's not like they need the competition to follow suit in order to get people to buy their phone. They're banking on the features they've been able to add being worth it to customers, and while it may not seem like that to many right now, I think the time they've spent polishing 3D Touch/Taptic on the iPhone 7, plus the time spent getting developers to think about how to integrate it, is going to pay off big time when they move to an edge-to-edge, buttonless display. That *is* where the whole industry is heading right now, and they're going to have far and away the most usable version of it because of the ability to put stuff on the screen that feels like a button and only is triggered with pressure.	dccorona	t1_dev76su
t3_5z2gbx	t1_devayuw	1489413449	I upgraded and don't see any reason why I should have made the effort. Kinda wish I still had my 6S Plus. Audio jack and real mechanical home button which I like way better than the current one.	mxk31	t3_5z2gbx
t3_5z2gbx	t1_devb3yw	1489413663	I had an iPhone 7+ since it came out, and just switched back to the 6s+ a few weeks ago, because I needed an unlocked phone while traveling. After going back to it, I am actually amazed at how much I use the headphone jack when it is available. With the 7, I carry an extra pair of earphones in my pocket whenever I go out, and use the lightening earphones at home for pretty much everything. It's not really that inconvenient honestly. I have almost never left either my Apple earphones or a dongle adapter at home, so I never ran into problems of not being able to use the phone outside. But the biggest thing I noticed after using the 6s+ again is that I actually *do* use the headphone jack more without Apple earphones than I realized. I have a really good pair of Bowers and Wilkins that have almost always been attached to my stationary Mac since I moved to the new iPhone, but I find myself taking those out now if I am near them and using them with the 6s+. I find that without the headphone jack, I almost always use just the Apple earphones because they are really conviennent, and using other headphones just seems like a lot of work (to go find the dongle if it's in the other room, or turning on Bluetooth), that I just don't bother with them enough to use them at all. It's not as much of a problem as it is a daily use-scenario.	iamseiko	t3_5z2gbx
t3_5z2gbx	t1_devbnqi	1489414470	This.  I used the camera a little more.  and I like having a black phone with 256gb, however do I really notice any difference with use? Barely to negligible.	petrusk	t1_dev0dqo

t3_5z4vfg	t1_devgzsc	1489421164	I agree it would be nice to have a single option to click - but you CAN do this if you want.  Go to "Settings -&gt; Do Not Disturb".  From here, you can tell it you don't want to be bothered, but you can add exceptions.  For example, you can accept all calls from your contacts, or allow a certain group (e.g. "Friends and Family" if you're at home, "All Clients" if you're at work, etc.).  I do the opposite of what everyone is suggesting!  I open up my list to "everyone" when I'm at work because I don't know if I'm going to get calls from clients, vendors, or else.  But when I get home, those people go directly to voice mail, with the exception of a few employees who are on my "emergency list".  So at home, I limit who I'm willing to accept calls from (of course, they all go to voice mail so I have the option to listening to their plight and responding if I care to), but at work, I open it up to the entire public.  Anyway - look into the "Do Not Disturb" settings - there are some cool options there, though not exactly what you're asking for.	moronictransgression	t3_5z4vfg

How about you put the dongle on the headphones or cord and leave it there?  &gt; Please do tell, what solution would fix the issue of the charging and the earbud taking up the same port?  Have you heard of bluetooth? There are cheap bluetooth adapters all over amazon.   &gt;I do not use bluetooth headphones, nor will I ever.  Haha, gotcha. So you've taken the best solution off the table for no reason? Makes sense.   &gt;The fact that I can't even charge my phone and listen to music at this same time is laughably stupid.  You can, you just refuse to find a solution.  Overall... if you refuse to use bluetooth headphones, adapters, and refuse to put the adapter on the headphones and leave them there... why did you buy the fucking phone?  You either thought that you would be able to magically solve the problem despite taking all of the solutions off the table. (STUPID)  Or... you bought the phone knowing you wouldn't be able to solve the problem because you took all of the solutions off the table. (STUPID)  &gt;Apple fucked up hard, and sales numbers don't lie.  Uh, you mean their most popular phone ever? Multiple people already corrected your claim.   What are you smoking?   &gt;you're seriously just a dumb, conceited person.  The guy who bought a phone without a headphone port that refuses to use bluetooth or manage an adapter is calling someone else dumb?  Now THAT'S funny! Thanks for the laugh:)	thisiswhatyouget	t1_devyf93

t3_5z2gbx	t1_devzsmt	1489441947	No. Other than the stronger vibration motor, you can't tell that there's a difference.   ... except for when you try to plug headphones in.	007meow	t3_5z2gbx
t3_5z2gbx	t1_devzuro	1489442017	&gt; Because that is absolutely ridiculous, and looks like some tacky ghetto shit.  So why did you buy the phone, moron? You knew there would be no options available to you to solve the problem, yet you still bought it.  Idiot buys phone with issue he knows he can't solve. Complains.   &gt;Bluetooth speakers have absolutely terrible audio quality  Only cheap ones.   &gt;Enjoy your dongle(s), (Don't worry, you WILL lose them)  I've had the phone since launch. I have bluetooth headphones, and I have a pair of cheap skullcandy's I use. The dongle has been on the skullcandy's since day one. Haven't lost it.   &gt;A 3% increase does not make up for a 30% loss in sales.  In the quarter you are looking at, Apple sold 78 million iPhones.  The most iPhones it had ever sold in a quarter.   You just made it oh so obvious why you would buy a phone with an issue that has no way of working for you (you know, because you are too stupid to leave the dongle on the headphones).  You are a moron. Case closed.	thisiswhatyouget	t1_devyy55
t3_5z2gbx	t1_dew0ftx	1489442691	&gt; I naively trusted in Apple to provide a user experience that would make up for the lack of the aux port and they failed miserably.  So, just to reiterate, you thought there would be a magical solution that nobody ever could have thought of, and that wasn't available when you bought the phone.  Yep. STUPID.  &gt;not able to listen to music because you don't have your apple branded adaptor for your apple branded phones and your apple branded headphones  Apple gives you lightning headphones in the box.  You lost them. Like you lost multiple adapters.  I'm convinced. You are an idiot that blames their idiocy on everyone else.   You are literally saying you thought Apple had some other solution, despite the fact that it was very clear what your options would be before buying.	thisiswhatyouget	t1_dew09ve
t3_5z4vfg	t1_dew0l50	1489442869	No, I don't want themes. I want to trust Apple to get it right, ergonomically and aesthetically. The whole point of using Apple stuff is that you don't get bamboozled by 1000 different config options.	gewgwegweegw	t3_5z4vfg

t3_5z4vfg	t1_dew189i	1489443631	The exceptions would be usefull if they could be app based (did an feedback suggestion for that). I'm on call so I need my work email to wake me up, but that means I can't put my phone in DND mode so all night my phone is at max volume with notifications tunred on (unless I manually go through and start silencing every other app 1 by 1 every day).	geoken	t1_devgzsc

t3_5z4vfg	t1_dewga3p	1489462916	This is for so others can view your calendar availability without seeing your actual scheduled items. It's essential for business uses. You can create a meeting and see other people's availability (busy or available) to determine the best time when everyone can meet. People may have things scheduled in their calendar but are actually available to meet at that time.  It wouldn't be practical to use this flag for a DND function (at least not on its own).

t3_5z4vfg	t1_dewhb4e	1489464461	I don't think so. My Lineage 14.1 has a "System Profiles" menu in the settings. Triggers are WiFi, Bluetooth and NFC (I can also manually trigger them), and it can switch the status of GPS, WiFi, Notification sounds, volume, ambient display and almost everything else. Shouldn't be that hard to automate that with Tasker using geofences and stuff.  Sent from my Samsung Galaxy S5	whitereader	t1_devpxo8

t3_5z2gbx	t1_dewjq0m	1489468564	New camera was a big plus for me. Makes getting good pictures of my daughter easier. Also, I think it got more RAM this time around? I notice apps don't refresh during "multitasking" as much. Big Imgur albums don't crash my phone anymore.	shiznifterflifen	t3_5z2gbx
t3_5z2gbx	t1_dewkm34	1489470373	I'm curious about if the extra ram on the 7 plus makes any difference.   I heard 10.1 helped ram management a bit?   6s plus is OK but still nothing can compare with the large iPad pro which basically never closes apps lol.	chickdigger802	t3_5z2gbx

t3_5zdqdn	t1_dex9syq	1489514949	I am most likely going to go smaller and get the iPhone 7 down from my 7 Plus and it's a given that I will get the battery case. I used it on my 6S and it's probably one of the top 5 products Apple has produced in the last 18 months.	mxk31	t3_5zdqdn
t3_5zdqdn	t1_dexaqru	1489515990	Why would u go from the plus to the normal one ? Just curious	BlueFrozenSoul	t1_dex9syq
t3_5zdqdn	t1_dexavbj	1489516129	The way I use my phone on the go makes the size a clusterfuck for me. I thought I would use the camera way more and it turns out it didn't even make a difference for me. I'm happy as long as I have OIS for video which the 6S didn't have but the 7 does.	mxk31	t1_dexaqru
t3_5z4vfg	t1_dexeh6m	1489520155	I think I just found an app that will nearly do that. It has no reviews and was just released and isnt free, so I haven't actually tested it   AutoSilence by Niv Gutherz https://appsto.re/us/UPoRhb.i	Tyrannosaurus-WRX	t1_devdr1r
t3_5zdqdn	t1_dexfxeo	1489521791	To see the full usage we need a screenshot taken at 0% otherwise I half to do a lot of math, and I was told there would be no math.	Mixedbysaint	t3_5zdqdn
t3_5z4vfg	t1_dexi0bg	1489524109	I tried the full auto silent app. It requires GPS even if you don't do anything with location based silencing, and it drains your battery instantly. Trashed it.	TopographicOceans	t1_dexeh6m
t3_5zf27e	t3_5zf27e	1489526803	Most of my Instagram notifications show up like this on my iPhone 4 (7.1.2). Instagram is the only app with this problem and it only occurs some of the time, how do I fix it?	pete7201	-1
t3_5zdqdn	t1_dexl7l6	1489527682	Never understood why they never made one for the Plus. It would turn the Plus into a beast.	MRizkBV	t3_5zdqdn
t3_5zdqdn	t1_dexmnhd	1489529360	I'm assuming that the market for people dissatisfied with the already awesome 7+ battery life is too niche to be worth it.	mrm3x1can	t1_dexl7l6
t3_5z2gbx	t1_dexrqrz	1489535740	Nope, had it, sold it, back on my 6S+. Feels identical in speed, camera quality and battery life. The dual camera seemed like a gimmick to me. The 2x zoom wasn't really enough to be impressive. Now I have my headphone jack back, couldn't be happier. Yes I know I'm going to have to accept no headphone jack for the iPhones going forward.	Dinkdinkdata	t3_5z2gbx
t3_5zfzbl	t3_5zfzbl	1489536156	Anyone experiencing more battery drain over last few days? 7+	Mycoxadril	-1
t3_5zf27e	t1_dextd15	1489537763	Most likely it's because Instagram changed the way their notifications are delivered, and iOS 7 can't interpret them correctly.    Starting in iOS 8 or 9, the maximum size of an Apple push notification payload increased to 4 KB.  Instagram is probably taking advantage of that, but your phone can't.	eaglebtc	t3_5zf27e
t3_5zf27e	t1_dextrrl	1489538267	If I remember right, iOS 3 - iOS 7 max at 256 bytes (1 and 2 don't support push), iOS 8 is between 256 and 4 kb, and 9/10 are 4 kb   Still interesting how some of the notifications work but not others	pete7201	t1_dextd15
t3_5zf27e	t1_dextswm	1489538305	Yeah, thanks.  I wasn't sure if the limit was 256 or 2048 on that platform.  But I suspect that is exactly what is happening here.	eaglebtc	t1_dextrrl
t3_5zf27e	t1_dextysk	1489538503	Probably.  take a look at [these](http://imgur.com/a/WWQds) notifications. Some of them from ig work fine and some ^longer ones from discord work find as well	pete7201	t1_dextswm
t3_5zdqdn	t1_dexv1on	1489539838	I got mine when it first came out the 6. Lol the battery can only charge mine back up to around 80% now from 0%.	murtadi007	t3_5zdqdn
t3_5zf27e	t1_dexw6uh	1489541206	OP, didn't you say that this is an iPhone 4 running on IOS 7?	eaglebtc	t1_dexu456
t3_5zf27e	t1_dexwaj9	1489541332	Yeah, I was just curious what the limit in iOS 8 was	pete7201	t1_dexw6uh
t3_5zf27e	t1_dexwapg	1489541338	The payload for the IG notifications probably contains additional diagnostic data that only the developers would see.  The application URL to the specific post must be in there as well.  The notification text that you see on the homescreen is very likely the last chunk of data in the payload.  If it goes over your device limit, it just gets truncated.    I suspect they left some debug stuff turned on, it went to production, and they forgot to do regression testing.	eaglebtc	t1_dextysk
t3_5zf27e	t1_dexwpiq	1489541831	They probably assumed everyone who would be using social media has updated to iOS 10 on their new phone so they don't test their app on iOS 7  The newest version of Instagram requires iOS 8, so they probably don't care about the older iOS 6/7 versions	pete7201	t1_dexwapg
t3_5zf27e	t1_dexx2wa	1489542270	But they worried so goddamn much about their new (horrible) logo.   They could have gone with a "flat effect" rainbow camera instead of the old skeuomorphic design, and it would have had the same impact.	eaglebtc	t1_dexwpiq
t3_5zf27e	t1_dexxjro	1489542823	Idk when I first got into IG they used the new logo, I've only seen the old &lt;iOS 6 style logo printed out on paper. I've used iOS 4, 5, 6, and 7 and like the newer ios design a lot more	pete7201	t1_dexx2wa
t3_5zdqdn	t1_dexyexx	1489543893	I absolutely love mine. I stopped using it as a full time case due to the extra thickness and weight that's added to the phone but I love the fact that I can just slap it on when I know I'm going to be doing some extremely battery heavy things or don't have time to charge my phone.	butzsecs	t3_5zdqdn
t3_5zdqdn	t1_dey0j46	1489546696	I have this for the 6s. Amazing battery life and I actually like the heavier feel of the case and the material. I keep mine on permanently.	gym_jams	t3_5zdqdn
t3_5zdqdn	t1_dey0sgg	1489547047	I'm definitely going to get the smaller variant of the next phone. iPhone 7 Plus is great, but the battery can't take my usage (and, to be honest, I find the screen far to big).	wakaawak	t3_5zdqdn
t3_5zfzbl	t1_dey0v1t	1489547149	Hmm... I noticed a similar situation today. I got home to 7% for the first time since I've owned my phone back in September, and I usually get home with around 60%.  I used the phone just as much as I usually do. Not sure why there was a sudden drain today.   I'll check it out tomorrow again. I hope it's not a 6 month bug that's similar to the 1 year bug that appeared with the launch 6s'...	zeroShifter	t3_5zfzbl
t3_5zfzbl	t1_dey1okq	1489548294	Same here with my 6 and my wife's 6S. Past couple of days just seems to be draining like crazy even after killing all running apps and full reboot. Could be a "buy a new phone" bug.	Sickman-D	t3_5zfzbl
t3_5zdqdn	t1_dey3e0c	1489550835	My 7 Plus barely makes it through the day now that I'm using snapchat more (thanks, friends, for being active snapchat users lol...) I'd really appreciate some kind of boost.  Usually dead in about 5 hours of use. It's terrible. I hate snapchats app so much, but I love the service.	uncertain-ithink	t1_dexmnhd
t3_5zfzbl	t1_dey9iqx	1489563525	I've noticed the drain ever since updating to 10.2.1, and I just got my 7plus less than a month ago. I was really impressed with the battery life over my S6 when I initially got it, but less so right now.	dgforce	t3_5zfzbl
t3_5zfzbl	t1_deyb8vd	1489568789	Yep I thought my battery drained pretty quickly too, was below 20% when I got home at 4pm and that was without any real heavy usage. I'm on a 7 plus.	BertieBongo	t3_5zfzbl
t3_5zdqdn	t1_deybjfu	1489569732	Barely makes a difference with Snapchat battery consumption, all it does is make it lag	plonkyy	t1_dey7kai
t3_5zfzbl	t1_deycfm5	1489572583	Can confirm, same thing happens to me. It is not worrysome yet, but not worrying about battery too much is the exact reason why i made the switch from Android to my iPhone7+ in the first place...	meeeega	t3_5zfzbl
t3_5zf27e	t1_deycp21	1489573392	Do you have an older Instagram version on your iTunes folder on your laptop to test if notifications are fine? I doubt Instagram would ever fix this, sadly	itsmegeorge	t3_5zf27e
t3_5zfzbl	t1_deyey98	1489579310	Same issue here . 6S Plus, under normal usage I'd get home at 5/6pm with 50/60%. Only been taken off the charge at 7am and yesterday and today at 11am I had 40%. Like mentioned below had not changed any settings apart from updated apps as normal. Unsure if its a specific app draining the battery or if its an actual iPhone/iOS issue. It sucks!!!!	laverty660	t3_5zfzbl

t3_5zdqdn	t1_deyhwjj	1489584586	And even without LPM it still lags my ENTIRE PHONE, like horribly. It's the only app that will make my phone totally skip the animation when you leave the app, just like an old iPad mini 2 or iPad Air or something.  Often doing anything in the app or leaving the app is like a 10FPS animation. Swiping up control center or pulling down Notification Center is like this as well. And banners. And addressing/dismissing them. And tapping spotlight search button in Notification Center. Going in and out of the app switcher. Literally anything. The entire phone is a total dog, and is hot, and terrible when using snapchat.	uncertain-ithink	t1_deybjfu

t3_5zluhj	t1_dezbh39	1489617926	My girlfriend used to have an iPhone 6 and I'd sometimes write messages, check notifications etc while she drives when she asked. I have a 6s Plus and could not get used to not having 3D Touch. Interacting with notifications, the track pad on the keyboard, highlighting text or using shortcuts. It just felt so alien to me because I'm so used to having it and its crept into my daily life as the norm.	examinati0n	t3_5zluhj

When I'm sorting something out on my sisters SE, I get frustrated knowing I can't move the cursor on the keyboard 👎🏽.   I just really wish Apple had a short mandatory tutorial when setting up a new iPhone so more people knew of its features, there's still a lot of people with 6s' and 7s that have no idea of the versitality of 3D Touch.

The texture on the sides and back are extremely grippy as well as maintaining a thin profile.   Also, what level of protection are you looking for for your phone?	Fender6969	t3_5znb5z
t3_5znb5z	t1_dezjem9	1489627626	I've had a spigen neo hybrid on my iPhone 6 for the last 2.5 years so something similar. I'm probably gonna get a neo hybrid for the 7 plus but I want another case with a similar level of protection, cause I like to switch up my cases often	ayysizzle	t1_dezj0x2
t3_5znb5z	t1_dezk219	1489628417	If that's the level of protection that you are looking for, you may find the case I have recommended in your favor. Regardless, best of luck in your search!	Fender6969	t1_dezjem9
t3_5znb5z	t1_dezk74b	1489628594	I have two:   1) Apple Leather case.   Personally, if you want a case that will protect your phone and also stay relatively thin, the best choice is the Apple Leather case. It's such a great case. I had one on my iPhone 6 and loved it and they made it even better for the iPhone 7. I've dropped my phone countless times, from many different heights, on many different surfaces, and never had an issue. Great all around functionality and protection.   2) Elago Origin thin case https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01JRJ93CK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_qWEYyb5JMGJR2  After using a coworkers completely naked phone, I felt the need to start using something very thin. The naked iPhone is such a pleasure to hold, and this Elago case barely adds any bulk. Yes, it only protects from scratches and if the phone is dropped I'm pretty fucked, but it feels so good to use it. No protection is always infinitely better feeling than using protection.   Also, I have a friend who owns a Cadaube Sheeth case and swears by it.    Case I don't like: Apple Silicone case. Buttons are hard to press, and is such a pain in the ass to take out of your jeans pocket.	iMau5	t3_5znb5z

t3_5znb5z	t1_dezn9xa	1489632477	As someone who reviews cases for a living, my top 3 daily drivers:  1.

Speck Presidio Grip - The added rubber grip lines are a preventative measure to drop protection rather than reactive 3.

t3_5zvo9h	t1_df2363i	1489769572	I wish they'd called it Force Touch rather than 3D Touch. Force makes more sense, and the Mac trackpads seem to be able to detect multiple levels of pressure anyway.	aldrinjtauro	t3_5zvo9h
t3_5zvo9h	t1_df237y4	1489769630	I love 3D touch! I wish more apps implemented it. I also wish I had it on my iPad Pro.	rdldr1	t1_df1fwag
t3_5zvo9h	t1_df23prj	1489770179	I think most people who bought the iPhone 6S or the iPhone 7 didn't even know about it. Apple doesn't really provide a tutorial on phone use or anything like that. I remember talking to a stylist who was wondering why she would sometimes get a popup menu when pressing the icons on the home screen. I explained the 3D Touch features to her and she was amazed she hadn't heard of it.	crispix24	t3_5zvo9h
t3_5zvo9h	t1_df23qcj	1489770198	I think that is a major over-statement. It can be useful, but it's use is determined by the specific apps and the developers who make them. It's not a system wide tool that can be used everywhere and serves multiple useful functions. In most cases it's a gimmick, in the best cases it saves a few seconds to peek into content or quickly switch apps. It's not nearly as useful as right-clicking.	thebuggalo	t1_df21l3s

t3_5zvo9h	t1_df26d3k	1489773089	I use it most days. Usually for replying to text notifications.   I wish they would add functionality to it in reference to the Control Center. I like being able to press on the flashlight to change brightness, but I'd love that option on the Bluetooth and Wifi toggles also.

t3_5zvo9h	t1_df27gyp	1489774293	Maybe people (like me) who use it very often are in the minority?   Personally, I feel like you're limiting yourself if you're not using 3D Touch regularly. Apps switching alone is amazing.	CA_dot	t3_5zvo9h

t3_5zza1g	t1_df28lah	1489775499	Well, obviously the song needs to download if you want to listen to it and it's not on your phone. I'm assuming you're on a wifi network when this happens. Do you have [Wi-fi Assist](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205296) on?	pheen	t3_5zza1g
t3_5zza1g	t1_df28zbf	1489775917	I think what OP means is that even though you have music data disabled, it will connect over cellular so that it can play songs in your library, but haven't been downloaded. Since data is disabled, it should not attempt to download and play those songs.   At least that's what happened to me. My solution was to stop using Apple Music.	snailshoe	t1_df28lah
t3_5zza1g	t1_df290ny	1489775958	I have wifi off.  My angle is that if I turn off my Apple Music data that it should not allow you to listen to songs that are not downloaded. But that is not the case. Curious if it's a bug	calguyy	t3_5zza1g
t3_5zza1g	t1_df295o4	1489776113	I can play songs in my Apple Music library so long as my cellular data remains on(excluding Music data). It's only when I turn airplane mode on that I can only play music downloaded on my phone.	calguyy	t3_5zza1g
t3_5zza1g	t1_df29idw	1489776505	Are you turning it off under Settings &gt; Cellular or Settings &gt; Music &gt; Cellular Data? Maybe it needs to be off in both?	pheen	t1_df290ny
t3_5zza1g	t1_df2atpe	1489777961	Yes, And your solution seems like the only current way to not burn through data that wasn't supposed to be used in the first place.  And also playing music from "downloaded only" library is besides the point. (Before anyone brings that up)	calguyy	t1_df28zbf
t3_5zvo9h	t1_df2awvz	1489778063	This is the reason so many don't use it, and at first it is not natural to do it. It either feels like a long press or jamming your thumb through the glass. It's odd.	nnjb52	t1_df23prj

t3_5zvo9h	t1_df2cm8i	1489779992	Same with a lot of my friends. If they want it to be utilized more, they should make the 3D Touch adjustment setting pop up during set up, similar to how the New Home Button setup is on the iPhone 7/7+.	rsmseries	t1_df1v96e

t3_5zza1g	t1_df2cue6	1489780251	When I got throttled by AT&amp;T last month I was capped at 128kbps. That is not enough to stream music, subsequently this situation above still occurred. I was able to hear songs that weren't downloaded quite well. No pausing or buffering.	calguyy	t1_df28zbf
t3_5zvo9h	t1_df2dqo2	1489781278	I definitely didn't use it for some time, but in the last 6 months or so have really started putting it to use. As more apps began implementing it, I find that it's easier to integrate into my daily workflow.	Wdc331	t3_5zvo9h
t3_5zvo9h	t1_df2dsl2	1489781339	You need to remember that us, redditors are techies that read on all the latest updates for iOS. To the regular consumer they will hardly ever know about 3D Touch or care to bother using it.	sandeepsb	t3_5zvo9h

t3_5zza1g	t1_df2qwz7	1489798947	Worked seamlessly. As if it wasn't caped. I don't see how a song from Apple Music can be cached locally— could be from a lack of knowledge lol.	calguyy	t1_df2q5zq

t3_602ep1	t1_df31xc7	1489818906	OP is asking why, when you record video on your iPhone, if you're holding your iPhone vertically, why can't the video still record horizontally.  I believe the answer would be that the camera lens is rectangle shaped. That would be my guess anyway.  The only way you could get around this would be if the lens were circular, so that regardless of how you held the camera, the video would fill the screen. The downside would be that any of the footage outside of the frame would have to be cut off or hidden. Unless you want to watch circular videos.  (Snapchat is actually doing that with their camera-enabled Spectacles sunglasses. Circular video.)	cocobandicoot	t1_df30x03
t3_602ep1	t1_df32rqf	1489821274	Because this is how the sensor looks (the red rectangle)  http://imgur.com/EXDeLkP  It's attached like the phones shape (display).  It's logical if you look at your horizontal phone that you shoot horizontal photos, same on landscape.	sloppyFarts	t3_602ep1

t3_5zvo9h	t1_df35gei	1489830236	That's to clear all the notifications for that particular app, right?  If you 3D Touch one of those X buttons, it changes to "Clear All Notifications" (clears every notification from every app).  [Like this.](http://i.imgur.com/8TsaRRw.jpg)  It's a small convenience, but I think it's one of the few things that can only be done with 3D Touch.	Aldarro	t1_df35212
t3_5zvo9h	t1_df35l01	1489830681	Huh. I guess that added that in an update at some point.  I had an SE a while ago on iOS 10 and I distinctly remember there being no clear all option.	Aldarro	t1_df35gw5

t3_602ep1	t1_df3dg02	1489849573	Thanks, that answers my question. I wonder if they could make a square sensor so you can decide to shoot landscape without having to turn the phone. It's just awkward to turn the phone sideways.	DanceO	t1_df32rqf

t3_608v3m	t1_df4ewk3	1489905645	Apple is not going to release a new SE this year. I mean it is better to get 64gb, but since you are saying that 64gb is out of your budget, it is better to go with 16gb or you can wait until sept to checkout the new IPhones.	Naturepower	t3_608v3m
t3_608v3m	t1_df4f0or	1489905942	I know there won't be a new SE this year. But I wonder if Apple will bump the storages to 32GB and 128GB, like the rumors suggest. If a 32GB variant is coming for sure, I can hold on my purchase.	shah1012	t1_df4ewk3
t3_608v3m	t1_df4f66b	1489906343	Well, JD.com from the Chinese amazon-like market place is selling $330 for the 64g model.   I have no idea how the shipment would work out, but if yoy can get it, that would be within your budget.	naeads	t3_608v3m
t3_608v3m	t1_df4f9c0	1489906577	Importing mobile devices from other countries will attract a lot of taxes in India. It may end up costlier than buying a 64GB one locally. :(	shah1012	t1_df4f66b
t3_608v3m	t1_df4g4jj	1489909043	If you've waited this long, wait a bit more. Once apple releases new phones, the prices of the present ones will go down anyway. Then you have the option of choosing from 16GB SE at a lower price than present and a 32 GB SE (if) they release it.   Any which way, you will get the 16GB SE at a lower price point.   I'd say wait.	PizzaSatan	t3_608v3m
t3_608v3m	t1_df4gehk	1489909884	I guess the sale is to clear the stocks before the storage bump, if it happens.

t3_60bpw9	t1_df55zwk	1489956359	Once at 100% the iPhone goes on to "trickle charge"; which is when the iPhone will stop taking power until it's about to hit 99% battery, then it'll charge it for a moment again and stop when at 100% and keep that cycle going.  You should let your battery run all the way down every once in a while, but it doesn't do any harm to leave it plugged in all day.	Lambinater	t3_60bpw9
t3_60bpw9	t1_df57y1l	1489958459	The reason I'm asking is I want to use my uNu battery case like this. I want to have the phone at 100% and leave the case on until the case dies, then use the phone battery.	Zebulon1993	t3_60bpw9

t3_60clqa	t1_df5ozb2	1489979147	Depending on if you have insurance, how expensive it is for them to fix it, and how comfortable you are, you could just buy the screen replacement digitizer combo with tools for like $145 on eBay and fix it yourself. Not sure how much it differs from my iPhone 6P but I've opened up and fixed stuff in there so many times now. The battery is about the only hard thing to replace bc of the adhesive.	jojomexi	t3_60clqa
t3_608lh6	t1_df5pnby	1489980053	I'm using something called SlenderCase that I found on Amazon for like seven bucks.

t3_60clqa	t1_df5qrug	1489981716	Should be the same price as a normal screen repair. The outer cover glass is laminated (glued) directly to the LCD so when apple replaces the front glass on your phone they are actually replacing the the digitizer, front glass, LCD and possibly the Touch ID sensor (pretty sure they remove and transfer it, but not sure). It all comes as one piece.	1arebeast2	t3_60clqa

t3_60clqa	t1_df5sdzq	1489984386	To answer your question. Yes. Almost any repair would fix this problem with a simple "screen replacement." Usually companies opt for an assembly. Which is glass digitizer and LCD. Where some offer a complete assembly which is glass digitizer LCD home-button ear speaker. Pretty much a plug and play part. If your feeling like you can do it yourself try a complete assembly.   Otherwise yes. Insurance or apple.	SuperIllVillain	t3_60clqa

t3_60clqa	t1_df5t4ms	1489985764	Since it obviously boots and appears to otherwise function ok, and the outer frame of the phone seems ok, then I'd say yeah it would appear a screen replacement would fix the situation.	elislider	t3_60clqa

t3_60clqa	t1_df5vnkf	1489991310	The plug and play option worked for earlier iPhone's better than it does now. Now you will lose the finger print recognition functionality if you swap out your home button as they are unique to each individual iPhone.	ApplesofGold1869	t1_df5sdzq
t3_60clqa	t1_df5w282	1489992372	I had a similar situation... a Pyrex bowl landed on my iPhone screen. It was classified as out of warranty due to the lack of AppleCare plus, and charged me $150 for a complete screen replacement.   I do encourage you to not have a third party repair, unless they too have calibration equipment like what Apple has within their stores. Be aware that it can be a two hour process.  I repair iPhone screens myself, and am pretty good at it, but it's the calibration Apple has that makes those screens last a good while compared to my quick repairs.  Just checked: the calibration is also for the setup of the new home button as each Touch ID sensor is unique to the iPhone.... aka doing it yourself risks the loss of Touch ID.	HansChr15	t1_df5a2ta
t3_60clqa	t1_df5w643	1489992663	$145 for all that and risk of damaging the phone yourself? An official apple repair is just $15 more (tax included). I'm knowledgeable about repairs since I do them myself, but there really is no point in doing it yourself, unless you want that satisfaction that you did a thing.	HansChr15	t1_df5ozb2
t3_60bpw9	t1_df5wgxs	1489993480	In my engineering class, I learned that smartphones would go through trickle charge and at the same time, drawing power directly from the power source instead of the battery...   Gotta love tech advancements.	HansChr15	t3_60bpw9

t3_60drud	t1_df5wx80	1489994741	That's why you can't unlock it.  I've unlocked numerous phones I bought used, but I'd added them all to my account.

But, since the phone is currently active on your H2O account this might not work. You may have to try using a different phone on your account while you wait for them to unlock it.	gurase	t3_60drud

t3_60fbko	t1_df5z5kx	1490001694	I watch a lot of videos on my phone so the big screen is definitely a big deal for me. I put my 7+ in a kickstand case as well so I can prop it up and watch while I cook, eat, etc. Other reasons I like the 7+ include better battery life and additional camera features (2x optical zoom that has actually come in handy, and portrait mode which I've found is only good in strong natural light because the image gets darkened).	sebastianrenix	t3_60fbko
t3_60clqa	t1_df5zwbp	1490004129	All you have to do is remove the old Touch ID sensor and place it on the new screen assembly. Most 3rd party screen assemblies don't come with a Touch ID component for this reason.	djmexi	t1_df5w282

t3_60clqa	t1_df65xdz	1490017293	Because you stated you don't know why people always ask if screen replacements will solve their issues or if they are even possible, because according to you it can ALWAYS be replaced.  You also said the only variable that decides whether it'll work or not is how bent the housing is, which isn't true at all	Rogerss93	t1_df65n0i
t3_60clqa	t1_df66e6t	1490017964	Again, I’m not going to list every possibility of why a screen replacement might not work.

Its camera is way better than the 7's and the big screen is a plus if you want to watch videos, read books or play games.  If you're going to use your iPhone just to send texts and make phone calls, then I'd suggest you the 7. But if you're going to use it the way it's intended to be used, I'd definitely recommend you the 7 Plus.  Also, I would not get the 32GB version. It's likely not enough storage, with 128GB being the "sweet spot".	Jeoyeyo	t3_60fbko
t3_60fbko	t1_df68hg3	1490020732	7 Plus definitely. Better screen, better camera, bigger battery and overall a better phone.	arhamjamal	t3_60fbko

t3_60fbko	t1_df6medn	1490036146	If you take a lot of pictures, the 7+ is definitely worth it.

I've blown up a few now into 8x10s and people think they are professional pictures. Just amazing. I've also found that I really like the extra screen space. I do a lot of productivity stuff with my iPhone and the bigger screen has been really nice for that.	Wdc331	t3_60fbko

t3_60k7bp	t1_df72t82	1490055604	I can't see why it wouldn't work. But, just a few things to keep in mind:  * Make sure the logic board you buy works. It's usually the most expensive part and a dead one isn't fun. * Make sure the logic board is NOT locked either by any cellular company or iCloud; otherwise you won't be able to activate it and it'll be useless. * If you care about Touch ID, make sure the logic board comes with the home button it is paired with.

t3_60mf75	t1_df7z5g0	1490112567	My cables do that all the time too!  We have three iPhones  ( a 6, a 6S, and an SE) and an iPad, so I'm not sure which device causes this, but I'm replacing cables frequently (a cable dies every month or two).  I've used both real Apple cables as well as various knockoffs (anything from $5 walmart specials to higher-quality Monoprice cables to real Apple cables)  Now, I also have cables that have literally lasted years -- also used with the same devices.    For me, it seems like it's always the cable attached to the power strip on my desk that goes -- other cables in other parts of the house (or car, or at work) last a LOT longer.  I've swapped out the USB charger -- using different 1A and 2.1A chargers there.  It doesn't seem to make a difference.  But it's always the cables attached to the same outlet.  Maybe the power coming from this outlet isn't clean and I'm getting spikes that are causing it?  I really don't know - the outlet seems to work just fine otherwise.    Nothing seems wrong with the phones themselves.  At first I was thinking there must be a rough spot inside the connector so I'm scraping the contacts off -- but a visual inspection using a bright light doesn't show anything unusual and the fact that other cables elsewhere seem to just last forever kind of discounts that theory too.  I don't know.  I've just been buying the cheap cables and throwing them when they stop working.  The fact that the cables are reversible helps -  usually when one stops working, I can just flip it around and use the other side for a while before having to throw the cable.	jokerswild_	t3_60mf75

I don't have the discoloration, and I blow the dust out of my port and and very careful with the phone regarding dirt.  Just look at this under a 10x magnifier. Those copper "finger" contacts are paper thin, and wear out very quickly with repeated plugging/unplugging.   Sorry, it's a very poor connector design.	fmalloy	t3_60mf75

t3_60mf75	t1_df8fhlp	1490130675	Weird. I have 4 different lightning cables I bought close to the same time (within 2-3 years ago).

I don't think I'm doing anything special, aside from having 4 cables maybe. I will say that I am always very gentle and deliberate about pulling the plug out. I grip it right at the top with my thumb and I'm careful to edge it out straight back. Not quite OCD level like I am defusing a bomb, but I am gentle. I never just yank it out by the cord or anything.	Fendahl_core	t3_60mf75

However, it is detrimental if you let it drain a bit and keep charging it often. For example, charging it to 100%&gt;draining it to 80%&gt;charging it to 100% again and etc.	Eshmam14	t3_60bpw9

t3_60krp7	t1_df9a2o6	1490185447	I find Google Maps to be less accurate with new highway systems. There's this bundle of highways in my area (495-395-95 meet together), there's exits left and right with over passes and ramps everywhere. Google Maps always makes me take the exit that will make me immediately have to cut across 4 lanes for another exit, while I can just take the appropriate exit to gp straight there. These exits aren't exactly new (2+ years) already so I don't know why it's still like that.  I find Waze to be much better for heavy traffic too. Google Maps doesn't react to road closures as quickly since Waze is crowd sourced.	Yo_2T	t1_df82m98
t3_60krp7	t1_df9cc15	1490189123	Interesting. I believe you, but when I used to drive around DC a lot I found Google Maps to be much easier to follow than Waze. Waze just looks confusing sometimes, and it also told me to get into an EZ-Pass only lane and I didn't have one at the time. Also isn't Waze connected to Google Maps? I thought they shared the crowd sourcing reports of accidents and closures.	Ninjewx	t1_df9a2o6
t3_60krp7	t1_df9dcd5	1490190499	Hah EZ-Pass. The default setting on Google Maps has "No toll roads" set to off, so Google Maps always directs us to take the 495 or 95 Express lanes. My not so tech savvy dad got a few charges cuz he had no idea.  And not sure about Google Maps utilizing Waze's traffic reports. That one time Route 123 NB was closed (and still is), GM kept making me go back to the closed road, while Waze figured out a detour immediately. Don't know if they delay the reports a bit to make sure they were legit or something.	Yo_2T	t1_df9cc15

If there is absolutely no indication of anything, how to differentiate that from any other hoax?

t3_60vrvw	t1_df9o2tr	1490202375	That's why there's a display unit at every Apple Store (assuming you purchased in store) for you to try.   For instance, I decided to try an iPhone against after not using one since the 4 and thought 32GB would be enough. After using for about a month, I realised it didn't suit my needs so swapped it for 128GB.   Lucky I had a 3 month return date.	Un-trollable	t1_df9nhb3

t3_60xsr8	t1_dfahwqw	1490236654	Apple is the small phone lovers last hope. Hopefully they keep making them. I got the 6s but may switch to the next SE version if they make one.	rouyal	t3_60xsr8
t3_60l0ur	t1_dfahxsc	1490236692	Wrong. I pick it up and put it down on my desk all day long. It touches rough surfaces all the time. Never dropped it because I'm an adult, but I don't baby it in the least.	BoostMakesMeHard	t1_df7rj9e
t3_60l0ur	t1_dfai2h6	1490236867	I have a jet black using without a case since day 1 too. On this same angle and light I can see all the scratches, just like yours (maybe even worst), but 90% of the times you look at it, you can barely see any scratch, because the deep black masks them.  also, this is the first iPhone I use without a case with confidence. the grip is great and the feeling of a caseless phone too (no lips around the screen).   no regrets, I'm ok having the scratches in exchange for a better experience with the device.	rafael000	t1_df7ooe4
t3_60xf3v	t1_dfaiel0	1490237325	You might be right and I hope so because I feel like we've been waiting for 10.3 for forever. I'm wondering if the Product RED iPhone 7 really requires an updated version of iOS. After all, it's just a cosmetic change, right? All the internal hardware is the same.  Also, "iPad" is available for order on the 24th but doesn't arrive in stores until the following week according to the [press release](http://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/03/new-9-7-inch-ipad-features-stunning-retina-display-and-incredible-performance.html).	raskren	t1_dfa4u9i
t3_60xsr8	t1_dfaiihh	1490237469	They did. The just upped the storage capacity for them.	ant1992	t1_dfahwqw
t3_60xsr8	t1_dfaj6au	1490238395	Sure thing! It's also good to see how Apple takes inspirations from Android phones and Samsung / LG / Motorolla / Google take some inspiration from Apple as well. This helps to bring some of the best features presented by one brand through other phones sooner or later.	Kssio_Aug	t1_dfadki3
t3_60xf3v	t1_dfak7tq	1490239911	Most likely Product Red iPhones are already on 10.3 and they will release the update on the same day it launches	Skeuomorphic_	t1_dfa27kt
t3_60xsr8	t1_dfak81e	1490239920	One nice thing about iOS is that all of Google's apps are on it, and many people think they're even nicer on iOS than on Android. I've switched between an iPhone 7 and Pixel, and I find it easier to use Google's services like Google Photos or Google Keep, just because it's easier to sync across all platforms. Frankly I like Google Photos better than Apple's Photos apps, because you're not locked in. But - one thing you'll find is that first party Apple apps generally play nicer with other first party apps in iOS. So, sometimes it helps to just go with the default Apple app instead of a 3rd-party one.   In terms of folder management, it's just something you sort of get used to. If I needed to manage files outside of an app, I'd usually leverage Google Drive or Dropbox as a workaround.   Hope this helps!	theJamesKPolk	t3_60xsr8
t3_60xsr8	t1_dfalolg	1490242184	Yep, the only thing holding me back about it was because Google Drive didn't accept offline folders. However, I've just discovered the iCloud Drive. It will be enough to manage some offline files when needed! =)	Kssio_Aug	t1_dfak81e

t3_60yf7h	t1_dfan0c6	1490244466	Maybe it won't be so useless.  It's a fantastic idea limited by Apple's restrictions to do anything significant.	Saxi	t3_60yf7h
t3_60yf7h	t1_dfanls0	1490245586	Can anyone give me an example of what I might be able to do with this feature?  Like could I automate the series of finicky steps involved in watermarking photos on my iPad Pro with Pixelmator?	follow_your_bliss	t3_60yf7h
t3_60yf7h	t1_dfaob1d	1490247053	Apple is finally getting back into software. With the release of Clips as well sounds like they're putting a lot more focus in their software again.	expothefuture	t3_60yf7h
t3_60yf7h	t1_dfaog2g	1490247363	It's probably basic steps right now...similar to IFTTT. Almost quick action steps for everyday things.  Like "remind me at home" so when you get home it might remind you of a list you made with another app. Or "coffee shops near by". Quick actions that would require combining different applications. They allow apps to talk to each other easier.	expothefuture	t1_dfanls0
t3_60xf3v	t1_dfaogd5	1490247380	Sweet. Been on 10.3 for awhile now with the betas. No issues on my device. Yet. I always say a little prayer when updating the betas haha	drebux	t1_dfa8q5a

t3_60yf7h	t1_dfaprda	1490250594	There are a TON of possibilities. There are featured workflows you can download (all for free of course) and you can make your own.   [Here are some that I have downloaded and made (I'm not really a heavy user)](https://imgur.com/a/HRBIT) In the second screenshot you can see a simple program I've made to login to my school's network. They gave us premade passwords which are jumbled up uppercase and lowercase letters and random numbers. When I first got it I didn't even try to remember my password but instantly made the workflow that copies the password I put in and opens a URL. (I've made all this before Safari could remember passwords.)  There are a ton of functions to add and they've been pretty consistent with adding new ones with each update. There are also basic programming functions like IF statements, input and output variables which you can later input somewhere else. For example:      X = user input         send iMessage with the text: Hey, I'll be late X minutes  Sorry for my formatting I'm on mobile	karlo_m	t1_dfanls0

t3_60xsr8	t1_dfarbuv	1490255121	To be completely fair, at the resolution of the SE model the A9 chip is extremely good. In fact, it's still slightly better than the current Android flagships, so even without the spec bump it's still a very solid purchase. They should've upped the front camera and added 3D Touch though.	kadupse	t1_dfar8e2
t3_60xsr8	t1_dfarsye	1490256624	Yeah agreed. Even though Apple might not refresh the SE this year, they might next year. SE users don't really care about specs that much so we might see apple update the SE every other year.	realniggaonehunna	t1_dfarbuv

t3_60yf7h	t1_dfaup4b	1490265896	Yes: https://www.jordanmerrick.com/posts/watermarking-images-with-workflow/  I have a workflow that takes a picture from my photo stream, uploads it to Dropbox, gets the public share link for that, logs in to my server via SSH and tells my IRC client to paste the link to channels I've selected.  I also use it to track my water and caffeine intake, a few taps from my Apple Watch or notification screen enters the data to Health in seconds.  Frederico Viticci of Macstories has done tons of workflow actions: https://www.macstories.net/tag/workflow/ and he has a multi-part podcast series about how to use it.	theshrike	t1_dfanls0

t3_60yf7h	t1_dfav951	1490267444	I could list some, sure.  I write a blog, so I can remember two workflows. The first takes 3 pictures (selected by me) and stitch them side by side. Useful when I want to show screenshots of an app.  And the second one posts to Wordpress for me so I don't have to do it manually.  I have one to save blog post ideas.  I also sometimes save covers of books for inspiration. But I don't want them there along with my photos. So every few days I run this workflow where I select some images from Photo Roll, they get moved to Dropbox and deleted from my phone.  I keep a journal. So every day at 10pm I get a notification that, when tapped, runs my journal workflow. It asks me what happened in the day, prompts me to pick some info from a list, queries a local weather API and save it all on Evernote.  When I watch a movie, I use a Movie Log workflow. I just have to type the name of the movie. Workflow queries IMDB for a lot of info. Release year, name of the director, genre, average metacritic score, etc. Then it saves all of that along with a big image of the movie's poster on Evernote.  I have a workflow to download videos from YouTube. One to let my wife know I'll be late (it sends a picture of my location on google maps). One to log how much fuel I put in my motorcycle and what I paid for it.  Well, I think I gave a good overview of workflows on all aspects of my life. Work, personal life, my quantified self hobby. I can be more specific if anyone is interested.	bighi	t1_dfaux42
t3_60yf7h	t1_dfavk6n	1490268249	Even unrooted you can do a heap load more with tasker than you can on iOS. For one, there are plugins with tasker. On tasker I can automate anything I could do in a shell.   That's what iOS really needs. I would chew off someone else's arm to be able to automate *nix commands in a shell on my phone again.  *though I guess everything could be done over ssh*	treyf711	t1_dfaupqi
t3_60xsr8	t1_dfaw52h	1490269608	I was a longtime android user, had the Galaxy S2 all the way to the S5 and a brand less camera less android phone for work. However, I noticed that my Galaxies always had a tendency to slow down considerably after a years use (even with a lot of memory) so I decided to get the iphone 7 this year.   The transition was fairly simple, besides not having a physical back button (you get used to this quite easily) and I think touch gestures are very well engineered and thought out they make the phone easy to use.    What I miss? The headphone jack obviously it is rather an inconvenience but the SE is also a good jump if you're prefer smaller screens.   As for apps?... I don't think there's anything on Android that Apple can't compare to.   I don't think I'll be turning back to Android for a long time. I love my iphone! The camera is also awesome.	stereopaper	t1_dfasvjz

t3_60xsr8	t1_dfawub1	1490271055	Welcome to the iPhone club. Now once you start getting other apple products you will fall deeper in love. The way all of apple products communicate with each other is on a whole another level that no other mobile OS can touch.	iBZRK	t3_60xsr8
t3_60yf7h	t1_dfax3i9	1490271543	This 'have to root to get it to do anything useful' thing that especially iOS-focused goalpost-movers have is entirely a fallacy. You can get it to do a shitload of stuff without root.	gewruiaqhgeuiabghrey	t1_dfav1ie
t3_60xsr8	t1_dfax55w	1490271630	The transition has been quite simple for me too. The things I miss the most from Android, as I said in the OP, is file management and scheduled mobile data.  The thing is that iPhone doens't allow you to manage files, photos, and other things outside some specific apps.  ie.: In Android I could create a folder called "Things" and throw there documents, photos, and any kind of file I wanted; I could also open Google Drive, OneDrive or Dropbox and transfer multiple files to these folders easily. In the other hand, you can't do this with iPhone; at least not in a proper simple way; you can make Google and OneDrive files available offline or you can create a folder in iCloud and access them offline in your iPhone, but you will also notice that transfer these cloud files between one another is not as simple (as you can only send one file by one to iCloud) or as intuitive as it is Android. I believe this happens cause in iPhone I'm under the impression they believe each file belongs to it's own app, they don't really want you to move them around in the system.  For me at least this is the hardest adaption, cause it recquires a new perspective about how to manage files (access, share, import, export) and it's limitations. Today, with cloud systems though, you can at least manage them one way or another, creating your clouded folders and acessing your most used or necessary files offline in them; so, besides not exactly the most easy and intuitive way to manage your documents it helps a lot.  Other than that though, the system is pretty amazing. Everything is very smooth, there are a lot of features that are well integrated to make your life easier and that are way more than simple gimmicks (you will actually use these features cause they really work), after some exploring things are very intuitive, and Apple gives you some really nice apps right out of the box such as facetime [video calls], imessages [great message app full of nice features], garageband [create your own musics or sounds; it's really great], podcasts [sign to your favorite podcasts channel] and imovie [create your own movie with your pictures and videos]. It also seems that the iPhones have great build quality overall, and the iOS is made with their architecture in mind, so that may explain why even with inferior specs they still work so damn well.  In resume, if you don't mind or can adapt to the file management limitations, which with cloud services are easier to deal with, it is a REALLY great phone and easy to adapt.	Kssio_Aug	t1_dfasvjz
t3_60yf7h	t1_dfax7t2	1490271766	i know but there wasn't really anything that interesting for me... i was hoping to be able to manage my location services with it and it wasn't possible with it so... for me it was mostly useless...   not saying that tasker is bad... but without root access it's losing some of its appeal.   edit: i was faithfull to android for a very long time, because of all the abilties you had with the devices... but then i realized that i don't really make use of many of those abilties or that i invest huge amount of time in getting things to work that i could use better for something else... also i witnessed how great my ipad (which was a gift) was working together with my macbook and that my android phone was basically the bump in my road to productivity... so i decided to switch and though i miss some stuff from android and hate some stuff on ios i don't regret that decision.	lemoche	t1_dfax3i9

t3_60yf7h	t1_dfazqq4	1490275781	They are similar in which both automate stuff, but the similarity ends there.  IFTTT automates stuff from one cloud service to another, and it can only do 1 action when triggered, not many. It is about reacting to events on a cloud service.  Workflow is more about automating stuff on your phone, and it can do from 1 to a million actions (or more) when triggered. It works by manually starting an action.  I use both, for different purposes. Workflow makes my phone a powerful work machine. IFTTT does some cloud integration when I'm not looking.  I don't know if I was clear enough. I can explain more.	bighi	t1_dfaxgse
t3_60yf7h	t1_dfb06nu	1490276394	How do you do the notification at 10pm thing? Also, the Google Maps thing. You have a good set of Workflows.	mergadroid	t1_dfav951
t3_60yf7h	t1_dfb0kds	1490276904	I think that any individual action, by itself, is not that life changing. But it's the combination of them that makes it powerful.  Actions like getting the contents of a web page. Doesn't look that much. Saving pictures, not a big thing.  But if you think that you can look at pages, get images from them, crop the images, stitch them together, save them in Dropbox and send a command (over SSH) to tell your other computer to do something with them... now it becomes interesting.	bighi	t1_dfawbvb
t3_60yf7h	t1_dfb0ug4	1490277266	Workflow can't create notifications at specific times, so I use Launch Center Pro for that.  When I tap the notification, it runs a Launch Center Pro action that runs a workflow.  But I'm only doing it that way because I forgot Siri could do it. If you open any Workflow, you can activate Siri and say something like "remind me of this every day at 10pm".   Siri understand "this" as the current workflow. So you when click the Reminders notification, it will trigger the workflow. You can even use this Siri/Reminders integration to create reminders for a workflow when you get home, or leave your car.  If you're interested in Workflow, there is a Gallery inside the app. There you can find very good ones created by other users.	bighi	t1_dfb06nu

t3_60yf7h	t1_dfb2mo3	1490279519	Thank you! That's actually really helpful. I may give workflow a try again. I feel like I didn't give it a chance. But understanding the difference gives me some ideas....	Wdc331	t1_dfazqq4
t3_60yf7h	t1_dfb3gke	1490280512	On the one hand, this is really exciting since we might finally get deeper system access. On the other hand, Apple has a habit of taking out functionality when they absorb a company/app, like how the Siri app had features that were removed when they built Siri in to iOS.	wpcolorado	t3_60yf7h
t3_60yf7h	t1_dfb442x	1490281261	The app revamped the Gallery a couple months ago. Now there are a lot of workflows there, created by other users. It may be a good starting point.  And the app is free now, so... nothing to lose. =)	bighi	t1_dfb2mo3

t3_6189l5	t1_dfd5kid	1490385892	Having come from Android (loving my iPhone) why not a button to turn off location? Yes yes, fine, okay I know it technically regulates itself and you can control which apps use it - fine. But there's times when it makes sense to just leave off. For example - if you have a widget that relies on location and you take a second to glance at it, the location stays on for a good while. It's a battery killer and overheats the phone.

t3_61e2uh	t1_dfe04ct	1490441596	&gt;still trying to get used to the no back button  There should be an arrow like this:  `&lt;` or you can swipe towards the screen strarting from the edges.  found in apps like safari.  &gt;So, as someone who hasn't been with iOS in quite some time, any recommendations? Accessories, Apps, Settings configuration etc?  Wifi goes off when I my iphone goes to sleep (screen turns off when idle), so what I did was set `auto-lock` in `display &amp; brightness` setting to `never` so the screen never locks when idle.	_Ver01	t3_61e2uh

t3_61frv5	t1_dfex0x8	1490493744	I think the idea was that Raise to Wake would be enough, since they introduced both changes at the same time. It's not always perfect though.	kurros	t1_dfevkky
t3_61frv5	t1_dfexgam	1490494402	My brain at roughly noon on Saturday March 25th. It has other hobbies like thinking about other stuff when people take too long to tell stories and justifying expensive and needless purchases. What are the charges detective?	tonywartooth	t1_dfewng7

t3_61frv5	t1_dfez92f	1490497207	To me there's no reason to go from 9 to 10. I don't need new emojis, I don't need the new gimmicks in iMessage, there doesn't seem to be anything new that seems appealing at all, and finally the act of getting rid of swipe to unlock is just dumb.   I'm happy with iOS 9. I know I'll have to update sometime, but it's a perfectly functional OS with all the things I need.	mydoortotheworld	t1_dfec4sb

t3_61e2uh	t1_dfezobs	1490497893	So I moved over from a Note 5 back in October (I had used Android since 2011, save for a brief stint with Windows Phone) and there is a back button, in a sense. You just swipe to the right from the edge of the screen to go back within pages or a web browser, or force touch the edge to see your current apps. Also, apps will have a small "go to back to ___app" button in the top left or right corner. The no discrete back button thing was one of the big things holding me back from switching but you will get used to it in time.	CisternaChyli	t3_61e2uh
t3_61frv5	t1_dfezpp3	1490497953	Yeah I do....except when I have my gloves on at work and I then need to enter a password I never wanted to have in the first place!	drukenhard	t1_dfeyfgf
t3_61frv5	t1_dff3i09	1490504606	Funny enough I've always felt from ios 7 and up the performance and bugginess of the platform has increased drastically lol.

t3_61frv5	t1_dff5pci	1490509236	Swiping to unlock and the new music app are basically why I'm still on 9. And I am always the one who updates as soon as an update is up and tells everybody to update. It's the first time with Apple that I just don't get it.	EthniK_ElectriK	t1_dfe7nwf

t3_61frv5	t1_dff7o2l	1490514442	No, everything is just a hell of a lot slower on iOS 9 compared to 6. It has more apps, but it's so much slower.	matthew28845	t1_dff7mvl

t3_61m5qs	t1_dffj8pt	1490543750	Have you tried doing a factory reset on the phone itself?   Also, have you tried putting it in DFU mode and then attempting to connect it to one of the computers? Depending on how long you've owned the phone, you might just be able to return it if it's still giving you problems after doing all that.  EDIT: What phone and what version are you on? To find that out, go to Settings - General - Update to let it see which version it's on.	QuantumDrej	t3_61m5qs
t3_61m5qs	t1_dffk7ip	1490545172	First try (if you haven't already) the good ol' hard reset. Hold home + power buttons until phone reboots (power and volume down on iP7)	Benediktxvi	t3_61m5qs
t3_61m5qs	t1_dffko0v	1490545830	Check your charge port for lint, take a pin or toothpick or whatever will fit really, ideally plastic or polymer but I use paperclips as they're abundant, and clear out the lint from the pins. May work, I know it's been a problem for me in the past.	Fresh613	t3_61m5qs
t3_61m5qs	t1_dffll3b	1490547114	Will edit most of this into the OP but.  Phone is 5s I am not on the newest version, though I don't wish to be; surely it should still sync just one version behind right?  No I haven't tried DFU mode. And no I haven't factory reset. A factory reset deletes all my data correct?	El3mentGamer	t1_dffj8pt
t3_61m5qs	t1_dffllvj	1490547143	Have rebooted my phone. But not while plugged in. Thanks for the thought!	El3mentGamer	t1_dffk7ip
t3_61m5qs	t1_dffln4m	1490547194	Will double check sure. I think everything should be fine though; also I AM using my stock cord and have also tried other cords.	El3mentGamer	t1_dffko0v
t3_61m5qs	t1_dffloa7	1490547240	Have you cleaned it out before? You'd be surprised how much stuff gets wedged in there.	Fresh613	t1_dffln4m
t3_61m5qs	t1_dfflp98	1490547277	I actually helped someone the other day with this issue. Couldn't find what exactly in the settings it was, but resetting the settings fixed it.   Try that before an annoying factory reset.	IRSoup	t3_61m5qs

t3_61m5qs	t1_dfflun4	1490547482	New info! Rad. Can you elaborate on how to reset, and what gets reset in my settings?	El3mentGamer	t1_dfflp98
t3_61m5qs	t1_dfflwfy	1490547549	I've not to be honest. Will definitely look at both the charger cord and computer USB inputs	El3mentGamer	t1_dffloa7
t3_61m5qs	t1_dfflzk8	1490547666	Should only be your phone port. But checking your computer USB can't hurt either I guess. Lemme know what happens.	Fresh613	t1_dfflwfy
t3_61m5qs	t1_dffm574	1490547885	It's under general, very bottom to reset, then choose the very top "reset all settings".   This resets anything that was changed from the default settings. Whether that be your finger print, passcode, some app settings, iCloud, etc.	IRSoup	t1_dfflun4
t3_61m5qs	t1_dffm8eq	1490548010	Thanks much. I'm not opposed to factory resetting; but definitely was hoping for something more subtle.   I didn't know you could do this!	El3mentGamer	t1_dffm574
t3_61m5qs	t1_dffn592	1490549272	Just to add to this, once you've cleared the port out (carefully avoiding the pins on the bottom of the device) check them for any damage such as missing, bent or corroded pins. Since the phone is charging but not being recognised after you've tried the steps others have listed this may be the cause. Some pins are used for charging and others for data transfer.   Edit: also as /u/Quantumdrej suggested a DFU restore, this will update you to the latest version of iOS so you might want to think about how valuable being on 10.0.2 is.	FuckNope	t1_dffko0v

t3_61p4vj	t1_dfg8hpp	1490578408	It is a bit baffling as to why there is absolutely no customisation for CC other than toggling lock screen and in-app access. I never use airplay or airdrop, and whilst I do use nightshift, I don't really need a toggle because I've set it to auto.	newfonehudis	t3_61p4vj
t3_61p4vj	t1_dfg8n8k	1490578632	Right? That's actually one of the reasons I switched over to android a few years back. I like a lot of customization options in my phones.

t3_61p4vj	t1_dfg96ig	1490579399	Yeah that's one of the big things I miss from Android is to customize the quick settings/CC buttons. I imagine they will try to put the low power mode in this year, I doubt they will put in customization for it.	taboo007	t3_61p4vj
t3_61p4vj	t1_dfg9bib	1490579595	I loved all of the customization options when I had an android. Hopefully Apple will give us a little bit more in the future.	MrBeachBum51	t1_dfg96ig
t3_61p9y9	t1_dfg9pp4	1490580164	It's one of my biggest complaints with iOS after having been on Android for so long previously - that and downloading and setting custom ringtones was so easy on Android.	hyzerflip3	t3_61p9y9
t3_61p4vj	t1_dfga7v7	1490580896	I use DND daily. Every time I go into a meeting I enable DND. I have never used low power mode.   I am pretty sure Apple is tracking all of this and knows what most people use more.   But I do agree about night shift. It is scheduled and I never touch it outside of that schedule.	gdbjr	t1_dfg8n8k

t3_61p9y9	t1_dfgcz2s	1490585012	My solution is to use an alternative music manager and player. Can play music from lots of cloud storage locations, download locally, and out of my preferred file manager.   Built in music app is a tumor they've not tried to fix.	AndrewZabar	t3_61p9y9
t3_61p9y9	t1_dfgd1ev	1490585115	Please elaborate more, keeping in mind that I have switched from being an Android user since the original HTC G1 all the way to the Note 5, and have only just switched to iOS as of 1 week ago. Thank you.	makemedie	t1_dfgcz2s
t3_61p4vj	t1_dfgdi75	1490585864	I get the feeling Apple thought users would want to toggle Night Shift more than we actually do - for example if doing something that crucially relies on colour.  I'd take a Low Power Mode toggle over a Night Shift toggle, or hey, both.	swanny246	t1_dfg8hpp
t3_61p4vj	t1_dfgf71s	1490588735	I would like to see this happen eventually, but until then, there's /r/jailbreak.	cocobandicoot	t3_61p4vj
t3_61p9y9	t1_dfgg1di	1490590316	I think what AndrewZabar is trying to say is— The official Apple "Music" app is strictly Apple's domain. In order to "encourage" you to buy music from Apple, they've hobbled its ability to get data from anywhere besides the the iTunes/Music servers, or manually through the iTunes desktop software.  There are third-party solutions worth researching on the App Store, although I haven't tried any of them, myself.	adamsak	t1_dfgd1ev
t3_61p4vj	t1_dfgh8bn	1490592718	Or at least put in long press actions on the buttons. Why can't I hold down the wifi toggle to go to wifi settings. Hey here's this awesome force touch feature we don't implement at all!	any_other	t3_61p4vj

t3_61p4vj	t1_dfgi2w1	1490594558	But why does it have to be 3d touch? It's screwing people that don't have the 6s/7 when a long press works just as well.	STOLEN_JEEP_STUFF	t1_dfghgwf

t3_61p9y9	t1_dfgkp78	1490601400	If you jailbreak , you can import music from your youtube app, or actually any app, and have free itunes music download, spotify, deezer, every music you can possibly imagine 😱	mo2fdwxd	t3_61p9y9
t3_61p9y9	t1_dfgl5es	1490602766	The way I get downloaded MP3s to my iphone without an Itunes sync is either via the Google Play app or through Dropbox. Dropbox lets you save files onto the device for playback via the Dropbox app, but you can only play one file at a time. If they updated the app to have music controls it would be a huge improvement.  Google Play syncs the MP3 folder on your computer with your account so when you log into the app on your phone you can play whatever you have in your folder. Once you play a particular track, it automatically gets downloaded for offline playback.	tussilladra	t3_61p9y9

t3_61p4vj	t1_dfglg1k	1490603704	You can jailbreak it technically with Mach-portal, however it's a little bit "hacky" currently .   Once 10.3 is realised you "may" see a more complete jailbreak. There's flipcontrolcentre to customise control centre toggles , or ccsettings IF it gets updated to support iOS 10.   Hope that helps	Clivelethbridge	t1_dfgl8gj
t3_61p9y9	t1_dfgo18i	1490611718	Yeah and if you have a computer itunes is still the best option. Simply save music to whatever folder on your computer you want to sync, tell itunes to sync that folder and plug in your phone. It takes no time. I have to assume somebody who can afford a 128GB 7Plus has an old laptop or deaktop around that can run itunes	sglville	t1_dfgf8hk

So if I download anything on my phone, I just send it to my Box account, and it shows up on my Google Music app a few minutes later.

t3_61p4vj	t1_dfgwz5a	1490626822	Every time I hear "I want to be able to customize X", I look for what people list as their primary motivations/things they want to change out. And invariably, they fall into niche use cases which don't justify a broader customization ability.  Lower Power Mode? What is wrong with your phone that you are ever manually engaging Low Power Mode? That is not something you're supposed to turn on regularly. "Regularly" being the key word, as the context here is customizing control center...a place where frequently quick action toggles exist. This just isn't one of them.  I agree with others that Night Shift is oddly placed here since most users will set the auto mode and forget it...But I think that was done on purpose to help discoverability of the feature while it was new. I'd be willing to bet you'll see that swapped out in iOS 11.	Metriacanthosaurus	t3_61p4vj
t3_61sfsj	t1_dfgx9ux	1490627172	It really depends on which size you want; they're both excellent phones. The iPhone SE has a couple limitations like slightly slower Touch ID and no 3D Touch, but it also has significantly better battery life.  As for where you should buy the phone, I'd try to keep it local so you don't get scammed. Check your local Craigslist for listings, and always meet up at a carrier store for the transaction. That'll allow you to verify that the phone isn't blacklisted by the carrier, and you'll also be able to confirm that the phone isn't iCloud locked before you hand over any money.	greatcaffeine	t3_61sfsj
t3_61sfsj	t1_dfgxa2d	1490627179	An SE is cheaper and has the same internals. Also, the size is much more convenient.  Source: I have an SE and love it	alkalinepepper	t3_61sfsj
t3_61sfsj	t1_dfgynaf	1490628747	if you're worried about scams then why don't you just buy the phone straight from Apple.	buy_shiba	t1_dfgx9ux
t3_61sfsj	t1_dfh0k79	1490630982	Didn't OP say they wanted a phone that would last them several years?	greatcaffeine	t1_dfgyxem
t3_61sfsj	t1_dfh117f	1490631535	Personally, I always buy my phones from Apple or the carrier. OP said they wanted to save money, and I think Craigslist is the best/safest way to do that.	greatcaffeine	t1_dfgynaf
t3_61sfsj	t1_dfh1bw2	1490631872	I bought a SE last week. First day was rough lol. I went from a 6s plus to a galaxy j3 only because I broke the 6s plus. So a 5.5 inch to 5 inch to 4 inch. I noticed I hold the phone closer to my face now but your used to a 3.5 inch screen. Should be even better for you. Phone is great. Fast and no lag at all. Battery could be better. It's definitely not as good as everyone hypes it to be. I have all battery draining features and setting turned off and if I use it straight with almost no screen off time it will die in about 3 hours or less. Charges pretty quick though. Will be sending it back and getting a plus again.	Deeznoits	t3_61sfsj

My wife has one and it's pretty great, I'm thinking of jumping ship and getting a Pixel 2 whenever that releases.  Her Pixel 1 feels like it will last a few years no problem.	QuinnMallory	t1_dfh0k79
t3_61sfsj	t1_dfh32kc	1490633767	i have the 6s and while its smaller than the plus sized phones, I should have bought an SE.   I like smaller devices i can carry in my pocket	I_drive_all_over	t3_61sfsj

t3_61sfsj	t1_dfh4n87	1490635457	I'm a big fan of the SE. So much so that prefer it over my 7. With that said, since you're coming from the 4, the SE is not only cheaper, but you're more used to the overall size of the phone. Not that the 6s will be hard to get used to, but the battery on the SE will last you longer too.	n1ck1982	t3_61sfsj
t3_61sfsj	t1_dfh4ndn	1490635461	Part of my reply was just me being snarky, but there's definitely a lot of truth behind it. The Nexus 6, released in late 2014, is currently end-of-life and won't see another major Android update. We don't know how long the iPhone 6 released at about the same time will be supported for, but I guarantee it's at least a couple more years.  The Pixel is definitely the best Android phone on the market, and it's the one I'd recommend to anyone that doesn't like iOS for one reason or another. I just don't think Android phones have proven themselves to be great phones over the course of several years like iPhones have.	greatcaffeine	t1_dfh1mmp

t3_61p4vj	t1_dfh6e3r	1490637303	Never understood why there's no vibrate/silent toggle in the CC. That's literally the one function most people use at least 5 times a day.	8errard	t1_dfgbpr1

t3_61te7h	t1_dfhgin1	1490648420	Well I'm on Verizon and they just use deprioritization which basically just means if you hit a certain threshold of data usage a month, if you're on a congested tower, you will have less priority on the tower then people who use data  who haven't hit  the threshold	PleaseGoOutside	t1_dfhga44
t3_61te7h	t1_dfhgp04	1490648636	Not with unlimited. Deprioritization is very different from throttling. Throttling you're at 128kbps 24/7, as where with deprioritization you *might* be slowed down ***during times of congestion*** which isn't often unless you live in a congested market for your carrier... at which point you should probably think about switching anyways.	jakeuten	t1_dfhga44

Go to https://yalu.qwertyoruiop.com If iPhone 7 or Plus, get mach_portal (scroll down), otherwise yalu102 (iPhone 6s etc)  Start cydia impactor, drag the yalu102/mach_portal file right in the cydia impactor window, enter Apple id (create a random new one if you want) and then you're done. Open the app om your phone and you're good!  More info about jailbreak (safety etc) can be found at /r/jailbreak, check the sidebar!

t3_61te7h	t1_dfihe5q	1490710603	This update made my 6S so fast, it feels like I just bought a brand new phone. I'd highly recommend installing this!	ilega_dh	t3_61te7h
t3_61yr8n	t1_dfihvi3	1490711202	Saving you a click:  *Faster because*  - APFS (more modern filesystem) - Animations have been made faster (nothing to do with performance, but does make navigation faster)  *Slow to install because*  - APFS (updating the whole filesystem takes a bit of time)	Cykelero	t3_61yr8n
t3_61yr8n	t1_dfii7fr	1490711612	Don't seem to be faster though. Seem to be like on par with 10.2.1 on most cases. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xNJjjA8AZA	mitchytan92	t3_61yr8n

t3_61yr8n	t1_dfikew0	1490714169	I love the new update on my SE. Not that I've ever had a problem with it being slow or whatever but it feels snappier for real; also I have more space available now.	itsmegeorge	t3_61yr8n

Definitely one of the faster updates I've done.   PS: Just want to make note that I decided to rebuild my phone after the update, and it's much faster than it ever was along with better battery.	TigerTeller	t1_dfikarl
t3_61yr8n	t1_dfilspl	1490715671	Not sure of snppier. My 6s before 10.3 was left only 200mb. After updated, it gained 2.84gb, wah... that's a lot to me. More amazing, the storage increases from 2.84gb to 2.92gb after several hours, now after almost 1 day, it is 3.1gb. I didnt delete anything. It is true amazing for my 16gb 6s.	christausky	t3_61yr8n

t3_61yr8n	t1_dfip1z7	1490719101	Props, but most updates are pretty quick if you rebuild when you install. The concern is that converting your filesystem will take time.	MisterFizzster	t1_dfikns3
t3_61yr8n	t1_dfip1zd	1490719101	Longer to install? It took me the same time to update. Maybe 5-10 minutes on a 256GB model.	Dallas2888	t3_61yr8n

t3_61yr8n	t1_dfiptxe	1490719906	Don't think you can turn that on or off. For me it will pop up a few times asking me if I wanna install the new update, and if I keep hitting No Later, eventually the badge count goes away.	Yo_2T	t1_dfioitx
t3_61yr8n	t1_dfiqcwf	1490720445	Yes, it did fill up again after last update 10.2.   Just wonder what these cache are.

t3_61zs44	t1_dfityph	1490724172	How carplay lags so far behind is surprising. I've been using it since shortly after head units were available with it, and while it has gotten better, it's still so rough around the edges. iOS is amazing, how Apple is content with the state carplay has been in since launch Is beyond me.	tymoo22	t3_61zs44

It makes you really think about what you actually need and want on your phone, so I do it about every month or so, but I did it after the update (even though I just did it last week) specifically for the new file system to be blank.	TigerTeller	t1_dfisrtl

t3_61zs44	t1_dfixznf	1490728512	I feel that same way about Android, I love Android and still keep up with it. I should say it's not like the carplay experience is awful, I use it daily, it's far beyond what the stock Honda UI was like. But I feel like with the time it's been out in the wild, it should be an excellent experience by now.	tymoo22	t1_dfix3fr

t3_61zs44	t1_dfj2end	1490733255	Definitely like the Carplay UI better, but Siri is a joke and everyone who has used her more than once knows this.   Whatever Google is doing, Apple needs to do it too.	XeraanTruss	t3_61zs44
t3_61zs44	t1_dfj31lj	1490733952	Also, I have a friend Yuri and my iphone was never able to find him in the phone book if I try voicing his name, I had to rename him to Yorik in my phonebook (took me several tries with different nicknames) so Siri finally is able to phone him properly.	algalkin	t1_dfixnhu
t3_61zs44	t1_dfj37iu	1490734135	The "it looks better" argument is useless in a car setting... you're supposed to be eyes on the road. Google just shows you the info you need, song, destinations, etc. at a glance without having to dive into each app. I argue that while having the apps and black screen is more pleasing aesthetically, functionally it is useless. Especially when paired with the subpar voice recognition.	college_bound_baby	t3_61zs44
t3_61zs44	t1_dfj380j	1490734151	You can teach Siri how to pronounce names correctly. Either reply to her and tell her to learn how to pronounce the name or tell her that's not how you pronounce the name. Or you can edit the contact directly and add phonetic first and last names.	c0des	t1_dfixnhu
t3_61zs44	t1_dfj3n46	1490734617	I don't want google to "suggest" info. I want the UI to resemble my phone with icons and ill navigate through them at the lights.

t3_61zs44	t1_dfj3x6x	1490734927	To that, it might be illegal. I'm pretty sure it would be considered distracted driving here in Canada, although I'm not 100% sure.

t3_61zs44	t1_dfj65do	1490737528	What a crock of garbage. They're using what looks to be a stock, entry level system without a dedicated, directional or calibrated microphone, guy in the glasses is mumbling while talking to Siri and mispronouncing places like "Toronto" and didn't even try using "Jacob" with Siri instead of whatever the hell he was saying before, but at least they got the aesthetics portion correct.   I've been using CarPlay ever since my Pioneer 4000NEX got the update a few years ago, and have had no where near the number of issues these guys are having. Name recognition is always spot on, I pronounce the address clearly and include the city and province, and the dictation for text messages is almost always correct the first time.   I don't know what I expected from a YouTube channel with only 5k subs, though.   Edit: And while we're at it, why wasn't this done on a garage or somewhere else where outside sound couldn't influence the test? A controlled environment for a test that requires a great deal of sound accuracy seems like a no brainer for me. External stimuli can skew the results quite drastically, as we see here.  And as /u/C0des above stated:  You can teach Siri how to pronounce names correctly. Either reply to her and tell her to learn how to pronounce the name or tell her that's not how you pronounce the name. Or you can edit the contact directly and add phonetic first and last names.  This would have drastically helped with Siri picking up on a foreign name like that.  Edit 2: I put a contact called "Jakub W" in my iPhone 7 Plus 128GB and Siri had no issue calling them when I pronounced it like the guy in the video.   So y'all keep downvoting, it doesn't change the fact that I'm right.	L33tMasta	t3_61zs44

I didn't know people just suddenly decided to opt out of upgrading their stereo systems for better feature such as directional and dedicated microphones. I guess the dealerships no longer offer that. At least at Hyundai, they might not.   &gt; We tried saying "Jacob" off camera and it did the same thing  Convenient that it was off camera and not properly tested on camera like an actual head to head. I guess we can just leave details out and take bias reviewers at their word, then.   &gt; You're welcome to come back and check out our channel in a few months when we're at 100,000 subs   Big pass there, chief.

t3_61zs44	t1_dfj71ld	1490738598	You have to remember, iOS didn't get copy/paste until like iOS 3 or something. Apple takes a surprisingly long time to iterate things sometimes.   I basically agree with the Apple guy in the video that Car Play *looks* better, but no matter where you use Siri right now, she is so *terrible* at making guesses about stuff.  I tried to call a restaurant while driving the other day and even though it's in my address book, Siri took it upon herself to call someplace 500 miles away in freaking Denver, CO instead. And that's basically what was shown in the video—that Google can correctly parse things about twice as rationally as Siri can right now.	hvyboots	t1_dfityph
t3_61zs44	t1_dfj7z57	1490739743	It's not just that Google likes releasing half finished products, they like releasing half finished products and then never updating/canning them when they lose interest. I don't think Apple is quite as guilty of this, but Siri is a fair example in my opinion.	TheWhiteNightmare	t1_dfix3fr
t3_61zs44	t1_dfj910n	1490741047	&gt; nothing you say is going to make it better  You're spot on with that. They covered everything from their flawed testing, improper setup, uncontrolled environmental factors and sub par equipment.   &gt; you offended him by having a different opinion  No, they "offended" me by being bias towards Android Auto, and not performing the tests properly (see above). Then they proceeded to post this nonsense and pretend like it's fact, going so far as to say in their youtube comments that they "cannot wait for all the Apple user's tears", and pinning it. If that's not bias then I don't know what is.	L33tMasta	t1_dfj6y1h

t3_61zs44	t1_dfjagv3	1490742883	&gt; real world comparison  Here let me translate that for you:   Poorly Performed and Biased Comparison  External stimuli in an uncontrolled environment basically nullified anything they thought they found, but **especially** outside noise and other uncontrolled factors that gave the Android Auto an unfair advantage. Who knows if the wind outside the vehicle was blowing harder during one test vs the other, if a large vehicle was passing by, or any number of other sounds from the cityscape were causing more external noise during one test vs the other?  There's a reason this shit is done in a controlled environment by the pros.	L33tMasta	t1_dfja8et

Yeah, maybe but who cares when the whole damn point is to never look at it and just give accurate voice commands while driving and looking at the road.   That said, I think half of that video boils down to how they "train" the voice recognition. My Siri rarely ever makes mistakes.	drinkit_or_wearit	t3_61zs44
t3_61yr8n	t1_dfje7rx	1490747631	I'm on an iPad Mini 2 with the latest iOS and it's fine. My son is still using my iPhone 4s and while it is understandably slow it's still functional.

t3_61zs44	t1_dfjg4yc	1490749995	No problem. You seem like a cool dude, but your buddy is a chode ass Android loving pile of shit based on his comments.   When you give Siri the command, simply tap on the name and you can type it in to correct her. I believe this is how you can correct her pronounciation. But I just put "Jakub W" in my phone with a fake number, says "Call Jakub (Yak-oob) W" and she picked it up first time.   Like I mentioned before, I think you guys had some extreme distortion or outside noise during the Apple CarPlay section that would have caused an issue with her hearing properly. That's the only time I ever have an issue with CarPlay not picking up my commands properly. Granted I drive an old ass Oldsmobile Alero with shitty, degraded weather proofing, an old engine belt that I should probably replace, and the heat/fans turned up to max because I hate being cold.

t3_61zs44	t1_dfji5af	1490752451	My Pioneer AVH-4000NEX came with a directional microphone that I have placed on the roof, directly centre, pointed at the driver's seat.   &gt; Because normal people use Carply and Android Auto with directional microphone  When your equipment isn't low end stock trash, yes.   &gt; outside noise  If you're going to test outside noise you need a standardized way of doing it. Parking in some random ass street is not the correct way to do this. Doing it in a garage, with the same sounds playing outside of the vehicle, would be the correct way of doing it. That way both systems are exposed to the exact same conditions.	L33tMasta	t1_dfjhy6i
t3_61zs44	t1_dfji5g3	1490752457	Came to say the same thing. If someone believes Siri is better than googles voice services they've never used google. And I'm a huge fan of my iPhone.	oDiscordia19	t1_dfixnei
t3_61zs44	t1_dfjib1a	1490752644	A standardized test that allows equal "real world" conditions be applied to both systems. Again, the example of having the vehicle in a garage with the same soundtrack of noise playing outside of the vehicle, at the same volume, to simulate traffic or construction, or whatever you want to play.

t3_61zs44	t1_dfjxyel	1490785131	Why would you test it in a garage? When you're using Apple Carplay, you're driving, not sitting in a garage. That makes no sense at all. You test it in the conditions that it will be used.    Regardless, Android Auto never had a problem, so that point is moot anyway.	PLS-HELP-ME-ASCEND	t1_dfj6naz
t3_61zs44	t1_dfjy1pw	1490785373	Lol Apple really means a lot to you, doesn't it? You've built your personality upon being an Apple fan, and you get offended when someone criticises them, no matter how valid it is. That's sad, mate.	PLS-HELP-ME-ASCEND	t1_dfjg4yc
t3_61zs44	t1_dfjytk2	1490787235	&gt; Redditor for 6 days  If I wanted advice from a newbie, I'd ask for it. And since you posted 2 comments I'll quote them both here for ease of reading:  &gt; Apple really means a lot to you, doesn't it? Blah blah blah I don't know what I'm talking about blah blah blah That's sad, mate.  When the criticism is valid, I'll acknowledge it as such. This is just garbage clickbait nonsense that got spammed all over /r/Apple and /r/iPhone. The mods over at /r/Apple agree, the user in question posts almost exclusively their own videos and according to the Reddit FAQ that constitutes spam.   &gt; Why would you test it in a garage? When you're using Apple Carplay, you're driving, not sitting in a garage. That makes no sense at all. You test it in the conditions that it will be used.  Wrong. You test it in a controlled environment with exact equal stimuli that simulates real world conditions. That way you ensure a fair and accurate test case, otherwise who knows if a large truck was going by during the CarPlay test vs Android Auto, if the wind picked up and was causing additional noise, maybe a car honking in the background, etc. This is anecdotal at best, and far from a true and accurate test.  &gt; Regardless, Android Auto never had a problem, so that point is moot anyway.  Haha yea. It's easy to fake a bias test for clickbate subs. This is why this shit is done in controlled environments by reputable reviewers, not "Yacub and yuri" in their mom's Hyundai on a street corner.	L33tMasta	t1_dfjy1pw

t3_61zs44	t1_dfjzm6s	1490788925	Lol so just because it doesn't work as you wanted it to, it's fake!? That's hilarious. The video was made in the same conditions that you'd use it for in real life. They weren't trying to scientifically prove anything. They just wanted to test in real conditions, and unfortunately for you, Android won.	PLS-HELP-ME-ASCEND	t1_dfjytk2
t3_6260it	t1_dfjzmjt	1490788945	I also just switched to a 7 Plus from a Pixel XL and though I love the 7 Plus, the camera is definitely not as impressive as the Pixel XL's was. Mainly in low light situations, the Pixel's camera basically blows the iPhone's away.	BabysGotTheBends	t3_6260it

t3_61zs44	t1_dfjzzi9	1490789661	&gt; because it doesn't work as you wanted it to, it's fake!?  No. The test was done in an innacurate manner that was designed to give a bias towards one (Android Auto) vs the other (CarPlay).   &gt; they weren't trying to scientifically prove anything  Ah, yes. So sloppy testing conditions that favour one vendor over the other are just the norm these days, I guess. Who cares about equal and fair testing?  &gt; Android won  Oh boy! Introducing non-standard names that haven't had their pronunciation correctly input, having uncontrolled external factors, and a biased test platform sure shows the strength of Android Auto! I'm sure all the poor peasants that can't afford the iPhone are just overjoyed at this revelation.   Meanwhile my obviously higher end system that's actually calibrated properly has next to no issues with use. If my deck supported Android Auto, I'd do a proper test myself. I could hack it with unofficial eBay firmware from the AVH-4100NEX, but I don't feel like possibly bricking my deck over a feature that I'll never use.	L33tMasta	t1_dfjzm6s
t3_61zs44	t1_dfk1195	1490791525	Hahahaha you're hilarious. I can't believe how stressed this has made you. You're literally offended at the results. You're a walking stereotype.	PLS-HELP-ME-ASCEND	t1_dfjzzi9
t3_6260it	t1_dfk1ema	1490792130	In low light situations turn off live photos and do not use the 2x zoom option.	v8xd	t3_6260it
t3_6260it	t1_dfk1giy	1490792216	Oh wait, live photos affect low light photo quality?? I'm going to need to try that, because that's mainly my only complaint about the 7 Plus.	BabysGotTheBends	t1_dfk1ema
t3_6260it	t1_dfk227b	1490793154	Aside from the low light (had a note 7 and that was really good in low light) I am pretty happy with the camera.	taboo007	t3_6260it

t3_6260it	t1_dfk2fzw	1490793720	I'm coming from a Nexus6P and feel that camera was better as well. I've been using the depth effect feature and feel like I'm not getting as great of detail as is advertised.	aredeeeff	t3_6260it
t3_6260it	t1_dfk2os0	1490794063	Yes, that's a bit saddening really. I was talking about the low light situations mainly. Pixel was the only mobile phone I had where I really didn't think I would need to carry a camera, the quality was close with them cheap P&amp;S cameras, and that's saying something for a mobile camera. Yes it was that HDR+ mode mainly but who cares as long as the photos had incredible light in them with details. And the exposure and dynamic range for daytime shots were much better on the Pixel as well!	ithehappy	t1_dfjzmjt
t3_61yr8n	t1_dfk3i4f	1490795171	It's core functionality. 99% of iPhone users at least receive a text of a photo, or sync music, or load a website. An iPhone is a little computer, and the computer just got faster.	MisterFizzster	t1_dfjzoq4
t3_61zs44	t1_dfk458u	1490795997	Yep. Non-standard biased garbage like this sure has made me "stressed".  What actually has me offended is the fact that someone has passed this nonsense off as fact. Unsurprisingly, people that have no idea what they're talking about (you) believe it.	L33tMasta	t1_dfk1195

t3_6260it	t1_dfk6jef	1490798881	YES. The *watercolor effect* is terrible, so is the Portrait mode, looks really cheesy and fake. Definitely didn't expect this from Apple. My iPhone 4 took clearer photos than the 7 Plus in lowlight/indoor situations. Seriously, the performance is comparable to that of a cheap web cam's.	budzwhiz	t3_6260it

t3_6260it	t1_dfk8n4x	1490801220	Not at all. The camera on the 7+ is amazing. I have several low-light photos taken at night from the top of a hotel that are insane for the amount of detail.	windstrider13	t3_6260it
t3_62724f	t1_dfk9x9y	1490802585	I'm into 3D modeling​ on Blender (software) and just last night I was making an artist render of iPhone 8 and I also left the front free of buttons. Cool if it's true. :)	sensicle	t3_62724f
t3_62724f	t1_dfkb2tk	1490803797	Hopefully not, I know it is common with Android phones but I am not a big fan of the fingerprint sensor being on the back of the phone. Mainly because of case restrictions.	LuredGondola	t3_62724f
t3_62724f	t1_dfkbgn0	1490804193	They just put a hole in the case. It's really not a problem and, once you use it awhile, I think you'll find it's actually more convenient and allows for a cleaner aesthetic on the face of the device.	sensicle	t1_dfkb2tk
t3_62724f	t1_dfkbn26	1490804375	That's literally the most half-assed render of a "leak" I've ever seen. There's no way they're going to make the back of the phone look that ugly with how the camera is	PM_Me_Your_Tabs	t3_62724f
t3_6260it	t1_dfkbsmh	1490804531	I came from a 6P and generally I think the 6P took better photos most of the time but the 7 Plus absolutely takes a lot better videos than the 6P, especially in 4K with the 2nd camera for some killer zoom quality  I think a pretty big reason why also some may be slightly disappointed coming from 6P/Pixel to this is because those devices have sharper screens with AMOLED displays that just really pop and look sharper when viewing back photos on that display compared to say the 7 Plus 1080p IPS panel  Overall though I am happy with the camera, I always boost color saturation by about 20% on every photo and boost sharpness by about 15-20 points in Snapseed and they look pretty great to me after doing these 2 things	DaShata	t3_6260it

t3_628qis	t1_dfklzfv	1490815141	I would say wait for the next iPhone since it is supposedly meant to be a big improvement and I expect it will be since other companies have advanced and we had had the same design for 3 years now.   However, since you have a 4S it would be a really big improvement to get the 7 and I imagine the speed and battery (unless you've replaced it) will be bad by now. If you can survive with the 4S for 6 months then I think it will be worth it, or if not I would still say to wait it out for the next iPhone and maybe get a 5S second hand which is still a reasonable phone and still getting updates, just to last you until September. It would still be a good improvement over the 4S.	canamar	t3_628qis
t3_628qis	t1_dfkm00l	1490815159	I have a 6s that I got a few months before the 7 came out and it's still working fine.	zakphi	t3_628qis
t3_628qis	t1_dfkmlqv	1490815787	The reasoning behind me getting a 7+ is because it'll be on a contract with my mobile provider which also gives the option to upgrade after a year. By then, I'll probably pick up the 8/special edition one anyways.  Plus it means a new phone every year on my birthday :p	m1dday	t1_dfklzfv
t3_628qis	t1_dfkmv6l	1490816061	Ah. In that case if you go with the 7+ now then by the time you can upgrade the 8 will be tried and tested so you can know whether it's a good phone. Coming from the 4S though you will love the 7+ I imagine, once you're used to the bigger screen.	canamar	t1_dfkmlqv

t3_628qis	t1_dfko0j3	1490817273	That's exactly my thinking. I'm a bit skeptical about getting it on release given how shaky the rumours sound. And I've tried it in store, I love the big screen. I keep thinking that particular Zoolander quote now when holding my 4S haha	m1dday	t1_dfkmv6l
t3_628qis	t1_dfkow59	1490818203	Haha I'm sure you'll love whatever upgrade you get.	canamar	t1_dfko0j3
t3_628qis	t1_dfkp9w8	1490818614	Cheaper than a 7, still great value in the phone itself. I've had mine for two years and the I really only want to upgrade to get the red 7+. The phone still works brilliantly everyday	Pollo_Bueno	t1_dfknqxf

The implication is that once the indexing is complete battery life will go back to normal, or it will improve. Is anyone seeing that, the improvement, going back to normal?

t3_62851q	t1_dfllktu	1490873084	I think you're right. However, adding a bunch of emojis when other much more important things don't seem to be getting much attention at all *looks* bad. At least it does to me. For just one example: Seeing Siri almost sit still while three competitors come out of thin air and blast past her in functionality and accuracy is disturbing. It becomes more disturbing when I see what Apple *has* been working on (stupid emojis and stickers).    Yeah, I realize one is more difficult than the other. I realize its not the same staff doing the same things. All the same, it just adds to the sense that Apple is taking it a little too easy. It's like the president playing golf while there's a war on. He might be discussing strategy with a general on the 18th hole, but the optics are bad to say the least.	Fendahl_core	t1_dflihr6
t3_62851q	t1_dfllv2i	1490873733	It never went away. Apple just safe spaced it into a stupid water pistol. Everyone else still sees a proper handgun. Apple also killed off a proposed rifle emoji. A rifle proposed as a part of the emojis in honor of Olympic sports. Yes, shooting is an Olympic sport. In fact, the first gold medal earned by the US in the most recent games was for competitive shooting.    But just think of all the lives Apple saved by denying us proper gun emojis. Besides, we have so many other more useful emojis. Like 7 different emojis that represent a notebook or a square icon that says "abcd" in it. I used that one a lot.	Fendahl_core	t1_dfkxip4

Sometimes I really hate the fact that silicon valley is in California, the cesspool of extremist full retard SJW politically correct delusion.

I don't appreciate having the politics of companies or celebrities pushed in my face. Trust me it is political. There was a whole movement that gathered signatures to "disarm the iPhone". I wonder how they'd feel if a Christian evangelical group petitioned Apple to get rid of the dozen or so same-sex marriage related emojis. Not that Apple would entertain that for a second (nor should they).  The point is they bent to politically correct bullshit and altered the meaning of one of the few emojis that's actually somewhat useful.	Fendahl_core	t1_dflmx3r

t3_62851q	t1_dflng98	1490876889	It's the fact that Apple bent to pressure from activist types that bothers me. They wouldn't have removed the gay couple emojis if someone sent them a bunch of signatures. But a bunch of crybabies whine about the gun and *poof* now it's a safe space approved water pistol. A water pistol doesn't convey the same meaning. Not even remotely. They might as well have deleted it entirely. Apple also cockblocked the entire Unicode consortium from adding a rifle emoji. It was to be a part of the emojis celebrating Olympic events. But no, we can't have that. What if someone robbed a bank or shot up a school with an emoji?  Oh wait that's right. It's just an emoji. Well nevermind. Let's censor that because it hurt someone's feelings and we all need to do our part to make guns socially unacceptable. Why not start with emojis right?    I'm sure I sound paranoid to the non-gun owners hahaha, but these were not random decisions. They are 100% politically motivated and that makes me sad.	Fendahl_core	t1_dflmu24

t3_62851q	t1_dfmquo7	1490922623	It's just promoting violence. Maybe a group of 8 years old send them a bunch to each other, desensitizing themselves to guns because it's just a silly emoji. Then they play with their dads gums and one gets accidentally shot.  I really think they took it out because it promotes violence. But idk they still have the bomb in there. Maybe they kept that in because people use bomb as a slang.	_Ballin	t1_dfmqntm
t3_62851q	t1_dfms7wh	1490924396	I don't think it had anything to do with that. Emojis aren't real. An emoji of a sandwich will not satisfy your hunger and an emoji of a gun can't hurt anyone.   The real reason is more insidious IMO because it's political. I get that the tech industry and Apple especially are extremely, overwhelmingly, fawningly liberal. It's unavoidable. Thats fine. But I *really* resent it when a company or a celebrity tries to push their political views and opinions of how culture *should* be.    It's just one of my pet peeves. I think it's not their place. I think it smacks of arrogance. Your job is to make phones. Period. Not to try and influence society and culture. The only exception to me is if it is something completely *apolitical*. Like raising money for kids with cancer. You want to tackle that? Have at it. But the gun emoji thing is part of a wider effort afoot among gun control ninnies who are determined to make guns and shooting as a sport and hobby socially unacceptable and "ew gross". I'm not imagining it. Trust me. So yeah, I resent Apple's meddling. I also don't appreciate Tim Cook using Apple as his personal platform to promote LGBT shit. Now, I am not a homophobe. I have no issue with homosexuality, people are clearly born gay and deserve the same rights as anyone else. But I don't need that rammed down my throat with 25 gay themed emojis, ok? Just not necessary and yet another reminder that you can't find hardly any place in the world where you can simple be and do something without having some controversial political shitty influence in your face. It's growing quite tiresome.	Fendahl_core	t1_dfmoq3e

t3_62iwcz	t1_dfmzc5e	1490934765	Apple wants to push the bill for making wireless everything. Right now it's headphones, and by sticking to a no headphone port design it should theoretically force the manufacturers of high-fi monitors and such to go the cordless route. Beyond wireless for headphones, I think they'll find various ways to implement accessories that just "magically" connect. Anywho, I feel that if Apple feels so strongly about a wireless future, then their best bet is to stick to it and not budge. They could easily re-introduce the headphone port by releasing two different phones this fall. Say, an IPhone edition, where it has all the fancy new things and a complete redesign. And then maybe an iPhone 7s or just "New iPhone" where it incorporates that headphone port like its 6-series predecessor.	alway5inf1n1t3	t3_62iwcz

t3_62il5e	t1_dfmzjc7	1490935118	Sprint requires the phone IMEI + the SIM card ICCID. Idiotic, but they don't use a SIM Card system.	OptionalCookie	t1_dfmyfc1
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfmzjoc	1490935134	They're bound to implement it within the next big device. But they like to release just a handful of new physical features. Otherwise too many would mean that average joe just doesn't notice something gets announced. And by waiting they get to slowly roll out new features, ensuring that each work seamlessly with the next. I mean I would love to have wireless charging capabilities with my phone. But I can see why it's not here yet.	alway5inf1n1t3	t3_62iwcz

t3_62iwcz	t1_dfniz47	1490974096	I haven't had an iPhone for years, so I'm far from being an Apple fanboy.  During that time, I did use the headphone jack on my Android phones...until I got Bluetooth headphones.  To me, the 3.5mm jack is like the IR blaster...seems nice to have until I realize I never use it.	bellnghmrider	t1_dfnaaar

t3_62iwcz	t1_dfnne4t	1490978929	So you're saying it should be removed because some people have no need for it?	MoneyForNothing_	t1_dfnatsu
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnnhgm	1490979030	I have small hands and I own the 5S which I think is the perfect size. If your mom thinks the 6 is too big you might want to look at getting her the [SE](https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/) which is what I will get when it's time for me to switch and a price for a new SE is about $300.	halfdone	t3_62ma4s
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnnm6o	1490979177	Yeah I looked at the SE but she does like to read alot on her phone (that's all she really does, she's not tech savvy so as long as she can call text, take a picture, and read her books).  I used mobile device size compare website to show her the difference between her phone and the SE/6.   The 6s was around 350$ which I would dish out but...Honestly the differences don't make it worth it IMO. I think...I may be wrong as I've been using Android since the iPhone 4 so I'm a bit outside the loop of things.	Smooth_guy	t1_dfnnhgm
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnnsfz	1490979367	True, a bigger screen for what she likes to do is the advantage when comparing the two.	halfdone	t1_dfnnm6o
t3_62km6q	t1_dfnny3w	1490979537	Initially mine was worse on my 6S, Now I don't notice any difference.	davetheninja81	t3_62km6q
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnny3q	1490979537	She's hard to please. She wants one handed use...But she wants a bigger screen. For comparison she can't one hand a 5.2" phone but I can one hand a 6" Nexus 6 or 6p lol. Hell I could swallow the SE whole probably....	Smooth_guy	t1_dfnnsfz
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfnnzi8	1490979579	Not nearly the same. Having to remember to leave bluetooth on, then the headphones, and having them charged. Wired is just plug and play.	MoneyForNothing_	t1_dfnn5tu
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfnodaq	1490979998	Remember to leave Bluetooth on?  Just leave it on.  I put my headphones on, hit the power button, they connect to my phone automatically within three seconds.  Where's the hassle in that?  It's all perspective.  To me, the hassle is having a wire running from my head to my device.	bellnghmrider	t1_dfnnzi8
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfnozxu	1490980680	It is all perspective. I don't like having too many icons in the statusbar so I turn it off just like I do for the alarm when i don't need it and keep battery percentage off. I have bluetooth headphones myself and the main hassle is keeping them charged.	MoneyForNothing_	t1_dfnodaq
t3_62km6q	t1_dfnpkn6	1490981308	I made a post asking about this problem and got ridiculed by a few people.  After one of the last few updates my 6 only lasts about 3 hours. I just went on vacation and it would only last about an hour if I used my GPS for an average of 20 min.  I don't want to swap my battery out because a few people have told me that may not be the fix.	TardisBlu	t1_dfnj0p3
t3_5k0gxl	t1_dfnpktk	1490981313	Guys just an update for whoever comes searching for the same issue.   It's been a while now and my phone still functions perfectly!	hardtalk370	t3_5k0gxl
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnpmaw	1490981357	For T-Mobile the iPhone 6 lacks Band 12 which makes a huge difference in coverage of T-Mobile has it deployed in your market. I would recommend the SE or the 6S if you're planning on using it with T-Mobile.	mitchdean	t3_62ma4s
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnpxef	1490981700	Well the issue is band 12 isn't anywhere near me...It's rolling out in major cities but out here in South Carolina it's not really gonna do much because it's not here "yet".	Smooth_guy	t1_dfnpmaw
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnq07b	1490981787	Yeah from what I've read T-Mobile doesn't own any Band 12 in SC so I guess it's a matter of whether or not you travel much and would want it for when/if you're outside of SC.	mitchdean	t1_dfnpxef
t3_62km6q	t1_dfnq19r	1490981820	That's elapsed time correct, not remaining? If so that's pretty good.  Sorry im switching from android to iOS and haven't looked at iOS battery status screens since iOS8...	De_Vermis_Mysteriis	t1_dfnnp8l
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfnq7f0	1490982008	No one has a "need" for it; it's your choice if you opt to use old technology.	Rkziki	t1_dfnne4t
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnqebn	1490982221	Ah okay.   I heard they have gotten SOME 700mhz liscenced around here but that was about 6 months ago and I haven't really heard then actually putting it up or anything.  I looked at the map and there are a dozen towers In Georgia but that's as close as band 12 has gotten to us here in poor SC...We are still on friggin DSL.  Speaking of Internet, it supports wifi calling right?	Smooth_guy	t1_dfnq07b
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnqgv6	1490982299	Yes the iPhone 6,6S, and SE all support WiFi calling	mitchdean	t1_dfnqebn
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnqixu	1490982362	Does it work reliably? I had one phone that it was like 50/50 sometimes it said it was on but wouldn't work...But my nexus 6p/5x work like magic. (Or apple just works regardless :D?)	Smooth_guy	t1_dfnqgv6
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnqnrl	1490982508	In my experience with an iPhone 6 and 6S Plus on T-Mobile the wifi calling has always worked flawlessly but since you mentioned DSL that may cause issues depending on your bandwidth and the quality of your line.	mitchdean	t1_dfnqixu
t3_62km6q	t1_dfnqnwi	1490982513	yeah that's elapsed time.  iOS does not show remaining time. (as far as i know)	ragdelwolf	t1_dfnq19r
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnqr79	1490982615	I have 6mb down and 1.5mb up. It works with my Nexus devices :/ so as long as it can actually connect (example the htc one M9 cant connect sometimes but say it's there or vice versa).	Smooth_guy	t1_dfnqnrl
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnqv0l	1490982728	If it works fine with your nexus devices it's safe to assume it will work fine with iPhones.	mitchdean	t1_dfnqr79
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnr1s4	1490982936	Gotcha. Thanks for the info! Hope my mother can learn how to use it although she's gotten really good at actually googling "how to" lately.	Smooth_guy	t1_dfnqv0l
t3_62ma4s	t1_dfnrc27	1490983244	No problem, my mom has a 6+ and she loves it btw I'm sure iPhone will be easy for her to pick up.	mitchdean	t1_dfnr1s4
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfnt8z6	1490985348	Remember the HTC Dream AKA the G1? Proprietary headphones or Bluetooth were your only options. And people just accepted it without a second thought.	ghrayfahx	t1_dfnaaar

t3_62iwcz	t1_dfnw5fn	1490988550	Do NOT buy those overpriced earbuds... they're the same quality but way more expensive. Why do you want them?	SemiPureConduit	t1_dfmz9qr
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfnx13a	1490989532	For the same reason I want anything, I just do.  But to give a real answer:  sometimes I don't want to wear big earmuff headphones; the Jabra set doesn't fit in my ear as snugly as I would prefer; the Jabra set are connected by a wire that catches and pulls on my sweatshirt collar when I work out; it is said the AirPods fit exactly the same as the wired buds which come with the phone, and those are the best fitting earbuds I've ever used; I hate wires; I like new tech.	bellnghmrider	t1_dfnw5fn
t3_62km6q	t1_dfnx7f9	1490989722	AFAIK iOS "usage" is unreliable as a measure of actual usage. When the phone is working, it'll report that it's being used - even if the screen is on.	KaonPlus	t1_dfnv3fi
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfnxel2	1490989939	So your willing to pay $160 for average sounding headphones that you have to charge?	SemiPureConduit	t1_dfnx13a
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfnxv7i	1490990453	Yup.  1) "Average sounding" is opinion.  2) Plugging something into an outlet isn't physically exerting.  3) $160 is a good price for a quality product...which explains why we have iPhones and not ZTEs with 8GB of storage and 1GB of RAM.    If I don't like them, I will return them.  But they look to be exactly what I want in a set of earbuds.	bellnghmrider	t1_dfnxel2

t3_62km6q	t1_dfnza9l	1490992106	Yea, best thing to do is just take your phone off the charger and don't plug it in for 24 hours. Then check the screen on time which i am not sure why people don't include in these screenshots.	accountforrunning	t1_dfnx7f9

t3_62km6q	t1_dfo6vg5	1491001803	I had this exact issue with my 6 as well. After upgrading to iOS 10 I started having a lot of battery issues with my phone shutting down at random battery percentages and then shooting up to 80-90% when I plugged it in, only to "die" an hour or so later. I called Apple and they ran a diagnostic test. They said the battery needed to be replaced. I went on vacation about 2 weeks later and a charge was barely lasting 3 hours. I had the battery replaced while on vacation (got lucky and the battery place that did it for me had everything iphone on clearance because of Apple's cease and desist on unauthorized repairs). It fixed the problem immediately.  I upgraded to the 7 a few months ago and haven't had any issues. Yet.	likejackandsally	t1_dfnpkn6

t3_62pr8z	t1_dfoga05	1491015107	Call it nostalgia, but nothing will beat the hype for me than the 4s. I rocked that phone until it was beaten and cracked.   For the sake of innovation and release, I don't think we'll have another phone release quite like that one.	paligror	t3_62pr8z
t3_62pr8z	t1_dfogc9v	1491015206	I had the iPhone 4 and I couldn't agree more until around 2015 when I noticed it was so as fuck compared to other phones so I upgraded to android decided I'd rather have an iPhone 6s and I've been loving my rose gold beauty ever since.	ktmkole9	t1_dfoga05

t3_62pwxz	t1_dfogj3u	1491015506	Well put it this way. I'm relatively new to the iOS ecosystem. Got my first (personal) iPhone shortly after the release of the 7. The most I've spent on a single app so far is $10. That was a half price special on an app that normally sells for $20. I've bought one other app that was $10 also. Most of the others have been between $0.99 and $5.	cajunman4life	t1_dfogd3y

t3_62pr8z	t1_dfoqv74	1491038523	My first and only iPhone is the 7 plus.   I really love it.     However, I like the "Classic" look an awful lot too; esp. the 5s, Which is carried on in the iPhone SE.  In terms of prettiness of the design, those phones are stellar.    But the big screen and big battery of the Plus makes it the obvious winner.	Raudskeggr	t3_62pr8z
t3_62km6q	t1_dfoqy74	1491038799	I no longer see a %age breakdown by app in the battery menu like you do  I'm on a 6 as well.  I believe it went away after I updated BEFORE 10.3 was that 10.2.10? Anyone else experience this? I sure miss it	somedirection	t3_62km6q

t3_62pr8z	t1_dfotfdh	1491046833	Def nostalgia. The 4s was just a spec-bumped iPhone 4 + Siri.	_bearly	t1_dfoga05
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfotjum	1491047180	That's the dumbest comment.   How do you think the wireless charging is supposed to work? Simply put the phone next to power outlet and the phone would start charging?  Look at the word WIRELESS. when there is no wire to charge the phone, it's wireless charging.	nayabkl	t1_dfos8i8
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfotqfb	1491047685	How is it truly wireless when your still physically connected to something? Yet your calling me dumb 😴  You can't use your phone while it's on the charging pad, your better off using a cable ffs 😂 thick prick	rollsie7	t1_dfotjum
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfou0w9	1491048437	Unless you reinvent the law of electromagnetic, what you are defining as "true" wireless charging cannot be accomplished.  It doesn't matter what you perceive as true wireless charging, but to majority of people, what is available today is considered wireless.	nayabkl	t1_dfotqfb
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfou26h	1491048526	It really isn't though is it. Until you can walk into a room and your phone starts charging it will never be wireless	rollsie7	t1_dfou0w9
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfou4lk	1491048696	Fine, if you want to get technical, let's use the term cableless charging. How come Apple doesn't have cableless charging when other premium phones all have it?	nayabkl	t1_dfou26h
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfou6op	1491048841	Because they have metal backed phones. Until they switch back to glass it's not gonna happen. Seriously though it's not really that big of a deal, would rather have fast charging instead. Something on the level of OnePlus Dash Charge	rollsie7	t1_dfou4lk
t3_62pr8z	t1_dfouxtu	1491050622	My favourite is the 4S, followed by the 6S. My least favourite is the 5C. I hated it when I had it.	itsmegeorge	t3_62pr8z
t3_62oig1	t1_dfow16e	1491052921	IMHO, it is. The natural language input and the widget are amazing. Simple to add both todo's and events.	SiGamma	t1_dfoqj1b
t3_62oig1	t1_dfow36j	1491053029	Hmm probably natural language is not supported in my country (Poland)   What I'm still not getting is why the hell Google Calendar doesntt have a widget yet?	alus992	t1_dfow16e
t3_62oig1	t1_dfow5i9	1491053148	Technically, mine isn't either (Croatia), but I just name the events in Croatian and type the date and time stuff in English, f.e "Ručak tomorrow from 12-14". Works without issues.	SiGamma	t1_dfow36j
t3_62oig1	t1_dfowa1o	1491053393	Sure it's gonna work but I use calendar with my co-workers and they are not gonna do it and they are not gonna read stuff in English unfortunately.	alus992	t1_dfow5i9
t3_62km6q	t1_dfown16	1491054081	Yeah the bottom number is how long the phone has been off the charger after a full charge and the top number is "usage time" which is kind of like screen on time on Android, but not really.	PavelDatsyuk	t1_dfnq19r
t3_62km6q	t1_dfowqj0	1491054263	&gt; won't let apple update my phone to obsolescence.  The SE is like a year and some change old. It's got the power of the 6S. It's not going to be obsolete any time soon, so update away if you want.	PavelDatsyuk	t1_dfnevnh
t3_62km6q	t1_dfox0wt	1491054788	Apparently not if they're getting 9 hours usage and 15 standby.	PavelDatsyuk	t1_dfo0z4z
t3_62oig1	t1_dfoxb0q	1491055289	What I'm saying is, it won't be in English. For the example that I gave, everyone that I share my calendar with would just see "Ručak" and not the second part, put in the timetable where it belongs, in whichever language they use.   It's just like selecting time and date via a menu, but with words. Those words have to be in English for Fantastical to recognize them, but no one actually sees those words besides the app.	SiGamma	t1_dfowa1o
t3_62oig1	t1_dfoxg2z	1491055535	That's why I would love Apple to introduce trails...	alus992	t1_dfoxb0q
t3_62oig1	t1_dfoyjv1	1491057372	Really not seeing the draw to ToDoist, I tried it out and it's like an expensive Reminders app with more inconvenient functionality.	doug	t3_62oig1
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfp1ln4	1491061905	Average sounding is not an opinion, I guess that was said in many professional reviews out there (except the apple-fan ones)	Elvecio	t1_dfnxv7i
t3_62oig1	t1_dfp32zv	1491063979	I have Fantastical and while I realize I'm in the minority, I didn't really care for it. I liked Google calendar OK, but ended up going back to the stock calendar app. I like that the app icon always has the day number on it and the stock app just works best for my needs. I found Google calendar frustrating to input information.	Wdc331	t1_dfoqj1b
t3_62oig1	t1_dfp36tz	1491064133	I use ToDoist and LOVE it. It's one of those apps that appears really simple but is feature-packed.   Reasons I like it include:  - It works across multiple platforms, incluing the Web (something I need because I spend most of my day on a PC and have a mac and iphone for personal use)  - Clean interface  - Natural language input  - Ability to make sub and sub-sub tasks, which is wonderful for project management  - The inbox and ability to use the GTD approach.   - Use of filters and labels  - IFTTT support   - Integration with Trello via IFTTT	Wdc331	t1_dfoyjv1
t3_62pwxz	t1_dfp422u	1491065385	Android may have more free apps, but you'll find the top choices across various categories are developed for both iOS and Android anyway, with developers charging the same across both platforms.   The apps I bought on Android I could buy on iOS. The free apps I had on Android were free on iOS and both had IAPs for removing ads and such. Anecdotal, but you'll more than likely find yourself in the same boat. Your spending habits really shouldn't change.	PixelBurst	t3_62pwxz
t3_62iwcz	t1_dfp5xzp	1491068096	Yeah, I take the Apple fan reviews with a grain of salt.  Apple could shit in a box and call it art and the fans would rave over it.	bellnghmrider	t1_dfp1ln4

t3_62oig1	t1_dfp7hvr	1491070359	At first it feels like a "so-so" to do app, but the little things are what I like, for example the unlimited nesting of sub-tasks and projects is very helpful and the cross-platform functionality. I just use the free version, its more than enough and for time specific reminders I'll just use the iCloud reminders.	Hallow201	t1_dfoyjv1
t3_62oig1	t1_dfp7j4w	1491070409	Agree it's a great app. At first I really didn't like it until I spent a bit of time looking at the features. The sub-tasks and sun-projects are a very nice feature.	Hallow201	t1_dfp36tz
t3_62udk2	t1_dfp98wr	1491072900	Yes. It's my trade off for not using a case.	BeastlyPokemonCard	t3_62udk2

t3_62udk2	t1_dfpcxv5	1491078468	I don't. I pay for insurance on my phone, so if the screen cracks, I can just make a process through my insurance for a repair/replacement.  I feel that screen shields are hit or miss and aren't worth the $40-50 they originally cost.	highflyflow	t3_62udk2
t3_62udk2	t1_dfpd9vc	1491078973	Yes and it saved my screen from cracking when the phone fell.... it cracked the tempered glass but not my screen.	md28usmc	t3_62udk2

For laptops, space is less of a problem, so an extra chip or two is not a huge deal. And because charging 2-5% of a completely dead laptop battery can take 15-20 minutes, they can boot off of a power adapter alone.  &amp;nbsp;  (side note: to start electronics that can't boot from a power adapter alone, 2-5% of the battery must be charged.)	samtheboo	t3_63a19v

This may be simply to compensate for clock speed increases so you don't see a massive increase in charge times as you use the phone.

A benefit of this is that you can use shitty quality power (non perfect sine wave, intermittent, not exactly the right voltage or amps) and the battery will still provide exactly what your phone needs, like a little scrubber :)	Thebandroid	t3_63a19v

t3_63a19v	t1_dft5ezd	1491300078	The only way to confirm is at the specific model level.  The test is to remove the battery, plug the cord in and see if it powers up. If it does, the device (laptop, phone, etc.) is completely bypassed when the battery is charged. Most enterprise laptops are this way.  Most cheap laptops no longer are.  For those devices that stop charging but still need the battery insert to power on, they have an internal bypass. The power doesn't go through the actual battery cells. The switch happens quick enough that the system doesn't care.	stromm	t3_63a19v

t3_63cgnp	t1_dft7juk	1491305780	Haha, we must be commute clones, man. I listen to a lot of roleplaying discussion/AP podcasts, because I'm a huge tabletop rpg fan/nerd.  I sometimes listen to Stuff You Should Know, Lore, The Message/LifeAfter, Tall Tales and Travel, and Improvised Star Trek, though with varying frequency.  My GF just told me about a podcast called, like... Sword and Scale, I believe, that's kind of a discussion-oriented FRONTLINE as far as I can tell from her description. She came home almost in tears the other day because they had a really in-depth discussion about the realities of human-, and specifically child-, sex-trafficking and ways to combat it.	theblackveil	t1_dft7dtn
t3_63cgnp	t1_dft7ma7	1491305930	That's interesting! I listen to stuff you should know, mo money, the minimalist, star talk, and unexplained. I find it better to occupy my time listening to podcast rather than to listening to crappy music on the radio.	Always_BSI	t1_dft7juk

t3_63cgnp	t1_dft7ous	1491306084	Totally agree, my man.  If you haven't listened to The Message / LifeAfter, I cannot recommend them strongly enough.  Just make sure you start with The Message, episode 1 and move forward as you have time. The episodes are short enough that you'll wind up rapidly devouring by the midway point, most likely.	theblackveil	t1_dft7ma7

The Belkin Grip Candy Sheer is another favorite from my iPhone 5 days.  You also might want to check out your local Marshall's/TJMaxx because they sometimes sell old stock of cases and $5.99-$7.99 seems to be the sweet spot for the 5/5S/SE ones.	ecs0013	t3_63gj1s

The biggest thing, from the times I tried to make the switch, were the painful lack of iMessage and how terrible most of the apps are on the Play Store.

t3_63ot79	t1_dfw0f06	1491439569	I personally would. I've never owned an Android phone in my entire life, so it's be an interesting switch. I also demoed the S8 at my local Target and I've got to say, I'm very impressed. It's making me more excited to upgrade.	lordpotatoofpotatoes	t3_63ot79

t3_63qdke	t1_dfwnnrz	1491484245	Here from r\all and have android, but i thought it was funny when i was talking about google assistant and it kept opening, i told it to fuck off and it replied "sorry you feel that way, i can help send an error report if you'd like"	wickidclown17	t3_63qdke
t3_63ri42	t1_dfwno94	1491484264	You can change icons now in 10.3, but it has to be done by the developer. So far the biggest uses have been the MLB at bat and NHL apps. You can choose a team logo under settings.	TrizzaElemental	t1_dfwk155
t3_63qdke	t1_dfwoitp	1491485452	Now, I know Siri gets lots of flak... but it's impressive that she did manage to pull the important part of that command out and just ignore the rest. She could have said "sorry, I don't understand".	slick_licks_dicks	t3_63qdke
t3_63ri42	t1_dfworz7	1491485797	Is it possible for developers to change the logo based on real-time information? For example, I can imagine a weather app showing the weather condition and temperature as the logo	mrb2011	t1_dfwno94
t3_63ri42	t1_dfwpj2n	1491486775	No. Apple is strict when it comes to changing the icon. It specifically has to be user set and approved for an icon change.	crisss1205	t1_dfworz7
t3_63ri42	t1_dfwprri	1491487084	Ah, that's a shame. It would've been cool to have that!  Thanks for answering	mrb2011	t1_dfwpj2n
t3_63iehf	t1_dfwps4x	1491487096	Thanks, guess I misread/-judged your original comment because of the way you phrased it.	imaslinky	t1_dfvomun
t3_63ri42	t1_dfwq2ne	1491487457	No. The icons cannot be dynamic and require user input to make the change. Cannot be a background change. This is to avoid apps from changing to fraud icons like a facebook or bank app and asking for your password.	TrizzaElemental	t1_dfworz7
t3_63qdke	t1_dfwqgyv	1491487934	As Siri lives on Apple's server, Siri doesn't care if you rip out the phone's battery. Siri would be glad if you did so, because it means one client less to serve. You see, Siri is so lazy that it never really does anything useful, other than asking that Google (or Bing) dude to search the web for what you asked.	CKowalski	t3_63qdke

t3_63ri42	t1_dfwsqm4	1491490525	Haven't seen anything like that yet, but you can use the Fahrenheit app, which will show the current temperature as a badge alert.  I use it all the time.	montydad5000	t1_dfworz7

t3_63ri42	t1_dfwzcv2	1491497494	It's a security feature. If apps could change icons dynamically then they could easily impersonate other apps for malware purposes.  You can watch this happen soon with the next release of Android (as if it needed any more security issues).	tsdguy	t1_dfwprri
t3_63ri42	t1_dfwze76	1491497531	This is completely different. Apps can change the icon appearance with a preselected and Apple approved list of icons.	tsdguy	t1_dfwsqm4
t3_63ri42	t1_dfwzf7x	1491497560	I don't know pitch. Does this icon change have any functional purpose?	tsdguy	t3_63ri42
t3_63ri42	t1_dfwzhb5	1491497618	I understand that, but the poster above was asking if there was a way to dynamically display the temperature.  While Apple isn't allowing this to be done with the icon, it CAN be done using the badge alert.	montydad5000	t1_dfwze76

t3_63ri42	t1_dfx2se1	1491501007	Weather temp sure but the post also says weather conditions which isn't possible. Even temp with negative numbers is not possible without some gymnastics.   Apps that want to change the badge have to open a dialog box and get approval from the user to change the icon. That wouldn't be feasible for a dynamic situation like weather conditions. It's more for badging.   If the app was allows to make the icon assume any image then malware could easily introduce an icon that looked like someone elses apps.	tsdguy	t1_dfwzhb5

t3_63x6ge	t1_dfy1gmz	1491545682	Unless the company who does the display replacement changes the Touch ID with the new screen, as most would. The only reason they wouldn't is if for whatever reason they damaged the Touch ID ribbon cable. Not all unauthorized display replacements cause Touch ID failure.   *source: do "unauthorized repairs" for a living and have family members who have broken multiple screens on the same device and still have Touch ID functionality on 5S, 6, 6S, and 7.	jakeuten	t1_dfxpr4z

t3_63x6ge	t1_dfylqsr	1491582154	&gt; Will the phone function regularly without? So the rest of my iphone is fine for use then?  Generally, yeah. You won't be able to unlock it with a fingerprint or use Apple Pay.  &gt; will the screen need to be completely replaced again?   Not unless there's something wrong with it preventing normal use or maybe if it has terrible cosmetic issues. The picture looked like maybe it was a less than perfect refurb screen- usable but with a noticeable cosmetic defect. The picture had the screen off, though, so you'll just have to try it and see if it works.	my02	t1_dfyks36
t3_63x6ge	t1_dfymfm9	1491582872	I took these pictures, and the screen is perfect condition other than the minor white defect thing ...   What do you mean the screen is off? I can add more pictures if needed lol	percectTacos	t1_dfylqsr
t3_63x6ge	t1_dfyqtko	1491587482	&gt; What do you mean the screen is off?  Not powered on, or not showing a picture. It's hard to tell if there's anything wrong with it. No worries if it looks to work normally.	my02	t1_dfymfm9
t3_63x6ge	t1_dfyso0v	1491589500	Ohhh i thought you mean the screen was like popped off or something like that.

t3_63x6ge	t1_dfyups1	1491591752	Yeah. That white line looks like a cosmetic defect from being refurbished. It's usually not a problem beyond how it looks.	my02	t1_dfyso0v

t3_63x6ge	t1_dfyz8xy	1491596901	Yes. The fact that TouchID isn't working is a sign that the previous owner did a non-Apple certified screen replacement. The fact that there are also display problems (a white line on the side) means they did a crappy job and when (not if) the display goes faulty, Apple won't be sympathetic.	JToews19	t1_dfyz3nu
t3_63x6ge	t1_dfyzaub	1491596964	Would I just be able to get another screen replacement then if the display went faulty?	percectTacos	t1_dfyz8xy
t3_63x6ge	t1_dfyzd35	1491597039	It will end up costing you a lot more than $280 if their horrible display replacement job craps out on you. Also, I thought you said this was supposed to be new?	JToews19	t1_dfyjnu9
t3_63x6ge	t1_dfyzgfu	1491597149	Maybe. Apple changed their policy just over a month ago so that third-party screen replacements would no longer void your iPhone's warranty, but I would still not risk it. The missing screw and damaged screen are signs of a lack of care that went into its repair. It's obvious why they wanted to sell it.	JToews19	t1_dfyzaub

t3_647kb5	t1_dfzz0wg	1491665460	I recently switched back to IOS after 4 years on Android.  Just got a 7 and sold my Nexus 5x.  You are spot on about Siri and the build quality.  I am impressed at IOS and how it has developed since I last used it.  I miss the way Android handles notifications and I miss the persistent LED notification light.  Other than those two things I am loving it.	theoneandonly78	t3_647kb5
t3_647kb5	t1_dfzzpln	1491666457	Curious, I find Siri to be superior to Google Now and Google Assistant.  With Siri, I can tell her that she pronounces a contact's name incorrectly and dictate the pronunciation to her so that she improves - and she really does. As far as I know this isn't present with Google Now / Assistant. I also find that Siri opens up and performs a function not necessarily faster but much more smoothly than Google Now / Assistant, both of which tend to sort of stutter and freeze a bit from time to time as I ask them to open or switch to another app.  Lastly I've been able to use Siri without error even in incredibly noisy areas, whereas with Google Now / Assistant I find myself having to frequently seek a quieter place to be able to use it conveniently which sort of defeats the point a lot of the time. I don't know if this is down to better voice processing capabilities or the result of better noise filtering (on either the hardware or software side) specific to the iPhone, but either way the end result has been quite a lot better for me.  And funnily enough I'm Scottish, usually a nationality which voice processing technologies tend to have the most difficulty with in English.	DatDeLorean	t3_647kb5
t3_640xw1	t1_dfzztuc	1491666638	It a friend of mine asked me, I sure wouldn't mind. Plus it seems to me like 75%+ of smartphone users already have it.	Acealone9	t1_dfywj69
t3_647kb5	t1_dg00h2q	1491667559	What is your experience with Google Now? As in, how long have you used it for?  If you've used it for a decent time my disappointment with Siri could just be down to having to get the hang of it.	TimothyGonzalez	t1_dfzzpln
t3_647kb5	t1_dg00ogr	1491667848	What about the headphone port? Have you bought bluetooth earphones?	TimothyGonzalez	t1_dfzz0wg
t3_647kb5	t1_dg00pjv	1491667889	I've been using it since I got it on my Note 2 when it was first launched in the U.K., so I'm guessing 3 years or so now. Actually maybe a little more, I can't quite recall.  It could be a matter of needing some adjusting time yeah. For me though it was an instantaneous improvement, as soon as I got my iPhone 7 Plus and begun using Siri I felt much more satisfied in using it.	DatDeLorean	t1_dg00h2q
t3_647kb5	t1_dg00tjh	1491668047	I owned nexus 4 and 5, then switched to iphone 5s and got bored so i switched to nexus 6p and for no reason I switched again to iPhone 6S, used it for a few months before switched to galaxy s6 then note 5 then s7 but now I'm using an iPhone 7. I can safely say iPhones satisfy me more than android flagships because despite beung flagships, they still had hiccups, lags and slowdowns no matter stock or custom roms.	Davcoss	t3_647kb5
t3_647kb5	t1_dg00vj9	1491668125	You could just use the EarPods they come with or the cable it comes with that acts as a headphone port	Cheezewiz239	t1_dg00ogr
t3_647kb5	t1_dg013dy	1491668437	This is exactly how I feel. I'm happy I made the switch but I really hope Siri can improve and that the notification mess get fixed. Why the swipe and then press clear? I also kind of miss having the small icons at the top letting me know which apps have active notifications. I found that to be easier than the red circles with the numbers everywhere.	MacTaggerHK	t1_dfzz0wg

t3_647kb5	t1_dg048np	1491672829	I'm sorry man but your experience is horribly outdated. That phone was released in 2012.   I've been pretty happy with iOS since my switch from Android, but Siri might be the most objective downgrade. Everything else has its own reason and philosophy, but Siri is just worse at the exact same thing.	temba_hisarmswide_	t1_dg00pjv
t3_647kb5	t1_dg04lzc	1491673352	I upgraded from the Note 2. :P  I've also used it extensively on my BlackBerry Priv (Snapdragon 808), my Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, my sister's Huawei P9 for a decent while both during and after setting it up for her... and a few short times with other friends' various devices. I've just never found it to be consistently responsive to me.  Once Google Now/Assistant is actively loaded in memory, it's fairly fine at being responsive. But unlike with Siri, it is not part of the system. It can and does get unloaded from active memory, and as soon as it does it either doesn't respond to "Ok Google" at all or takes a fair while to respond / react. Siri for me is always available and always responds as soon as I call for her or hold the home button. There's never any delay, never any sluggishness in responding.  Google Now/Assistant can be just as fast, sometimes even faster... but it's nowhere near as consistent in my experience, and that makes it unpredictable at best and frustrating at worst.

I also personally prefer google now on my G4 because I can just access it by swiping up the home button on lollipop. Who the hell still uses Siri lol.  The lack of headphone jack doesn't bother me anyway, I'll just use a wireless headphone.	Writtensine6	t3_647kb5

t3_644nmq	t1_dg08rcd	1491679326	Same thing here, except some days it will be worse, some days it will be better. It also depends on what apps I'm using, if I'm on Reddit then the battery percentage rarely goes down. Then if I switch to snapchat or something else that uses the display, camera, audio etc. I watch the battery jump from 74% to 71% (just did this right now). It's almost as if through changing how the iPhone manages power to stop the unexpected shutdowns in 10.2.1 for other devices it messed up the battery measurements for other iPhones too and how much battery the device will use.   That and my battery will be 10/20% less since 10.2.1. Hoping for 10.3.2 to be my saviour!	FuckNope	t3_644nmq

t3_647kb5	t1_dg0ow4b	1491703626	Having only a single port that is used for both charging and headphones is impractical and annoying.    Anyone who makes excuses for this is the worst kind of Apple apologist honestly. The argument that Apple needed the space in the phone is specious. Will people eventually get used to it? Yes, most of us will adapt and deal with it just like we do every time Apple eliminates yet another feature in the pursuit of thinner, lighter devices and fatter and wider profit margins.   If Apple had included wireless charging or AirPods with the phone so that nothing was lost, it would have been forgivable. The way it is, the customer gained exactly nothing. We just *lost* functionality. And Apple probably added another $2-3 in profit on an already obscenely overpriced phon by eliminating a part.  Apple makes great products. I like them. I've been using them for more than 30 years in fact. But I never shrink from criticizing them. I'm a fan, but not a *fan boy*. I don't appreciate it when I feel like Apple is giving us all a bit of a 'fuck you' as they sometimes do. If I'm honest, I miss the days when Apple was hungry and had a little more humility and more creative juice. I am happy to have seem them go from financial distress in the 1990s to becoming the most valuable company in the world. That was a miracle.  But I'm not always crazy about the decisions they make. With all the money they have I feel like they are just coasting on fumes sometimes. Barely trying. That and they are arrogant sometimes. The over-reliance on iPhone for 80% of their profits is alarming too. Seems unwise. But what do I know....	Fendahl_core	t1_dg0hfi9
t3_647kb5	t1_dg0pfzz	1491704485	You can list all the things that have changed slightly but for the vast majority of people they would only tell the phones apart by the appearance. They have near the exact same experience which is what actually matters not minor increases in statistics    Also stereo speakers on a mobile phone? That's idiotic. And you can have a taptic engine, higher waterproof rating with headphones.  If I'm going for a phone based on a camera buying an iPhone isn't clever at all theyre are much better camera phones.	pastelfruits	t1_dg0ig57

If you can't afford to upgrade your shit across the board, i.e. getting a Bluetooth adapter for your car, buying new headphones; then you obviously don't need the newest and most expensive smartphone available today. People complaining that the new iPhone isn't compatible with their old headphones or can't charge and listen to music at the same time in their 2005 Honda Accord cause it only has one lighting port aren't the kid of people who need to be buying premium smartphones as soon as they come out.	AH_MLP	t1_dg0ig57
t3_647kb5	t1_dg0rpjk	1491708206	I've had my 7+ JB since release date and never once needed to both charge and listen to music... I've never found myself in a situation where both of those were necessary at the same time. If I need to charge it it's the end of the day and I plug it in when I go to bed. If I'm listening to music it's daytime and I'm at work or hanging out. My battery lasts all day. Without fail.   Of course, people will always find something to complain about, usually using scenarios that don't exist in the real world.

t3_647kb5	t1_dg0shkb	1491709508	I'll be honest, I thought it would be a huge issue but the only time I ran into needing to charge it while listening to music was on a road trip for 24 hours straight with it plugged into my aux port.	somebodystolemyname	t1_dg0hfi9
t3_647kb5	t1_dg0srse	1491710000	My 2008 car does not have Bluetooth audio, only an aux port. I work long hours and when I head home on my long commute I want to listen to some music on my phone. But depending on how often I used my phone throughout the day, I also need a charge. It's literally impossible for me to do both now. I love the phone, but ignoring that it is a removed feature and convenience is incredibly ignorant of you. Just because YOU don't need to doesn't mean other people don't.   I also have 2016 car that is my weekend car that has all the features so it's a non issue there. But it is not my daily driver. Not everyone can afford newer model cars where this is no longer an issue, so I imagine a lot of people probably have the same issue I do on my daily work commute.	CTr1gga	t1_dg0rpjk

t3_647kb5	t1_dg0tlcl	1491711293	Sounds like difference in usage cases. I miss being able to just activate Google Now and just speak a random phrase that it immediately Googles with good contextual actions and information. Id try the search on Siri on my iPad and it would just ask me what I meant by that phrase. Also, my Android phone at the time picked up audio better in an empty room, so YMMV I guess.	domeforaklondikebar	t1_dfzzpln
t3_64ax0a	t1_dg0v19l	1491713718	It's not powered directly from the wall socket. The phone cuts off charging current at 100% designated capacity, then lets itself discharge a few %, and then charges again. You're just fooled by its display percentage. You're still using the same amount of energy from the battery.  It's still less straining for the battery than discharging and charging a bigger chunk in one go though.  Edit: I stand corrected. There are indeed devices that work without battery while connected to the wall socket, so iPhones might be the same.	Lysergh	t1_dg0riy2
t3_64ax0a	t1_dg0w6nc	1491716042	I let mine go, but I try to keep it above 30% and usually don't plug it in if it's already above 80%.  I only install apps I actually use and only give location access when necessary.  It's yielded amazing results so far.	pnoozi	t3_64ax0a
t3_64ax0a	t1_dg0w7v6	1491716115	So by leaving it plugged in you aren't harming the battery?	datwolfe1	t1_dg0v19l
t3_64ax0a	t1_dg0x2n1	1491718020	Correct, iOS is designed to cut off power in order to prevent "over charging" once it lowers down a little it will trickle charge back up to 100% and repeat.	Onrain	t1_dg0w7v6
t3_64ax0a	t1_dg0y3sh	1491720485	I thought small devices (not sure if iPhones, Androids, digital cameras, etc, but I know it's not laptops) would discharge from 100% to about 90-95% then charge back up, instead of taking power straight from the wall?	SponTen	t1_dg0rtc4
t3_64ax0a	t1_dg0zo58	1491724744	You're not harming it, but you're not helping it either, since it's still discharging and recharging, just in lots of small two percent chunks rather than one big eighty percent chunk.	roflmyboxes	t1_dg0w7v6

That's not true and I'd like to tell you it's not true but first I'd like to ask you if you want to buy some magic beans? There's a torch with your name on it too for the right price. There's a mini light in it which charges the main light's battery via a solar panel, so unlimited energy!!!	roflmyboxes	t1_dg0riy2
t3_64ax0a	t1_dg10ql0	1491728193	I don't have a choice it's draining all day. I have a charger case because the battery life is so bad.   It's perfect when out and about though, and of course, perfect when the phone switches off at 40% and won't turn on again until you find a power source.	DarkStryder360	t3_64ax0a
t3_64ax0a	t1_dg10v85	1491728640	Let it drain, that's the point of the phone. If you are in a place where you can charge it at all times then an iPhone is not what you need. Buy an iMac.	BuzakaSteve	t3_64ax0a
t3_64ax0a	t1_dg110ko	1491729137	While you're kinda right, I don't think this is how it should be explained. You're saying that one can "minimize" battery cycles by doing this, but charge cycles don't count 0-100, means that a 20-100 charge is the same as 4 times an 80-100 charge. Both is the same usage time though (although your iPhone will trick you into thinking that it takes longer to drop 100-80 than e.g. 40-20, so it's not 100% linear by default). But it's still better to do this because deep discharging and then charging puts a lot more stress in the battery than "tipping off".	kulawik	t1_dg0qlfr

t3_647kb5	t1_dg125qs	1491733251	Heh.  Only the right grille has a speaker. The second speaker is actually the earpiece at the top of the phone. It's meant for stereo in landscape mode, not vertical.

t3_64ax0a	t1_dg16sdy	1491745756	that's an "organic advertising" blog, which quotes popular mechanics.   it's pretty easy to prove it to yourself like I just did, get a phone that has removable battery, plug in the charger, then remove the battery. On the two phones I just now tried it on, the phone remained on.  that is in line with my experience of how charge controller chips work, based on building circuits around them.	mr___	t1_dg16l6z
t3_64ax0a	t1_dg16z8g	1491746118	That's a fair point that I didn't think about. Unless Apple has a special design I guess you're correct.	Lysergh	t1_dg16sdy
t3_647kb5	t1_dg17ay6	1491746731	My car stereo is treated by my phone as a dock. It charges my phone and plays audio at the same time. It's from 2010, which definitely isn't new in any sense.  Maybe these people shouldn't be buying brand new phones when they don't even have a car that's from this decade? Just a thought.   Priorities eh?	hobo_on_oltorf	t1_dg0srse
t3_647kb5	t1_dg17l6p	1491747246	And who exactly are you to tell people that a new car is more important than a new phone? Which is probably the dumbest thing I've ever heard by the way.  It's almost like people have more realistic and different priorities than you.	CTr1gga	t1_dg17ay6
t3_647kb5	t1_dg17n9d	1491747349	Lol considering you have both... I dunno why you're complaining.  I'm saying if you're spending a thousand dollars on a phone but your car can't even support it, why bother? If your transportation is so old it can't support an iPhone, why are you buying a new iPhone? People are dumb.  Why are you being offended on behalf of people that aren't you?	hobo_on_oltorf	t1_dg17l6p
t3_647kb5	t1_dg17run	1491747574	I'm not complaining, I'm speaking for people that most definitely have the same issue as I do on commutes.

Why do you have to insult people that don't think the same?  You get way too angry about people having a different opinion. It's my opinion that *if* everything you own is too old to support your thousand dollar phone, you should probably get some new stuff before you buy something that you can't use with anything else. That doesn't exactly mean getting a new car, you could just swap out your deck.  But whatever, just take a chill pill and calm down man. No need to get so riled up.	hobo_on_oltorf	t1_dg17run

t3_64ax0a	t1_dg1c1oz	1491754201	In the end it's all up to the user. Charging your phone a lot to keep it above 80% will not harm your device nor will it harm the battery as well as charging it from 10-100%. Batteries naturally age no matter how often you charge your device. There have been studies done to show what happens when you charge your device a lot vs when you barely do it at all and they all pointed to the same conclusion: You'll never actually notice any real change for a long time. The batteries we use today are far more advanced than the batteries used 10-15 years ago.   Edit: I charge my phone whenever I next to a plug, but that's not really that often. I'm always mobile so whenever I have a chance I'll charge it, but most of the time it sits around 30-70%	WakaiSenshi	t3_64ax0a

t3_647kb5	t1_dg1eazx	1491757379	Like I said, I upgraded from the Note 2. I owned an S6 Edge, then a BlackBerry Priv... the S6 was a flagship device, I'd say it's fairly representative of most other flagship devices when it comes to Google Now / Assistant performance.	DatDeLorean	t1_dg1e5z3
t3_64ax0a	t1_dg1epam	1491757933	I keep it charged while sleeping, get up in the morning, use constantly until I get in car, and I plug it into the USB there for music etc and also for charging. I occasionally use maps to check the best route to work, but don't need GPS after that as I'm used to the different routes now.  I go to work, and use the shit out of it. If I'm staying late and the charge drops below 50%, I charge it at my desk. If I'm not staying late, I charge it in the car on the way home, get home and charge it at night.  I don't think my phone ever drops below 35-40%. That's with using the camera, facebook, snapchat, telegram, reddit alien blue, some games, VSCO cam, Instagram, and of course messages and phone.  Also none of my chargers are wall plugs, they are all braided USB cables plugged into a computer of some sort (or my car's USB)	LurkerPatrol	t3_64ax0a

One thing I just noticed, though, is that Apple disabled icloud.com on the Android Chrome browser.  I was trying to help someone find their lost iPhone via the Find iPhone feature in iCloud.com but it just shows a message saying the browser is incompatible.  It worked earlier this year.

t3_64ax0a	t1_dg1snbf	1491776782	I'm one of those paranoid people who hates when the battery starts to drain, even if it's at 81%. I charge it whenever I can, sometimes even when it's already at 100%. If I know I have somewhere to be in an hour and my phone is at 97% I still keep it on charge until I have to leave.   Edit: Even during my classes, I'll sit next to an outlet and charge my phone whenever I can. My phone rarely drops below 50% and I like it that way.	papichuloooo	t3_64ax0a
t3_64ax0a	t1_dg1syf3	1491777178	I charge it at night, and whenever I'm near an outlet. Modern batteries like to be charged, and letting them drain often is actually harder on current batteries than keeping them topped up.  I don't understand people who let their iPhones drain over and over again when they're near outlets...yes, you CAN let it drain, but why? I keep that sucker charged as much as possible. Who knows if you'll need that full battery in an emergency or something?	dskatter	t3_64ax0a
t3_64fi6v	t1_dg1tdcx	1491777745	Can you elaborate on this, if you don't mind?  This is what made it so hard for the U.S. government to get into that suspected terrorists phone, right? If it was an Android phone, would have been much easier to get past the lock screen?	N307H30N3	t1_dg1sd5f
t3_64ax0a	t1_dg1ttxr	1491778377	I only think it because I've been told that by engineers before :P  I could be entirely wrong, but I was just told it was to save space in mobile devices. They can't fit another wire between the port and the power supply to bypass the battery, whereas in larger devices like laptops, they can.	SponTen	t1_dg15gos
t3_64fi6v	t1_dg1tw9y	1491778471	The iPhone in the FBI controversy was an iPhone 5C. The 5C also uses software based cryptography, however, the FBI had a lot of trouble getting in simply because they can't change the system, and theres no backdoor on it. iOS uses a long trust chain when booting, if the system is modified the device rejects the files and the boot process stops, this way they couldn't create a version of the OS that would bypass the password because they needed Apple's private key to sign the modified firmware, which Apple denied. On Android devices the bootloader can be modified, and even if it can't officially its often trivial to bypass, in which case the FBI could just change the system partition with their own custom firmware designed to allow them access. A hacker can similarly flash malware to your system partition and silently steal data.   Modern iPhones (5S or newer) have even better solutions: Coupled with the normal CPU there's a coprocessor called Secure Enclave (Usually shortened to SEP). The SEP runs its own firmware, the main CPU and applications cannot read the memory allocated to the SEP, and the SEP will handle all Touch ID related information and the cryptography keys that protect user data. The SEP is also hardware locked to the SOC, so you can't change the Touch ID button or the SEP in order to try to steal the data.  This means that if you don't know the password you can't get the data, there's just no way, even if you carefully removed the NAND chip and dumped its data you would still need to brute force the key, which would take hundreds of years.   The last known bootrom exploit for the iPhone was the Limera1n one, it was patched in 2011 with the iPhone 4S, ever since then there's no exploit capable of signing custom firmwares, meaning users are safe.   The kernel also is got two security modules to try to detect memory manipulation on the fly, that's KPP and memprot, and although not perfect they are really hard to bypass. Any current exploit to the iPhone only happens *after* the user already typed in their password, thus unlocking the filesystem, if you have a locked iPhone you can't access the data, period. With Android, a talented teenager with some computer science curiosity can figure out how to unlock the phone.  At an user level, iOS apps run with a true sandbox that prevents an app of looking into another app's data without user approval, on Android I could create an app that sniffs though your WhatsApp media without telling you.   Maybe security means nothing to you, and that's fine, but it is an area where iOS is years ahead of Android, so if you do care about it, its a strong point favoring iOS.	kadupse	t1_dg1tdcx
t3_64ax0a	t1_dg1vlor	1491780806	The port definitely goes to a chip that both the phone and battery are connected (separately) to. the chip directs power to the battery in controlled amounts to charge it, and regulates the current coming out of  the battery or charger to power the phone	mr___	t1_dg1ttxr

t3_64fi6v	t1_dg2auqk	1491805639	The general consensus is that Google pixel camera is better than the iPhone 7, and I'd say cases and accessories for many popular Android phones are just as easy to come by as iPhone products these days. Especially with things moving to usb-c (and having a headphone jack) you don't have to deal with proprietary connectors which is a huge benefit. Ever notice how a USB cable is like half the price of a similar lightning cable (or even less)?	my_knee_grows	t1_dg222cp
t3_64fi6v	t1_dg2avxi	1491805722	This isn't really a valid argument anymore. Modern Android is just as smooth, fast (even faster in many cases) and reliable as iOS. In fact I've heard more complaints about iOS 10 than Android N	my_knee_grows	t1_dg1s86b

But what I had in my android phone was that if you wanted to make calls, just open the dial pad and type the name of the person by tapping on the numbers which contain the letters in the said person's name and the contact will show up. That's one difference that bugs me	BoredAtWork_420	t1_dg2alus

t3_64fi6v	t1_dg2bvqm	1491808342	This is no longer true. Have a look at Samsung's Knox for example - if you modify the system in any way, it blows an e-fuse and erases everything. Also the encryption is hardware based, not slowing down the system at all.  iPhone was definitely the first to take security seriously; fortunately, others did follow suit.	matus201	t1_dg1sd5f
t3_64fi6v	t1_dg2bzxw	1491808665	The last point is a little misleading: the "SD card" (or emulated "SD card" if the phone does not have expandable storage) is indeed accessible from any app, this is by design so that your music library or pictures or documents can be opened from any app. However, the actual app data is accessible by that particular app only. Why WhatsApp decided to store its media files in the accessible SD card storage I don't know, but it is clearly defined as a storage that can be accessed and modified by any app. (Little off topic, but WhatsApp does encrypt all your messages, so while you can access the shared pictures and videos from any app, you cannot read the message contents.)	matus201	t1_dg1tw9y

t3_64fi6v	t1_dg2esof	1491817342	Until it isn't. The S8 just came out and the iPhone 7, with apparently lower hardware specs, outperforms it. Android phones decay over time. The more apps you install and the more you use it the slower it gets.  iPhones don't do that. They just keep working like they always did.  It's like comparing a Windows PC that you have to reinstall every year or so (at least with older versions of Windows) to a game console that "just works, forever".	oheard	t1_dg2ax78

t3_64fi6v	t1_dg2h9tg	1491824148	Coming out "as fast".  Not receiving the same features purposely.  But no addressing the wake lock battery drain issue that most people have.  Also "Beta".  Yeah I was on Betas too.  More issues.  Amazing. /S Like when my Nexus 5 was awesome then they started with the wake lock issues there.  Then you're going to tell me about some nonsensical excuse.  I went from high end BlackBerry to Android and never to iPhone until recently.  IOS does a few things I don't like.  But as an overall package and experience including having an Apple store right by my house if the need for them ever arises is way better than what Google and Android can currently provide.  Also the Nexus 6P is a beautiful phone.  It worked OK initially then just got worse.  How a phone like that can only get 2.5 to 3 hours SoT is ridiculous.  The worst part of the whole thing is I got friends and family to buy them too. Everyone has the same issues.  And then I'll get the BS excuse that it a rogue app.  I whittled my apps down to 10 outside of the standard google apps, gmail, calendar, et al. and to no avail.  My friends Note 4 still blowing my SoT out of the water.  So I spoke with my wallet.  Maybe Pixel 2 XL will be waterproof and have great battery life and I will come back.  But for now. I am going to stick with slightly Apple.	BourbonZawa	t1_dg2clv3
t3_64fi6v	t1_dg2hccq	1491824312	you're not right.  I had a 6P.  Ever try finding a USB C cable until recently?  Ever buy one that wasn't Benson tested?  Ever walk into a Macy's or Nordstroms and see which phone accessories they have?  I am talking about ease of life not cost.  I'll give you the headphone jack is a stupid move on Apples part.  I got stuck once or twice without it.  But the ability to use my phone as i want for days on end without needing a recharge nor having any issues is amazing, ESPECIALLY when I need it for work.

t3_64fi6v	t1_dg2i6ga	1491826082	Exactly as u/BoredAtWork_420 said: you have to go to contacts and find the person, then click the phone icon, then dial.  It is tough to be honest.  On stock Android: you open dialer and start typing either name or number and all matching contacts come up or conversely if you need to search for a number you can just use the search bar on top of the dialer. I know that for a lot of people this isn't an issue because they don't actually make that many calls anymore, but unfortunately I do.  And it's a little thing that just sucks up time pointlessly when you use your phone to call a lot.  Also Apple is all about ease and it is clear that this something that no one has ever gone back to.  Unless there is an easier that I don't know? I am newish to IOS.	BourbonZawa	t1_dg2alus

Everywhere I've seen that has lightning cables also has microusb which was the Android standard until recently.

t3_64j5jp	t1_dg2q3av	1491837163	Its typically a feature added onto your account. It should be free but every carrier is different. In the past when I have seen similar things its because either visual voicemail is not setup on the account and it knows you have voicemail saved, or the voicemail box is stuck somehow and needs to be reset. Keep in mind resetting typically erases all of your saved messages.	drice99	t1_dg2pzdn
t3_64fi6v	t1_dg2q7tr	1491837305	Benchmark speed, apple will win, but many real world things are or feel faster on my pixel. I can open the camera faster (double click the power button), the camera takes photos faster, opening apps generally feels faster (this is primarily due to the speed of the animations on iOS). Switching between apps with a dedicated button is faster for me than the UX of double clicking the home button on iOS (though some 3d touch stuff is decent, although I could never get the 3d touch app swipe gesture down reliably) scrolling feels more sensitive and responsive on my pixel (don't know how to explain this exactly but it feels like I can fling a list more easily on my pixel). Having a dedicated back button makes it faster to navigate (yes I know about the swipe to go back, not all iOS apps have that).   What I mean in a lot of cases is I can do things more quickly on the pixel (real world usage), not necessarily raw speed (benchmarks). iOS UX has gotten pretty bad in a lot of places and I find it's just easier to do a lot of stuff on my pixel. And this is coming from someone who only had an iPhone for the last 5+ years	my_knee_grows	t1_dg2ldni
t3_64fi6v	t1_dg2q83q	1491837314	I am not looking to argue with you about if's and when's USB C will be "everywhere" And my iPhone 7 Plus easily lasts 2 days without limiting use "Magically". Our experiences are very different because my 6P couldn't last a full day and sometimes decided it was turning off if there wasn't enough battery.  And you may not be shopping for iPhone cases at Nordstroms or Macys, but iPhone accessories are so easily attained and ubiquitous in our society that they can be found in department stores in the accessory areas.  Well at least in the USA.	BourbonZawa	t1_dg2pnre
t3_64fi6v	t1_dg2qhgf	1491837604	My point is wherever I've seen lightning cables for sale, including at gas stations, I've seen micro USB cables (the Android equivalent) for sale right alongside them. USB C will replace microusb as time goes on. And so what if you can buy an iPhone case at Macy's but not a 6P case? That's not really that useful. I'll take your word on the battery life. My iPhone 6s died after like 6 hours of moderate use when it read 30% before I replaced the battery (which was a year after I purchased the phone)	my_knee_grows	t1_dg2q83q
t3_64fi6v	t1_dg2qjwg	1491837681	On iPhone you just swipe down from the middle of any home screen to open Spotlight search. Start to type the name of the person you want to call, and their contacts will show up. Then you can call/text/FaceTime from there with a single tap.  That sounds almost exactly the same as the Android method?  Also there is a search function built into Contacts.	colin_staples	t1_dg2b25n

I'm not claiming that what you're saying is not true, it's definitely easier to find a case for an iphone than an android phone, all I'm saying is that I don't think that's a benefit that make it worth choosing an iphone over an android phone. If that's really a dealbreaker for you, so be it, but most people don't buy cases very often and if you are shopping for a phone case there are plenty of options for android as well as iphone, just not at your local department store	my_knee_grows	t1_dg2qtdx

t3_64fi6v	t1_dg2zcgq	1491847164	TBH this isn't super fair of a comparison. If you want to talk about OS speed, you should only be looking at OS tasks. You can see that all of the *system* animations and speed, the pixel beats the iPhone every time, but once you get inside the individual apps, some of the android variants are slower. Comparing the time it takes for subway surfers to get past the splash screen is really just saying that "the iOS subway surfers app is faster than the android subway surfers app" which is clearly true but that doesn't mean android is slower, it just means that particular app is slower on android	my_knee_grows	t1_dg2xn0u

t3_64fi6v	t1_dg321lq	1491849973	Yes but just because Pixel has faster animations in OS taks doesn't mean it's the faster phone.  Loading Subway Surfer shows that iPhone is using much faster storage. And OS optimization as well.	Eddytion	t1_dg2zcgq
t3_64j5jp	t1_dg324f0	1491850058	Places_ may have the best answer.

t3_64fi6v	t1_dg34ll0	1491852645	Sure, I already agreed that apple has better silicon, but in the real world, the fast animations makes it *feel* faster.   And no, loading Subway surfers isn't fair to make any conclusions about storage speed and OS optimization. Extreme example but the people who wrote the app could have just put "wait 3 seconds before showing the app" in the Android version but not the iOS version.	my_knee_grows	t1_dg321lq
t3_64fi6v	t1_dg3673p	1491854299	Coming from a galaxy s4 and after that an s6 to a used 6s, a few things. Battery is much better on the iphone, even after years of use. And the fingerprint sensor actually works. Imessage works anything better than my galaxy. And the stock UX is just much better on the iphone. The stock apps from apple aren't as much bloatware as on the android.	voxnex	t3_64fi6v
t3_64fi6v	t1_dg37zvm	1491856174	Maybe not loading Subway Surfers only, but people have loaded so many games till now and an Android phone still has to win a single game-loading-test. Again, I love both of my phones equally, but in this kind of race, Apple wins big time. S7e screen is miles ahead of iPh, the design is more modern and the camera is better than 6splus and head to head with 7+.  I understand what you mean, but in the long run we all know who's going to be the more reliable phone with the latest updates that just works.	Eddytion	t1_dg34ll0
t3_64fi6v	t1_dg3a0rj	1491858306	Idk man, I have the pixel and I get monthly updates, new Android os as soon as it's available, have had absolutely zero stability issues so far, and the speed and smoothness is definitely as good in my experience as it was on my 6s. I miss iMessage, the dedicated hardware mute switch, and my 6s with a fresh battery lasted *sliiightly* longer, but the Google assistant is a million times better than Siri, navigation with Android's back and app switcher buttons is much quicker, the notification system on Android is infinitely better, and I'm able to use whatever apps I want to do whatever I want. For example, I use signal for messaging, but not all my friends have signal, so I set signal as my default SMS app. Now I only have to use one app instead of 2 on iOS. Plus the camera and screen on the pixel are for sure better than the iPhone counterparts and I have a headphone jack.   Really my main point in all of this is that at the end of the day, iOS vs Android in 2017 comes down to personal preference. Neither is better than the other. There's almost nothing that an iPhone can do that an Android phone can't and vice versa. The days of "Android is slower and less reliable" are basically dead. Anyone who disagrees hasn't used a pixel. I personally find Android OS easier and more intuitive than iOS (which is crazy cuz I didn't think that at all a few years back).

t3_608lh6	t1_dg3edeg	1491863446	I used to have the Caudabe and I'd say it's got a bit more grip than the Veil XT. However, my bf has a Tozo case and if you're looking for something similarly slim but way grippier, I think I'd recommend that.	quirkyrocket	t1_dg316n0

t3_64fi6v	t1_dg3f6pu	1491864475	I have both platforms. New to iOS, 8 year android user. iMessage blows me away. Sending a file or uncompressed pic, bam done. I love android but sometimes it just feels "incomplete "	CuntyMcFagNuts69	t3_64fi6v

t3_64n0xq	t1_dg3g5m9	1491865730	First two pages are my most used apps organized by theme (Camera/Photo, News, Music, Social, Work, etc). Then the rest are just in alphabetical order, but with all the Apple apps I don't use in a 'Bloat' folder on the last page.  I really wish iOS would adopt Android's 'app drawer' concept or something, so I could just hide all those other apps out of the way.	redavid	t3_64n0xq

t3_647kb5	t1_dg3gkc7	1491866264	But it's not common. You're projecting your own specific needs on other people and that's not helpful. The population of people that have cars that only have AUX jacks and need to charge while they're driving is I hope you'll admit very low. And you CAN buy an adapter to do just that.   So if you think a company can make anything that is perfect for 100% of their customers you're sadly mistaken. There isn't any iPhone 7 users that can't be accommodated either as it is or with the purchase of an inexpensive adapter.	tsdguy	t1_dg0hfi9
t3_64n0xq	t1_dg3gn0q	1491866360	I have six pages. The first being the default first page apps (with a few modifications) and then added Facebook, YouTube, and have a folder with Apple maps and Google maps in it, and a folder with Instagram and Twitter in it. Second page is apps but not games (e.g. reddit, banking, google drive) and I sort them on most used to least. Then a page for games, a page for shopping apps, and finally a page for default apple apps (including new clips app), all sorted in the same way.  EDIT: Realised I missed the last page. Has apps from a few restaurants/shops that give me free food on my birthday :)  EDIT 2: Realised I explained how I lay out my home screen not my apps, oh well.	canamar	t3_64n0xq

My first page is made up of my most frequently used apps - Spotify, banking, weather, work email app, etc.   The second page is categorized by app theme - utilities, video, shopping, finance, etc. each app goes in the the corresponding folder.

t3_64n0xq	t1_dg3s8nx	1491880984	Yeah. So like my main bank account - that app is on the main page.

t3_64ptjs	t1_dg4hadp	1491927256	TIL. I always just assumed they were interchangeable.  https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/to-get-passed-get-past.1140600/  &gt;Hi,  &gt;1) "To get passed" is grammatically correct, but only in a completely different situation. In this sense, "to pass" means to throw or give something from one person to another. It's often used in sports - The football got passed from the quarterback to the receiver.   &gt;However, this sounds very clumsy for two reasons:  &gt;a) It's much better to use the verb "was" - "The football was passed..." b) It's better to use active voice in the first place - "The quarterback passed the football to the receiver."  &gt;2) "To get past" and "to pass up" have very different connotations. The first implies overcoming an obstacle, either emotional or physical. The second implies missing an opportunity.   &gt;Some examples:  &gt;"This video game is so hard! I can't get past the second level!" "I know the divorce was very traumatic for you, but you have to get past it and move on with your life."  &gt;"I passed up my chance to invest in Google stock while it was cheap." "Don't pass up this fantastic opportunity - you'll regret it!"  Source: Some guy on WordReference	ItsBeenFun2017	t1_dg4ecx1

In case that there actually are significant changes in battery life then it's most likely due to how they've been using their phone recently (More/less screen-on time, more/less use of heavy applications like google maps etc.) I've updated my phone several times ever since i got it and the battery life has been exactly the same as day 1.

t3_64vnst	t1_dg5dy61	1491966600	The Google play store has plenty of apps, but like you said, most aren't as optimized or work as well as on the iPhone. The stock messaging app works Okay but at the end of the day is still just sms so you will miss out on iMessage. I haven't had an android phone since the gs6 edge so while I can't comment on the s7 or s8, the s6 was GREAT, for about 3 months. After that I started getting battery drains, slowdowns, and just overall an inconsistent user experience I never had with iPhone. I personally prefer android for the customization your allowed on it but at the end of the day will always stick with iPhone, at least until android gets a little more stable.	cw9311	t3_64vnst

t3_64vnst	t1_dg5e3a7	1491966804	I just recently made the switch back to iPhone from an S7 Edge. The google play store has a more broad selection of apps, but not all of them function well. The default messenger app on my S7 worked, but nothing like iMessage. iMessage is a big reason I switched back. Most of my family and friends have iPhones. So losing iMessage was a killer for me. Also, I had a lot of trouble with group texts with my S7. I wouldn't receive them or it wouldn't stay in the group for some reason. That was the third android device I've tried and I always end up coming back to an iPhone. Hope this helps your dilemma.	pilot-mikus14	t3_64vnst
t3_64vkgg	t1_dg5e9h2	1491967056	I don't think it's that at all - the devices today have plenty of overhead to handle that.  However, there's the engineering and support level from Apple that has to take place.  Without being on the inside of the goings-on at Apple, one can only guess that there is some amount of work to keep that supported.  It's the same as any older system in place that is hitting a critical level of being more work to support that what a business is getting in return.  I think more importantly, if there are important legacy apps, the key might be finding out why the developer isn't updating them (it's been almost four years since the 5S was introduced) or if there is another tool better suited for the job.  People got up in arms about AT&amp;T shutting down their 2G/EDGE network on January 1, and while some people had to get new phones, the level of work to keep it running crossed the threshold of not being worth it.  Some spectrum has been reused, but in a many places, the equipment has just been turned off without being replaced.  Apple is no different and some features are phased out way too early, but I think this has been an ongoing process that many developers and businesses have seen in progress for awhile.	ecs0013	t1_dg5dpby
t3_64vkgg	t1_dg5eich	1491967422	So the real reason Apple doesn't want to support 32 bit apps is because they don't want to pay for it. Do I have that right?	Mister_Kurtz	t1_dg5e9h2
t3_64vkgg	t1_dg5f0c2	1491968185	In almost every situation, the reason a company does something is because they decided that the benefit of the thing outweighed the costs of doing it.   There is an extra cost of maintaining the 32-bit libraries that support 32-bit apps. Every time they find a security issue, or add a new feature, they have to pay someone to fix the old 32-bit libraries and more importantly test those changes. They decided that that person could be doing something more valuable, so they stopped paying for it.	corgion	t1_dg5eich
t3_64vkgg	t1_dg5f9o9	1491968588	Sometimes a company will decide "we should do this because it provides greater usability to our customer base."	Mister_Kurtz	t1_dg5f0c2
t3_64vkgg	t1_dg5fico	1491968976	I guess you could assign a dollar amount to using resources (engineers, developers, time, etc.) to keep supporting aging infrastructure.  It's no different than Microsoft cutting off support for security patches and updates for old versions of Windows or Apple eventually internally categorizing old devices as "vintage" or "obsolete" meaning that service providers won't be able to obtain parts for really old equipment (I think right now it's mostly all devices from about 2010 and older).  At some point they need to draw a line and move on - it's happened with macOS before (just about everything from OS X before 10.5 will have trouble running on current hardware and builds of 10.12 because of the changes in libraries, APIs, and other things under-the-hood…how many things are still set up to work with .Mac or MobileMe?)  I'm guessing the "warning" on 10.3 and under Settings &gt; About &gt; Apps is to hopefully shame some developers into updating their apps to more modern methods of development and also educate users for what software is probably abandonware at this point.  Apple has always had a pretty long tail on deprecating old methods and tools and so most things like this aren't a surprise.  Even with the switch to Lightning in 2012, the Dock Connector was in use for 9 years and very clunky and aged in its final years.  Although they could've thrown an adapter in the iPhone box, they still support many old speakers and accessories with those adapters some five years later.  So without being in Cupertino and seeing the cost/benefit ratio of supporting software that hasn't been touched in years, I can only venture to guess that there is some level of it being too much work for old stuff.	ecs0013	t1_dg5eich
t3_64vkgg	t1_dg5g1k9	1491969830	You should compare apples to apples. My Windows10 x64 STILL supports 32 bit apps.  "At some point ... move on."  Why not move on due to demand? This is the difference between MS and Apple. MS recognizes users actually use 32 bit apps, and then support them. When this demand wanes, like support for 8 bit apps, then support is pulled.   Why not let the market/user demand decide rather than cutting off a number of apps current users find useful?	Mister_Kurtz	t1_dg5fico

t3_64vkgg	t1_dg5hk6j	1491972483	It's hard to compare "apples to apples" because in the Windows world, you're running an OS that can run on a variety of hardware combinations designed and produced by different vendors.  There's also the pressure Microsoft is put under to support everything for almost an eternity because some business somewhere needs it.  Both of those things work for them and can't necessarily argue against that for how they run their business.  Apple tends to support technologies for a reasonable amount of time, but will phase things out if they are becoming less popular or necessary.  Sometimes these are a bit ambitious and premature (MacBook and MacBook Pro), but other times they happen and people find they really aren't missing an older technology (internal optical drives come to mind).  However, the iOS transition to 64-bit apps started in 2013 and the process (from what I had heard) was always pretty easy for developers.  Those holdouts now probably aren't maintaining their apps or updating them anyway.  This hasn't been sudden either—Apple has been telling developers to support 64-bit since 2014 with a mandatory inclusion since 2015: https://9to5mac.com/2014/10/20/apple-to-require-ios-apps-and-updates-to-use-ios-8-sdk-and-include-64-bit-support-from-february-2015/  From what I was able to turn up, it looks like the change would also affect how they develop future CPUs and what resources are tied to those: http://www.androidauthority.com/apple-killing-32-bit-support-746644/  I know it's easy to say, "well, 32-bit and 64-bit software can and should coexist and it should be the same across all platforms and architectures," but I think even that's hard or qualify, as x86/x64 and ARM are very different beasts.  Microsoft has had to support older software longer, but also went through some of the teething of 32-bit and 64-bit builds of Windows that were separate.  OS X gradually phased it in and made it the main focus once 32-bit machines aged out and support was dropped.  On the mobile side, there were a lot of 64-bit SoCs on Android and Windows Mobile phones, but only more recently has software been written to take advantage of this.  Looking at my devices, the only apps that are showing up as 32-bit only are some old games that are abandonware at this point.  Is there a particular tool you're afraid of losing or just trying to argue principle?  I think there's plenty of people here that can help with the former, but as for the latter, I think outside of Apple's headquarters, we're all just speculating.	ecs0013	t1_dg5g1k9

t3_64vnst	t1_dg5jcjn	1491975971	Play Store is full of garbage, finding quality apps is difficult. There is virtually no quality control.  Android phones decay with age, getting gradually slower.  Android phones don't receive timely updates, vast majority are full of security flaws. Samsung is no exception.  Was an Android user for years. Believed all the crap about Apple being an overpriced version of the same thing. It was all lies. Apple rules, Android sucks.  Not only that but the iPhone 7 is actually faster than the S8 in real-world tests. Samsung has a better CPU on paper but a good CPU with crap software is a waste of money.  I'd wait until the next iPhone comes out. No doubt it'll look even better than the S8 anyway and you'd probably wish you'd waited.	oheard	t3_64vnst

t3_64vkgg	t1_dg5s463	1491999455	To pay for it by limiting what they can do with future hardware just to continue 32bit support? Be realistic, the best way to handle this for the user is to do exactly what Apple IS doing. Stop supporting 32bit apps and leave the option for those users to use those old apps to users who want/need to use them by simply keeping or acquiring a 32bit device. These can be found at millions of garage sales everywhere.	portnux	t1_dg5eich
t3_64vkgg	t1_dg5sjf1	1492000224	For the same reason that they removed the headphone jack - they are removing legacy to focus on the future.   The headphone jack was questionable, but 32-bit is obsolete.	newfonehudis	t3_64vkgg
t3_64vnst	t1_dg5tk4b	1492001904	In addition to all the comments already put here.....Apple has a reliable back up and restore.  Android has plenty of apps that promise to do the same.

t3_64vnst	t1_dg5ub5v	1492003056	I've used Android for my whole life till I switched to an Iphone 7+ last month. I can say that overall I prefer the Android interface and customization, but as everyone said the optimization just isn't there yet, for both apps and the OS. The only Android phones that come closer are the stock ones, such as the Nexus and the Pixel. The S8, as most of Samsug's recent smartphones, is a beautiful piece of hardware, but the OS (specially the non-stock Samsung shoves down your throat) is simply a no-go for me.	lucasbaile	t3_64vnst

t3_64yesp	t1_dg6fm36	1492026320	My theory, after spending time here in China, is that there isn't a killer app for them in the US.  In China, Wechat is the predominant messaging platform, and also is sort of the equivalent of facebook and paypal.  And they first introduced QR codes as a way to add someone as a contact - one person shows their qr code and the other person scans it.  Or you can put it on your business card, or your booth counter.  I think because they doubled down on this, every Chinese person both knows what a QR code is, and how to scan one.  I think we're lacking that in the US, such that your average person doesn't have anything on their phone that can scan a QR code.  Now, an interesting question is why there isn't QR code scanning built into the iOS and Android camera apps...	scotty314	t1_dg6f4bx
t3_64yesp	t1_dg6h702	1492027935	Ahh, Wechat pushed adoption... I use them on business cards and just about everything else I can come up with. I have also wondered why it isn't in the stock camera apps. First thing I do with a new device is install ZXing.	HTXLoveThisPlace	t1_dg6fm36

t3_64yesp	t1_dg7j00w	1492089632	What is the point of this video? You buy all of the parts (easily doable via iphone repair shops / ebay) and then have someone assemble it, anywhere in the world.   Then it ends up costing you more than a new iphone because the difficult steps of the process are - get this - difficult. Which is why people go to either legit or grey market shops that have the tools, parts and expertise already and can do it quickly.   Personally, I liked looking at all of the sights in China and the people, but the video was equally interesting muted and skipping around than watching this exercise in futility.   Never mind some of the authentication problems you're likely to have unless you go to the black market to "break" the hardware and software auth. Didn't cover that in the video.   Also, "making" your own iPhone when you really mean "doing most of the assembling of it" is disingenuous, yes?	eqleriq	t3_64yesp

t3_653ba8	t1_dg7kaj4	1492091360	They would have to completely re-design the shell of the phone to incorporate a glass back in order to implement that, it will not work through metal. Just because its a trivial thing theory doesn't make it trivial to implement.  Personally don't want a glass back. It breaks easily, is slippery to hold, and looks like crap the second you pick up the phone.	x3n0n1c	t1_dg7adlc
t3_653ba8	t1_dg7lhya	1492092886	Well that's not our problem. If they intended to offer wireless charging with the iPhone 8, they should've thought about the redesign. They've had years to make this work.	itsmegeorge	t1_dg7kaj4

t3_653ba8	t1_dg7u32e	1492102288	I've jumped ship and back.. The grass is not greener on the other side.   At least in my experience with Samsung, you'll miss not having good customer service and being able to walk into a store to get your phone replaced on the spot if needed.  Also timely updates are nonexistent (enjoy being 1 year behind other Android versions).   Your phone will have a ton of memory, but it'll be irrelevant, because the OS is built on poor software .. So it will be slower than your iPhone with half the memory.  Oh, and poor battery life...	fkviz	t1_dg7rl38
t3_653ba8	t1_dg7unh7	1492102883	I'm more interested in the LG G6 or waiting for the next Pixel. I've got friends and family with Samsung devices and none of them are just in love with them.	catchesbass	t1_dg7u32e
t3_653ba8	t1_dg7vwq8	1492104221	Unless Apple drastically improve wireless charging you are going to be terribly disappointed and will end up always just using a cable anyway.  It's inefficient and slow comparatively and you can't use your phone while charging like you can with a cable.  Situations of throwing it down on your desk and picking it up when you need it is great in theory, until one day you need to rush out, to find your phone has charged 20% in the hour it's been on charge and is so hot that if you use it instantly it discharges quickly - at least this was my experience with my LG G4.

t3_653ba8	t1_dg7wv6m	1492105239	Yeah, no hope on my end of them moving to USB-C. If they did, they could justify it by the iPhone 8 being a new chassis over the 7. Also if they introduced new iPads (with USB-C) at an iPhone event that would smooth things over on a Lightning to USB-C transition.	stehekin	t1_dg7tz3v
t3_653ba8	t1_dg7x4ms	1492105521	The 6S/+ as well as the SE are so good on memory and CPU that I see them lasting longer than any other iPhone so far without losing performance with software updates. Only natural decline I see is battery. I'm glad I got a 6s.	wandreylust	t1_dg7tqcv

t3_653ba8	t1_dg80rpa	1492109395	I had wireless charging on my palm pre.  It was fantastic.  I just set it on the charger when I was at home and picked it up when I left.  It's similar to magsafe vs non-magsafe in terms of convenience.  Bonus that it turned into a clock while on the charger.  I actually bought a Veer for that exact reason (I had the old charging bricks laying around).  The thing that would concern me the most is heat.  Sending electrical current through a medium heats it up and on my pre that caused the battery to expand a bit.  Apple would have to find a way to reduce the heat or keep the area where the electrical transfer took place battery free.	Mrredditorson	t1_dg7vwq8

t3_653ba8	t1_dg81opm	1492110390	&gt; Personally don't want a glass back. It breaks easily, is slippery to hold,  Sorry but it is the complete opposite. The current aluminum design is one of the most slippery surfaces I have ever encountered. My Jet Black iPhone has insane grip which is the same as if it were glass. I will never miss the matte of my iPhone 6.	sekazi	t1_dg7kaj4

t3_653ba8	t1_dg88y5z	1492118506	I feel like apple is waiting for a 4K display. TBH as someone who sold electronics for a now defunct chain... on these size screens that's the only jump that matters and it is incremental at best. Apple has been rumored to order a lot of "slightly curved" OLED displays. So I think our next iPhone is a curved OLED display with a metal back. Integrated home button and bezel-less display.	SasquatchButterpants	t1_dg88oux
t3_653ba8	t1_dg8akz4	1492120531	It doesn't really have any sides to hold on to, it's like it's designed to be as bad to hold as possible. Glass backs can be nice and grippy if it's done right.	Svviftie	t1_dg88lqo
t3_653ba8	t1_dg8cy62	1492123620	You're really rude and it's my policy to not respond to any comments which insult me in any way (see: "you're delusional") and just report them, but I will tell you one thing that my delusional mind knows. I don't care if they have to redesign the phone and I really don't think wireless charging is a feature with very limited use. Because if it was, it wouldn't be offered in almost all Android flagships. Leave it to my delusional self to judge whether wireless charging is of very limited use or not and next time please be more polite. I think if the world handled the redesign that came with the 4 and then the with 6, a redesign with the 8 that will allow the company to introduce new features that will further strengthen their "it just works" concept will be more than welcome. But I don't expect a person with a garbage attitude like yours to understand this.	itsmegeorge	t1_dg7wkbh

t3_653ba8	t1_dg8ghjh	1492128365	You should **not** take someone telling you "you're delusional" as an insult. u/x3n0n1c has a point, the aluminum unibody is a sexy design that sells very well, and Apple is fairly committed to this design and manufacturing strategy. He is correct to say that you are delusional *iff* he understands you to be saying that they should have pivoted sooner to a design that incorporates wireless charging. That said, I think apple agrees with you and that's why there's this supposed 10th anniversary iPhone.	BRAlNlAC	t1_dg8cy62

t3_653ba8	t1_dg8n2q3	1492137507	Grow up. Go read your original comments and see the attitude you yourself exhibited.   As for most android flagships having wireless charging, let's think last year.   LG G5. Nope.   HTC 10. Nope.   Google Pixel. Nope.   One Plus 3. Nope.   LG V20. Nope.  S7 and S7 Edge. Yay finally found one.	x3n0n1c	t1_dg8cy62

t3_653ba8	t1_dg8w7x5	1492154871	Thanks. I'll tell you why I was insulted, this person called me delusional because I didn't see any reason why they wouldn't have thought about this beforehand, seeing as we've many times seen Apple do think forward and they have "secured" plans for at least 3 years down the road (see Jobs and how he had given them the 5 schematis before the 4 was out) and then they even went as far as saying wireless charging is of limited use. I make a point in never shoving my belief down someone's throat and if someone shares a different view than mine, I don't go calling them delusional. If that person thinks wireless charging is useless then that's fine. Doesn't mean it is, doesn't mean I think it is. Because at the end of the day we WILL see a redesigned new iPhone, so my original comment isn't that far off. I have no doubt aluminum design sells well and I like it myself, but I don't think they would choose this between wireless charging (which people have been asking for a long time) and it. If they do, it's like telling us they're never going to introduce the feature, since it doesn't work with aluminum.	itsmegeorge	t1_dg8ghjh

t3_65mqzp	t1_dgbkmdc	1492310831	Aren't the 650s one of the ones that will get a bit more support?  I picked one up from Cricket for 99¢ to play around with (always liked the Windows Phone UI), even though my daily driver is an iPhone SE.  Comparing the two, the SE's hardware does _feel_ a bit more dated in that it's smaller (screen) and chunky (thickness, especially when you add a case), but still a great design overall.  However, it seems to me that the SE's camera is better, CPU is much better, and obviously the software ecosystem is more robust.  It really is the apples-to-oranges comparison, but objectively, the SE is a very good device and if you do jump ship to iOS, you get a lot of bang for your buck.  Basically, you're getting the same class of performance as the iPhone 6s and new iPad (A9 chip) and most of the important Apple bells and whistles, while leaving some off that are _nice to have_ like 3D Touch, second-gen Touch ID, and LTE-Advanced.	ecs0013	t3_65mqzp
t3_65mqzp	t1_dgbm50b	1492313097	Typing this on my SE. (Fairly new to me, but bought used.) Performance is excellent. Camera is great. Size is what it is--you'll like it or get rid of it (I like it as an alternative to a large phone.) Feel in the hand is just right. And the industrial design is, IMO, Apple's best to date.	JEJ514	t3_65mqzp
t3_65mqzp	t1_dgbmjmw	1492313733	My 6s got lost (ugh..) and I bought an 128gb SE to replace it &amp; I dig it well enough.  I always loved the look of the 5s and have thought of going down to an SE and losing my 6s made it actually happen. Going down to a 4-inch screen again is definitely weird but the more I use it I'm getting used to it.	youthcanoe	t3_65mqzp

t3_65oujp	t3_65oujp	1492345294	iPhone 7+ owners, what do you have to do in order to ensure the battery is drained before the day is over?	Makegooduseof	-1
t3_65mqzp	t1_dgbz7oq	1492345754	An excellent small form phone. Super enjoyable. Good camera, good overall performance, good battery. I've had mine for about half a year and zero complaints, but I upgraded from an iPhone 5 so I had zero adjustment to the size or OS.	Docster87	t3_65mqzp
t3_65mqzp	t1_dgbz8ox	1492345821	I've had the SE (64Gb) since launch day. It's the best phone I've ever had and will be using it for the next several years. Go for it.	plyboult	t3_65mqzp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgbzdd3	1492346135	I usually have around 8 or 9 hours of active time before reaching the low battery warning. With typical use that'll be around 30 to 40 hours of standby, too.	DatDeLorean	t3_65oujp
t3_65mqzp	t1_dgbzuud	1492347244	I owned an SE and upgraded to a 6S. Whilst the SE is a rock solid device, it's very cramped with that screen size. I'm not sure what size your Lumia 650 is, but I'd give an SE a long test before deciding. I find my 6S a lot more useful.	pmrr	t3_65mqzp
t3_65mqzp	t1_dgc01o8	1492347661	The only con to the SE is that all us hardcore SE devotees have to admit that the latest versions of iOS are designed with larger screen sizes in mind, and not at all optimised for the SE.  Otherwise, it's stellar.	CLENVENMETINS	t3_65mqzp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc045c	1492347810	Honestly I can empty my iPhone 7plus battery easily in a day with a lot of snapchat, reddit, google maps usage etc.	41298	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc17ym	1492349961	I work from home, so I am always next to a charger if needed. I used to be really worried about battery. But after having this phone for 90 days or so I dont even look at battery, I have pretty decently heavy use and I have only his under 25% once	JediSamReye2013	t3_65oujp
t3_65mqzp	t1_dgc29xf	1492351820	The Lumia 650 has a 5" screen. I saw the smaller size when I read up on the specs. That is one of my concerns with switching. Thanks for the consideration.	FFXIV_Aeria	t1_dgbzuud

t3_65oujp	t1_dgc2c41	1492351920	When I travel, I always listen to music and I play games during flights, I usually then use maps a lot. Never had to charge it before sleeping time.	Timeowner	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc2gul	1492352133	Im normally on my phone all day for work and fun and I dont normally get the low battery pop up till right before bed around 12 am and im up at 4-5 am	McNuttyNutz	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc2qa1	1492352547	I watch a lot of YouTube and Netflix. I play Pokémon Go, and use Amazon Music. I play a game called Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes  I hit 20-30% at about 3 pm, and I get up around 9.   Something is wrong lol	EpicShamwow	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc2qf2	1492352553	What's your typical use case? Any specific apps you use extensively?	Makegooduseof	t1_dgc2gul
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc2yh5	1492352897	I just use it. Before the afternoon is over my phone is already dead.  If I don't charge it at work, it won't be available during my commute back home.  I wake up with the phone at 100%. When I leave for work, it's at 90%. After my 100 minute commute, I arrive at the office with 65%. During the day it keeps dropping. When I leave at 6pm without charging it's dead or in single digits.	bighi	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc30ci	1492352979	Usage us normally 10-12 hours most apps use is reddit Netflix and apple music  facebook twitter	McNuttyNutz	t1_dgc2qf2
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc38uh	1492353346	That doesn't sound right whatsoever.  I get 9-12 hours SOT consistently and have never had to charge it twice a day.	michaelmanieri	t1_dgc2yh5
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc3bi0	1492353457	I think there are many factors that influence it. 4G vs Wifi, for example. How much you use it, what you use it for.  I also have it connected to my smartwatch and bluetooth headphones. Two devices constantly using energy.	bighi	t1_dgc38uh
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc3tfw	1492354228	I have two portable chargers on a rotation, so one of them is always fully charged, and I take it with me.	Toastwaver	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc424s	1492354590	Battery is usually dead by 5 or 6 pm with light use and standby in my pocket.  (A little exaggeration, but yeah, the battery is nothing special. I get the warning every day at about 7 pm, and phone is dead by 9 or 10. Biggest drain seems to be standby. I'll leave it alone for a while and come back to 15% less battery... worse than any Android I've owned since the Galaxy S3)	PeanutButterChicken	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc43r9	1492354657	That still doesn't sound right. Bluetooth shouldn't use a lot anymore (that used to be true until like the iPhone 5). I have mine constantly record my GPS through Moves connected to the Apple Watch and connected to a VPN but even when I'm using it a lot it's not draining that fast.   For example, according to my battery tab in settings I had 5 hours of usage since last night (I charge before bed) and 10 hours of standby, but I'm still at 50%.	_cortex	t1_dgc3bi0
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc48pm	1492354865	Standby uses barely nothing.  But the 50% after 5 hours is not far from what I'm getting.  After 1 hour and a half at home and almost two hours commuting, I'm at 65%. It isn't far from 50% when I get to 5 hours of usage (at 10am, maybe 11am). But I'm listening to podcasts from the moment I wake up, and my watch is not an Apple watch. Maybe that's why I'm using more of my battery.	bighi	t1_dgc43r9
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc4asn	1492354953	I found the best way to "conserve" battery is to turn off the battery percentage in the settings.   Suddenly it'll feel like it lasts twice as long ... especially since you won't obsess about the % that are left and check it all the time, which also helps with battery obviously.	_cortex	t1_dgc17ym
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc4cju	1492355026	Yeah that is a huge thing. I found that years ago. I am the same way. I will just constantly be glued to that percentage. The only reason I mentioned a percentage is because I only knew it was that low since power saved mode kicked on	JediSamReye2013	t1_dgc4asn
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc4pa8	1492355544	I think only once have I charged before I go to bed. I can get 10-12 hours usage time on a charge, which I rarely do. This phone is great.	djshack88	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc5238	1492356042	I was basing it on your other post where you said it drops from 90% to 65% after your 100 minute commute. That's a 25% drop, which apparently would take my phone (at 50% for 5 hours) 150 minutes. And like I said it's not like my phone has everything turned off or something, it's constantly checking GPS (which usually uses a shit ton), connected to Bluetooth devices, connected to a VPN, ... According to the battery tab most of this battery charge also went into a 1.5 hour FaceTime video call this morning, most other apps used way less (e.g. Narwhal for reddit was taking half of what FaceTime used for 2 hours of screen time).   All I'm saying is, maybe check your battery tab or something to see if something is unnecessarily running in the background and eating up battery (e.g. Facebook is a known offender in using background refresh / GPS privileges to run in the background for as long as possible). If not maybe your battery is bad, there's apps out there to check that too. I can count on one hand how many times my iPhone has been in the single digits or dead since I've had it even though I usually charge it only once per day - and I'm not what you would call a "light user", so a battery that's draining as fast as yours just sounds a bit off.	_cortex	t1_dgc48pm
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc55gc	1492356174	I actually charge twice per day.  Why? Simple, I wake up at 5 and do lots of gaming like (1 hour) 2 hours of Safari and 50 mins of Reddit.  Around 4PM I'm charging the phone because it's around 40%.  Then I use it till 35% which is by the time I'm usually home.  But this habit is gonna change soon because I'm getting a new car tomorrow! (Public transportation life makes you waste tons of battery)	MrGunny94	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc5bdl	1492356402	That really doesn't seem right. Have you tinkered with the background app refresh settings? Maybe go to an Apple Store and have them check the battery.	djshack88	t1_dgc424s
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc6wle	1492358570	I'm am Android user, and I'm pretty jealous of the standby battery. I used a iPhone 6 for a stint and it would last a very long time untouched. Using it however, saw the battery drain like any other phone for me. IPhone 7 any different?	wankthisway	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc720y	1492358783	Play Pokemon go for 20 minutes, that'll take care of that pesky battery.	rivalius13	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc76x2	1492358963	My battery isn't all that great. I'm at 24% and have been scrolling through Reddit for like 3 hours straight. Had my phone since it came out. I do not leave it charging at night and I usually let the phone die at least once a week	kgzmn	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc7dga	1492359202	I have never actually killed the battery on my 7plus or gotten the low battery warning. I don't watch netflix on it but I do play games.	whoamanwtf	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc8sbp	1492361079	Yeah your phone is broken. It should not be as bad as an old android like the S3. It outlasts even current androids...	Scithmal	t1_dgc424s
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc8u37	1492361143	Getting downvoted but personally, I believe that if a Phone's battery can outlast a teenagers usage, then the battery life is good.	ZeroBalance98	t1_dgc7ckw
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc909x	1492361370	It's funny you say that. My current phone is an iPhone 6S and I got that over the 6S+ because I thought I wouldn't use it very much. Boy was I mistaken.   But going back to your point, even on my 6S, when I leave it alone, the battery barely seems to deplete itself, but when it's on, I can see the bar shrinking.	Makegooduseof	t1_dgc6wle
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc92l9	1492361454	Why would you WANT to drain the battery to 0 at night?  Draining it fully is the worst thing you can do to a li-ion battery.	TIFUbyResponding	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgc9mmd	1492362148	I have it connected to my car and AirPods. I use Reddit, game, FB, it's open consistently. 9-12 hours.	michaelmanieri	t1_dgc3bi0
t3_65oujp	t1_dgcaewl	1492363187	I'm still new to my 7Plus, but it really depends on what I'm doing. The days I work I can easily get to (way too late) bedtime and still have 10-20%. If I use my iPhone to make music, which I do several days out of the week, apps like GarageBand and Korg Gadget can be pretty taxing, so I'll need a quick juice-up at some point. Overall, the battery life is not dissimilar to the SE I gave up for this beautiful beast, but I can do things like crank up the screen brightness or use GPS with fewer worries.

t3_65qv87	t3_65qv87	1492370489	Is there anyway I can buy the first iPhone (2G) now? I'd pay double the official original price if I have to	Anton31Kah	-1
t3_65oujp	t1_dgcg4j2	1492370787	To clarify, with almost all smartphones these days it's virtually impossible to fully drain the battery unintentionally.  When the phone turns itself off as a result of having low battery, it isn't doing this because the battery is empty - technically, it leaves a small charge available, to keep the battery healthy. So long as you don't continuously try to turn it on for a while in this state or leave it for a long time before charging it (batteries naturally discharge over time, even when not being used) the battery should be fine.	DatDeLorean	t1_dgcbxh8
t3_65qv87	t1_dgcg7sn	1492370903	I love the original iPhone and I had until 3 years ago when someone broke into my house and stole it with a couple of other things and lately I've seen some photos of it and now I miss it so I decided to buy it again no matter the price	Anton31Kah	t1_dgcg0u9
t3_65qv87	t1_dgcg9oq	1492370970	Nice! Well last I heard they are pretty expensive and a lot of fakes.	BuzakaSteve	t1_dgcg7sn
t3_65oujp	t1_dgcggcu	1492371209	The reason for this is unfortunately the result of Apple's obsession with making the phones as thin as possible.  The hardware and software is incredibly efficient, and is the reason why standby life is so much better than on Android devices. However, when you're actively using the phone optimisation can only take you so far - components have a certain power draw requirement when in use, and they all add up. For active use the most important thing is raw battery capacity - and that is unfortunately the iPhone's biggest stumbling point. Even the Plus models technically have a smaller battery capacity than your average Android phone - the normal model has almost *half* as much.	DatDeLorean	t1_dgc909x
t3_65oujp	t1_dgci3s2	1492373354	Do you have background app refresh off for Snapchat? I know Snapchat is a battery sucker so I've turned background app refresh off for it and a few other apps. My 7 Plus lasts surprisingly well for the day with watching YouTube, Snapchat, Reddit and Twitter.	purplemountain01	t1_dgc045c

t3_65oujp	t1_dgcoj5x	1492381779	It uses location even when you turn off background refresh. The only way I've found to stop it, is to force close in the app switcher after leaving the app. That kills the location usage immediately.	SpartanSK117	t1_dgci3s2
t3_65oujp	t1_dgcolcq	1492381864	Just play Pokémon Go with the Plus Bluetooth accessory. It'll drain so fast you'll think something is wrong.	Snuhmeh	t3_65oujp
t3_65oujp	t1_dgcopn4	1492382032	lol that is the complete opposite of what you're supposed to do. leaving it plugged in at night and not letting it die **is what you're supposed** to do. I've been doing that for the past 6 months and my capacity is still 100%.	iBen95111	t1_dgc76x2
t3_65oujp	t1_dgcow50	1492382277	Using a lot of unoptimized apps drains the battery fairly quickly. Also, the Alien Blue (discontinued) app for Reddit drains the battery kinda fast.   Otherwise, I don't think I could really drain the battery in a day. It's just that efficient for me.	windstrider13	t3_65oujp
t3_65mqzp	t1_dgcpevi	1492383000	Ah, no, nothing's cut off. iOS10's design philosophy very much "takes for granted" the increased screen size of the 6/6S/6+/6S+, but doesn't really 'do much' with it, it just creates more superfluous space between icons that results in icons being reduced in size for this to work on the SE.  The best way is to compare iOS9's control panel to iOS10's control panel. I have an iPhone 5 I left on iOS 9 and every time I go to use that thing I find myself easily preferring using its interface to some pre-10 tweaks.	CLENVENMETINS	t1_dgc2bnt

t3_65vd6y	t1_dgdh9y0	1492436028	Contrary to what some have claimed, battery life on a 6S can be worse than a 6. It has a smaller battery capacity and whilst it's more energy efficient that's more relevant for standby than active states. I doubt it's because the CPU is manufactured by company A instead of company B.	DatDeLorean	t1_dgdgnbv
t3_65vcaq	t1_dgdhgvb	1492436330	It's a good starting place, but not that equivalent. Over the course of a day, it'll probably be a good few hours higher than the total the screen was on for (especially true if you're listening to podcasts/music, plus normal things the phone does in the background like backup photos, refresh apps, etc)	redavid	t1_dgdfvhj

t3_65vcaq	t1_dgdq2xj	1492447083	I have taken some Extreme measures to save battery on my 7 plus, Battery saver enabled -&gt; location and bluetooth turned off -&gt; background app refresh turned off for all apps , mail fetch turned off etc.... During the testing phase I would charge the phone to 100% then use it till it hits 99% and this is where I would start logging the results, I used to measure how much SOT i was getting by consuming 1 percent of battery and it averages from 5 minutes to 7 depending on what you are doing. Since my phone does not wake up when its idle my SOT is almost same as the usage i confirm this by taking a screen shot when i go to sleep and then take a screen shot again when i wake up....usage is increased by 10-11 minutes during 9 hours of idle time. Now regarding the battery life, you can easily get 7-8 hours of ACTUAL screen on time + the idle consumption varies from 1 percent decline over 3 hours to 1 percent decline over 2 hours of standby hope this answers ur question. just to let u know auto birghtness is turned off i use the phone mostly indoor and the brightness is usually around 20%	_iOS	t3_65vcaq
t3_65vd6y	t1_dgduyjy	1492452478	Yeah. Knowing what I know now I should have done that. But too late now. I can't return it.	nightrhyme	t1_dgdpv0i
t3_65vd6y	t1_dgdvenp	1492452981	Sure you are right about that. But it is very suspicious that my device behaves exactly like described in so many forums and videos.   - Runs hot and has bad battery life.   I already read the article you link to. I must say I have zero trust in apples statement. Me and many 6s owners knows it is a lie.	nightrhyme	t1_dgdow5y
t3_65vcaq	t1_dgdwud6	1492454599	20 percent is pretty low. Regardless, thanks for the answer.	hirsh15	t1_dgdq2xj
t3_65qv87	t1_dgdxmx3	1492455499	Let me know.. Mines used without box and also in London ( Brent cross)	Clivelethbridge	t1_dgdalmf
t3_65vcaq	t1_dgdxnc9	1492455512	Damn, that's really good. Considering I'm use to 1-2 hrs of SOT, having 8 will be amazing.	hirsh15	t1_dgdniqe
t3_65vcaq	t1_dgdxoii	1492455548	Wow, that's amazing. That's 5 times my current SOT. :o	hirsh15	t1_dgdn3c3
t3_65vd6y	t1_dge5q44	1492464711	&gt; Runs hot and has bad battery life.  Sure and I'm not saying you're wrong about that. But that is probably because you had a bad chip and not just because you have a Samsung chip.	cooperred	t1_dgdvenp
t3_65vcaq	t1_dge6ido	1492465676	It's relative to your use. If you've ever used an s7 edge, and that only gets you 1-2 hours usage as well, then you can expect that the iPhone 7 plus will give you double that amount.	nemonicx	t1_dgdxnc9
t3_65vd6y	t1_dge74xz	1492466460	Yeah I haven't tested enough Samsung equipped 6s's to be absolutely sure about this. But it seems pretty convincing to me as I have spend entirely too much time reading various sites and forums about this issue. The correlating problems with the Samsung chip seems much too convincing to be just a matter of some bad chips.   I take it you have the TSMC ?	nightrhyme	t3_65vd6y
t3_65vcaq	t1_dgebl9l	1492472230	Odd, my 7 plus doesn't last me any longer than my s6 active did.	BababooeyHTJ	t1_dgdniqe
t3_65vd6y	t1_dgecpu6	1492473672	I have a great battery life on ios 10.2.1 with samsung chip, cant say the same when I was on 10.3.1.	tehcoon89	t3_65vd6y
t3_65vd6y	t1_dgedeqr	1492474562	Ok. Worth a try. So how did You manage to downgrade ?	nightrhyme	t1_dgecpu6
t3_65vcaq	t1_dgedhdp	1492474651	That's very surprising. I haven't tried the "active" variant, but the s6 had horrible battery life for me. I remember it draining 10-15% per hour not even using it and more than 20-30% when using it per hour. Id be scrambling for a charger by lunch time. The S7 edge really improved this and I'd be at 40-50% battery by lunch vs 0-25%. The note 7(RIP) was slightly better than the s7 Edge.   The 7 plus, under similar workload/phone use, would be at 70-80%.	nemonicx	t1_dgebl9l
t3_65vd6y	t1_dgejrx3	1492482330	You realize the battery in the 6 is physically larger then the battery in the 6s right?  There are plenty of other legitimate reasons you could be experiencing decreased battery life.	UsernamesAreHard26	t3_65vd6y
t3_65vd6y	t1_dgeuks6	1492501080	Well I just checked apple doesnt sign 10.2.1 anymore. You can check on ipsw.me.	tehcoon89	t1_dgedeqr
t3_65vd6y	t1_dgevrdc	1492504806	Yeah I read that too. Then I guess I just have the next update will make battery life better.	nightrhyme	t1_dgeuks6

t3_662x90	t3_662x90	1492523306	My Apple Lightning Connector causes the charge to my iPhone to stop then resume again when moving the cable in certain ways.	_Ryzm_	-1
t3_662x90	t1_dgfacct	1492530244	Most likely it's the cord that is damaged. If you have access to another lightning cable try that in your 7 plus and see if it works.	BLVARI	t3_662x90
t3_662x90	t1_dgfaqgq	1492530660	Cable could be on its way out or you could have lint build up in your port. Take both to an Apple Store and have them take a look.  Don't try to clean the port yourself. If you damage the pins you are responsible, if a technician at apple damages them, they are responsible.	Mrmustard17	t3_662x90
t3_65mqzp	t1_dgfbgog	1492531431	Of course however the phone must be purchased with a number and plan, you can swap Sims and lose the $30-$45 depending on when you buy it. 4/20 the base plan required for purchase with go to $45 instead of the $30 go phone plan	wuzzgud	t1_dgcylvj
t3_662x90	t1_dgfcz4h	1492533024	I clean the port by myself all the time. I wasn't aware you need to be careful. I literally stick a mini screw driver in there and dig all the dust and lint out, and it's good again.	BR0METHIUS	t1_dgfaqgq
t3_662x90	t1_dgfekac	1492534695	You absolutely have to be careful. There are raised pins inside, bend or break one and your phone is a brick.	Mrmustard17	t1_dgfcz4h
t3_662x90	t1_dgfesp9	1492534943	Thanks. I'll try to find a softer tool.	BR0METHIUS	t1_dgfekac
t3_65mqzp	t1_dgfhi0a	1492537818	So i have to pay 199 plus 45 and then i can cancel the go phone plan?	GustyAeroplane	t1_dgfbgog
t3_662x90	t1_dgfhufk	1492538183	Symptoms like that are usually a sign of a dirty charging port. I use a toothpick to gently clean out the lint that accumulates in there.	windstrider13	t3_662x90
t3_662x90	t1_dgflq0d	1492542357	I whittle a toothpick so the end is thin and frayed.	TripJammer	t1_dgfesp9
t3_65mqzp	t1_dgfom21	1492545448	Correct. It would auto cancel after the 30 day cycle if you didn't refill it	wuzzgud	t1_dgfhi0a
t3_662x90	t1_dgfp19c	1492545901	Definitely not a brick.. Charging ports are easy and cheap to replace	Ember_season	t1_dgfekac
t3_65mqzp	t1_dgft24o	1492550094	Sweet. So for 120 Ive got an iPhone SE that I can, on day one, swap my sim card in and use on my AT&amp;T plan. Thanks.	GustyAeroplane	t1_dgfom21
t3_662x90	t1_dgfuh9d	1492551667	I wouldn't advise anyone to repair their phone unless they know what they're doing, and someone who didn't know you have to be careful cleaning out your charging port, probably doesn't.  Likewise, I don't mess with anything aftermarket if it's part of the power (lightning port, battery, etc).  Lastly, I wouldn't want to take my 7 plus apart because you need to reapply the watertight gasket to ensure it is still water resistant.  Due to all that I'm speaking from what would happen if brought to apple. The whole phone would need to be replaced, because they do not replace charging ports.	Mrmustard17	t1_dgfp19c
t3_6663pa	t1_dgfwiw7	1492554130	Everything you read about the next iPhone is all rumors until September. There is supposed to be the 7s, 7s plus, and whatever the iPhone 8 will be called. The 8 is supposed to have the OLED screen. In September they hold an event announcing the iPhone's then usually that Friday they go up for preorder then about 2 weeks later they're fully released. But rumor has it the iPhone 8 may be delayed until later in the year.	djmexi	t3_6663pa
t3_6663pa	t1_dgfyiqq	1492556634	In years past the iPad event, as it's commonly called, usually happens in march. But this year one didn't happen because there wasn't a significant enough change.	djmexi	t1_dgfyfrf
t3_6663pa	t1_dgfzvtr	1492558355	Yeah they just did an iPad refresh last month so your good to buy one. Normally people advise to not buy an iPhone this close to a new release. Choice is yours on that one.	djmexi	t1_dgfzjjn
t3_6663pa	t1_dgg08mx	1492558804	Often it is this time of the year where they would do a discount or sales on the iPhones to clear the stocks for the coming announcement.  If anyone doesn't care about the "latest and newest", I would say the 7 to be a nice buy (even though it is still expensive in comparison to other phones, whatever though...)	naeads	t1_dgfzvtr
t3_6663pa	t1_dgg09yg	1492558849	They never do that. At least not in the US. Apple never has	djmexi	t1_dgg08mx
t3_6663pa	t1_dgg0r22	1492559440	Oh, sorry to hear that. I am living in Asia countries here, apple authorised sellers reduce around $100 this time of the year.	naeads	t1_dgg09yg
t3_6663pa	t1_dgg140z	1492559881	Not quite sure what the difference is. For me, an iPhone is an iPhone. Though I would love to know why people prefer buying directly from Apple?	naeads	t1_dgg0ygw
t3_6663pa	t1_dgg18n7	1492560038	Don't know really. I am also an Android user, so I don't pay much attention to aftersales service, if any, at all.	naeads	t1_dgg14yb
t3_666qf8	t1_dgg2b6q	1492561275	In my experience iPhones tend to keep their value for a long time, even when used. I'm not sure about other countries, but here in Brazil you find people selling a 16GB 5S for nearly the same as a new Galaxy S6 would be.	kadupse	t3_666qf8
t3_666qf8	t1_dgg35m2	1492562265	iPhones sell for way higher used if that's what you're asking.	tman2damax11	t3_666qf8
t3_666qf8	t1_dgg4l8a	1492563887	Indeed they're selling higher, but Androids start off cheaper, I jus wonder how much drop in % for the two camps	wifislow	t1_dgg35m2
t3_666qf8	t1_dgg4n4c	1492563949	Wow, that's really scary but iphones have constantly higher value?	wifislow	t1_dgg2b6q
t3_666qf8	t1_dggalzj	1492570850	It depends on what phones you're referring to. A Galaxy S or an LG G series phone will start at the same price as the iphone, but is in direct competition with it. There are budget phones, but they're not meant to go head to head with the iphone.	tman2damax11	t1_dgg4l8a
t3_666qf8	t1_dggd252	1492574131	Android flagships will typically be cheaper used than their older iPhone counterparts. (i.e, S7 can now be found for cheaper than a 6S in the same condition), LG V20 is around the price of a 6S Plus despite coming out a little later than the iPhone 7/7+	agarayze	t3_666qf8
t3_65vd6y	t1_dggec3c	1492576023	I have a Samsung chip on my 6s Plus and it lasts way longer than any other phone I ever had	kims681	t1_dgdvenp
t3_64rkr6	t1_dgggs2v	1492580359	Funny, I just got an iPhone 7 2 weeks ago and I just ordered a Commuter case for it off Amazon.  I'm hoping it isn't TOO bulky but I want more drop protection.  For a minimalist case I had the Air Prism by Ringke for a week now and it is a clear rubber (but not too grippy) with a 3D prism design on the back.  Very trim and thin.	RJForsc2	t3_64rkr6
t3_65vd6y	t1_dggmggo	1492595712	Happy for you. The plus versioner seems les affected.  My battery percentage counter acts like a rocket launch countdown. Lol it's just crazy.	nightrhyme	t1_dggec3c
t3_666qf8	t1_dggnsdi	1492599423	IPhone hold its value for much longer. I think mostly because they are supported for 5 years unlike android devices that become obsolete after barely 2 (by obsolete I mean no further updates). I owned good few androids and even the most expensive flagship only get ONE major update. I think the amount of Android manufacturers and device variety plays a big role in value drops too.	majnus	t3_666qf8

t3_669ko1	t1_dggz7wp	1492615721	I stopped using the News app.  At first, it was great.  All my nerdy geek news.  Then an update came along and I was pummeled with political and entertainment crap (Top Stories, Trending Stories) with no way to turn it off.  Stopped using it.  Which is a shame because I liked the way it aggregated stories.	vswr	t3_669ko1
t3_669ko1	t1_dgh06sb	1492616732	You can get rid of political articles and trendy stuff if you swipe on them and tap dislike. I literally don't get any of that stuff anymore.	vavyxray	t1_dggz7wp

t3_669ko1	t1_dgh2gd3	1492619088	You can change the alerts you get. I turned off almost all but a couple of specific news organizations alerts. Open app, tap favorites, then tap the bell symbol in the upper left corner. Choose which sources can send notifications.	StonewallBrown	t3_669ko1

I don't need my day interrupted with a notification.  I hate the news though! I'm trying to get rid of all the political stuff and it's impossible.

CNN is very bias when it comes to politics (favoring the left) as well as Fox (favoring the right).

t3_669ko1	t1_dghgx4c	1492634052	Interesting.  You don't find Huffington Post, ABC, and the New York Times to be biased??   Certainly you must, since CNN is demonstrably less biased by comparison.	GrainyNickel	t1_dghgrux

t3_669ko1	t1_dghhvqc	1492635030	I never said they weren't bias I was just giving an example of other news networks I watch. You wanted to know why he said viewing CNN and Fox is interesting  and I told you why.	WakaiSenshi	t1_dghgx4c

t3_669ko1	t1_dghinen	1492635849	Just seemed like you were due to the fact of you being so consistent trying to figure out what news sources I watch ever since I said that CNN and Fox have different biases.	WakaiSenshi	t1_dghijy8
t3_669ko1	t1_dghion0	1492635886	I've found it by googling it but when I go to download it the little cloud download button is grayed out.

t3_669ko1	t1_dghj4e9	1492636386	Wasn't really my thoughts I was just trying to help you understand other people's thoughts. If I thought CNN or Fox was biased why would I still count on them for everyday news?	WakaiSenshi	t1_dghir8j

t3_669ko1	t1_dghkvdt	1492638421	A suggestion. Turn off notifications for the individual apps, I did a long time ago. I just keep them for love video	itshukokay	t3_669ko1
t3_669ko1	t1_dghnxpy	1492642158	But notifications as a whole on Android are much easier to manage and work with. All texts get bunched into one notification, then you can open that up and see the texts. All Facebook notifications get bunched together, Twitter gets put together, etc. It's significantly easier to manage than the chronological clusterfuck that is iOS notifications.	zar1234	t1_dgh7d8g

t3_669ko1	t1_dghu4h8	1492649920	I like it for push notifications, because I can see how they are covering events. But I never actually spend time reading them.	RedditIsJustAwful	t1_dghbueq
t3_669ko1	t1_dghvijc	1492651619	No it isn't. Its someone in prison who committed suicide after murdering someone. Nobody needs to hear about this. Its irrelevant.	aspoels	t1_dghu7si
t3_669ko1	t1_dghw5tz	1492652385	He was accused of murdering 3 people, and the one he was convicted of killing was allegedly to cover up the initial two murders. He then killed himself in prison after his acquittal for the earlier crime. That is newsworthy, whether or not he was a celebrity. And, even disregarding the fact that he was a convicted murderer, celebrity deaths always receive coverage, whether you like it or not. He was a public figure. You cannot argue against that. It is a multifaceted story that probably affected many lives, and also ultimately reflects on the current state of the scandal-plagued NFL. We are talking about a multi-billion dollar industry here.  Your personal preferences do not determine newsworthiness. The fact that every major publication covered this story proves that you are wrong. You can complain all you want about the state of the media but that will never change human behavior and what events matter to people.	RedditIsJustAwful	t1_dghvijc
t3_669ko1	t1_dghwd6s	1492652628	Apparently people give a shit about this worthless crap. Whatever.	aspoels	t1_dghw5tz

t3_669ko1	t1_dgi0yz0	1492658222	This is a perfect example of why I just laugh when people do puff pieces on how adblockers will kill online advertising, and "journalism" will die. I mean, how many organizations do we need, all publishing and airing the exact. same. thing. AP and UP do most of the reporting, and then CNN, CBS, ABC, and NBC embellish it a little, and repeat it ad nauseam, to say nothing of the 24-hour talking heads all parroting the same things, and adding absolutely no value to the world. (And don't get me started with the propaganda-like brainwashing by late night "comedians" owned by the same companies.)  It's like Apple "news" sites. How much original content is there?  Yet literally dozens of sites are in the business of selling advertising to print the same, stupid, unsubstantiated rumors and speculations. Some of these organizations and sites *should* die.  All the people who complain about "FAUX NEWS" and the NY Post ought to be glad there's at one company (News Corp) that takes a *slightly* different tack on the news of the day. It's 4-to-1 out there, and I'd be happy for some more diversification. Otherwise, you may as well collapse Comcast, Disney, TW, and National Amusements into one organization, for all the diversity of view they offer.	DunkirkReadOnly	t3_669ko1
t3_669ko1	t1_dgi1292	1492658341	I like the numbers instead of dots for signal.   I also haven't looked into how to turn field test off.	aar123mcl	t1_dghsm0s
t3_669ko1	t1_dgi1641	1492658479	Problem is, I still like to get news, actual news. If Apple wants to be a news aggregator, they should realize when sending out notifications which stories are duplicates to avoid sending them many times.	aar123mcl	t1_dgh2skr

t3_669ko1	t1_dgi60o2	1492666165	I deleted the app when I couldn't remove the section that showed me millions of articles about Apple products. Just because I use an Apple phone doesn't mean I give a shit about the company.	Rickerus	t3_669ko1
t3_669ko1	t1_dgi615v	1492666193	Ya have to intentionally turn field test numbers on. Doesn't happen on accident when it's your status bar. It's even easier to turn off. Just go back into field test and click home.	insertnamehere987	t1_dgi1292
t3_669ko1	t1_dgi7np5	1492669793	Fun fact: in countries which doesn't have the news app (like Sweden) you still have the widget. So you get a news ticker, but no way to configure it. Makes it suuuper useful...	JarlJarl	t1_dggr0pq
t3_669ko1	t1_dgialce	1492677888	I come from a country where Apple news is not available. Strange that we get a Widget for News but not the app. Links just open the respective website in Safari.	buckbuckgo	t3_669ko1
t3_669ko1	t1_dgibyvu	1492682264	lol same. I had to disable notifications for the app. So needy	itsmegeorge	t3_669ko1
t3_669ko1	t1_dgidjsb	1492686638	Right. I knew that turning it on had to be intentional, because I did that a few months ago. I just like having it on for the signal meter change. Unless it affects phone operation, which after using for months does not appear to be the case.	aar123mcl	t1_dgi615v
t3_669ko1	t1_dgidmn5	1492686825	No need to feel sorry for me. I also have huffpo, drudge, msnbc. I also follow Trump's twitter feed to see his twist when the news comes out.  I like to see stories from every which way, and draw my own conclusion from the consistent portions of what is reported.	aar123mcl	t1_dghhvio
t3_669ko1	t1_dgidotk	1492686966	If I manage the notifications, then some of the places won't send any.  CNN does have an adjustable setting, but Fox only has an on/off toggle for breaking news. In Apple News, it seems that I can only have on/off for breaking news as well.  If apple wants to be a news aggregator, they should have a smart way to notify us of headlines and tag it as multiple sources, then take us to the stories.	aar123mcl	t1_dghspx4

t3_669ko1	t1_dgir70c	1492705155	To some extent they are all full of shit though. Everyone has their own slant on the news in our hyper partisan world. It's just a matter of does the slant match our own opinion, and therefore is it or isn't it full of shit.	aar123mcl	t1_dgil15v
t3_669ko1	t1_dgiygkh	1492712881	Nope. Sounds odd, wish I could help! I would suggest turning app notifications off but not sure if you have the app programmed to send you other notifications as well or not.	chinastevo	t1_dgh87az

t3_65vcaq	t1_dgqo2eb	1493146549	Is that actual SoT or usage time?   Usage time includes apps running in the background during standby (e.g. Music apps etc), which obviously doesn't count towards SoT.   Apple don't actually show SoT so it's a pain in the arse to get a reliable figure.	newfonehudis	t1_dgdn3c3

t3_63x6ge	t1_dgr2biu	1493163015	The home button/touchID cable is a part of the screen assembly on a 6s. I have seen defective 6s screens where the home button will work but he Touch ID won't. It's possible changing the screen will resolve that issue, if the cable on the screen is in fact the causal variable in your Touch ID not working. It could also be that the home buttons was replaced before in which case it'll never work.	chizzled_booty	t3_63x6ge
