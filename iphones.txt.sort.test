t3_6bbgdt	t1_dhlchv1	1494871202	Could be bad battery or the sensor needs resetting. My 5s used to do this and then stay on 1% for ages. Try wearing the battery completely down and then recharging all the way back to 100% without interruption. That can sort it sometimes.	slybob	t1_dhlc80h
t3_6bbgdt	t1_dhlck9f	1494871278	Okay. I'll try,   Do you know the cost of replacing a out of warranty battery?	devopia	t1_dhlchv1

t3_6bcuag	t1_dhlqqs1	1494887924	I want to upgrade later this year and was *very* tempted with the matte black but I've had a Gold iPhone 5s and now a 6s and I really like it. I'd miss the gold if I didn't have it. It's just a nice device to look at in that colour. Even as a guy, I love the Gold.	examinati0n	t3_6bcuag
t3_6bcuag	t1_dhltp6d	1494891864	Red! I just got mine Saturday and I love it!! Everyone has the rose gold so I wanted something different.	a_cuppy_can	t3_6bcuag
t3_6bcuag	t1_dhlx7qz	1494896418	Seconded. Jet black was so hard to take care of. I kept it in a case every day, even cleaned the phone and inside of the case all the time to try and prevent microabrasions. Still scratched to hell.	lauradiamandis	t1_dhlli66
t3_6bcuag	t1_dhlxnnn	1494896979	Hell yeah! Nothing can protect it. I regret buying it. It's not worth having a phone that is trap in a case.	Bigchile789	t1_dhlx7qz
t3_6bcuag	t1_dhm1hil	1494901760	It looks good for the first couple of weeks... once the scratches come, it all changes.	Bigchile789	t1_dhm1f3t
t3_6bcuag	t1_dhm1vss	1494902241	If I was getting a 7, I'd have to go with the Project Red one. I picked up the red leather case for my SE and I love it, but it'd be nicer to have a fully red phone. I think it'd look nicer if the Red 7 had a black front though.	EBOLANIPPLES	t3_6bcuag

t3_6bgymw	t1_dhmkez9	1494940587	I would NOT recommend at all. I understand it's cheaper to fix it on your own but for a better of safety, I would go into Apple Store to have them replace the phone.	cmbf4	t1_dhmhbr7
t3_6bgymw	t1_dhmkji1	1494940763	I hope so! Going to an Apple Store today	klimtom	t1_dhmhyfa
t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhmkn7m	1494940904	Widgets are probably my least favourite part of iOS right now.    Don't get me wrong, the ones I use tend to function rather well, I don't have issues with mine at least...And I can live with the fact they're all on one page, that doesn't bother me. But I hate that they all look the same. I don't mind the notification style of iOS 10 but I can't stand the white background on *every* widget. I'd love to see widgets get their look per app. I don't think they should all conform to the same style of the white background - it's uniform but lacks...Personality. I'd nearly prefer they were iOS 9 style tbh.	examinati0n	t3_6bh9s3
t3_6bgymw	t1_dhmm9ek	1494943010	I had exactly the same problem with my iPhone 5 2 months ago. Went to the Apple Store and was offered a brand new iPhone 5 for the price of the new battery.	231elizabeth	t3_6bgymw
t3_6bbgdt	t1_dhmoi3b	1494945669	Yes I have this problem also. It only last for about 4 hours. From 100-20 which is when I usually charge it.	Vgutierrez96	t1_dhl822l

t3_6bgymw	t1_dhmq0yi	1494947353	I got a battery and tool kit off of ifixit for $20. Replaced it myself in under 30 minutes. 5/5 would recommend.	gotlactose	t3_6bgymw
t3_6bgymw	t1_dhms1ro	1494949540	Funny enough, I've done exactly what you're doing for the same reason. I got a kit off of iFixit. So if the Apple Store doesn't do it for free, I'd recommend that. It's crazy easy and iFixit usually has good quality parts.  *Edit:* Or I mean if the Apple Store will swap ya for the price you'd pay anyway just do that.	treyf711	t3_6bgymw
t3_6biarn	t3_6biarn	1494950032	The Most Truth I have Seen with this Spongebob Meme going around.	RiverFenixBen	-1
t3_6biarn	t1_dhmtrt1	1494951375	I think the second part after "Android users" is making fun of the fact that Android does not have iMessage, only SMS. Older androids and dumb phones have a text limit (or maybe it was an old carrier limit? idk I've always been a talker not a texter), so it breaks the long text into multiple texts like 1/3, 2/3, 3/3. And the pixelated pic is making phone of the fact android has inferior cameras.  The reality is, pre Lollipop days everyone either bought an iphone, samsung, or a POS cheap android phone. So majority of androids did have terrible cameras. But today most android phones are actually really great, and all have decent cameras. But there are still a ton of android users out there on old phones with potato cameras so the meme lives on. (Just look at android adoption rates, most people a years behind). It also doesn't help that Snapchat sucks on android, making it look like every android camera sucks.  hopefully i was correct. as for this meme in general, I don't really find it funny. definitely not my favorite of this year  edit: I don't think android has inferior cameras, that is what I thought the meme was suggesting because it's a popular opinion. Please remember that we are a minority - most people don't know what the hell a Pixel or OnePlus is. They don't know what image processing is, they don't know what makes a good camera. All they know is their friends Galaxy Note 3 looks like dog crap, so all androids must be crap. The majority of android users are on older devices.	dackwarbs	t1_dhmsz5o
t3_6biarn	t1_dhmtvne	1494951487	If an android user sends you a rather long text, it will get broken up into pieces. Many times the pieces will be broken up out of order.   Then with sending pictures or videos, they will be extremely pixelated. For me, pictures are fine. But videos are unwatchable.	The_dooster	t1_dhmsz5o
t3_6biarn	t1_dhmu6c7	1494951809	An old played out meme about Androids having shitty cameras. Far from the truth anymore as pretty much any current, midrange to high end Android device has a more than fine camera.	SoapboxJunkie	t1_dhmsz5o
t3_6biarn	t1_dhmun9t	1494952306	actually the picture thing isnt so much about the camera but about their MMS issues...I have a Android for my business phone...and anytime I have to pass a picture to someone or vice-versa...the quality of the picture gets so degraded...so no matter what quality the camera takes a picture of...whatever gets sent still looks like crap.	RiverFenixBen	t1_dhmtrt1
t3_6biarn	t1_dhmv0re	1494952704	&gt; The reality is  &gt; today most android phones are actually really great, and all have decent cameras  and cameras really don't have anything to do with it these days, it's the software that's processing the image. If we're looking at current android vs iphone flagships, I think it's all subjective.	dackwarbs	t1_dhmuemb
t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhmvdbi	1494953072	I'm bothered more by the weird iOS 10 card design than I am by the widgets themselves. I do wish that they would at least get to customize their header bar beyond just including the app icon and name.	james_honey_comby	t1_dhmkn7m
t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhmw5y7	1494953906	It's a widget, but it's not a widget.	trepap	t3_6bh9s3

t3_6biarn	t1_dhmyz3i	1494956861	Share with Google Photos. It handles how pictures and videos are sent to the person whether they are a contact or not.	vainsilver	t1_dhmun9t
t3_6biarn	t1_dhmyzql	1494956881	&gt; android has inferior cameras  [ahem](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-pixel-vs-iphone-7-plus-which-camera-is-better/)  Point taken that the cameras have sucked with android phones for a while though.	adepssimius	t1_dhmtrt1
t3_6biarn	t1_dhmz3wx	1494957004	It's not about cameras, it's about image compression. iMessage doesn't compress images while MMS does, which reduces the quality of the received image.  At least, that was my interpretation. Can't speak for whoever created the meme.	LodvicKerman	t1_dhmu6c7
t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhmzdvt	1494957294	What annoys me is just how absolutely buggy every single widget is. Often times the text is just jumbled and piled on top of itself. Not to mention the entire widgets page just lags and doesn't often refresh properly.  I also maintain the thought that sidelining them to an awkward drawer in the notification center makes widgets all but worthless. They need to be on the home screen.	alwaysrebooting	t3_6bh9s3
t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhn1pil	1494959800	We have widgets? I've never been able to find one even after downloading it, they just disappear.	nnjb52	t3_6bh9s3
t3_6biarn	t1_dhn4vxg	1494963261	Does the other person have to have Google Photos.	BrownsFanZ	t1_dhmyz3i
t3_6bgymw	t1_dhn580c	1494963624	It depends on how comfortable you are opening up the phone. You can do it yourself for about $20 with a kit off Amazon, or you can have Apple do it for about $60 more.	n_alvarez2007	t3_6bgymw

t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhn66qg	1494964669	I use the weather, calendar, and Shazam widgets all the time and have no issues with them.  On the lock screen it's a quick swipe to the left and the info I want is there.	RandomUser03	t3_6bh9s3
t3_6bjs3r	t1_dhn6es1	1494964919	It is very safe to use, however I've heard some horror stories about banks refusing to cover fraud because you gave an unauthorized third party (Mint) your password, even though the two were completely unrelated.      Check the agreement you have with your financial institutions to make sure you're protecting yourself.	BravoRomeo2	t3_6bjs3r
t3_6bjs3r	t1_dhn6fxu	1494964954	Interesting. Thanks for sharing. Do you use the app?	DoctorQuinlan	t1_dhn6es1
t3_6bjs3r	t1_dhn6nky	1494965184	I have used it. When I read into my bank contract I saw that I wouldn't be covered for giving them access to my account, so to be safe I stopped using it and changed my password.      I was 100% confident in Mint's safety and privacy, I just didn't want my bank to turn around and blame them for something unrelated, should it happen. I should mention that I don't live in the US and Mint wasn't available for all of my financial products either, so it wasn't a hard decision to stop using it.	BravoRomeo2	t1_dhn6fxu
t3_6bjxai	t3_6bjxai	1494965539	I cleaned my camera lens, but when I put my iPhone 6 back together my screen is all messed up and unresponsive.	CapAWESOMEst	-1
t3_6bjs3r	t1_dhn73ml	1494965673	Mint is owned by Intuit, a large and generally reputable company.  There's of course risk in giving third-parties the usernames and passwords to your bank or credit card accounts, but some banks will let you use 'access codes' or 'app specific passwords' that will only give services like Mint read-access to specific data to lower the risk.  I don't use it myself, but know plenty of people that do without issue and find the service useful.	redavid	t3_6bjs3r
t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhn75dw	1494965725	How so? I have about ~10 widgets that I use pretty much every day, and I couldn't imagine using my phone without em now that I've gotten so used to them.	throwawayvita	t3_6bh9s3
t3_6bjs3r	t1_dhn7jpr	1494966152	I used it for a bit, added all my accounts, looked around a bit, then removed it all.  Eh, wasn't too useful for me.  Some of my accounts kept getting sync issues.  Got tired of babysitting it.  Felt kinda weird giving access to all my financial accounts to a 3rd party website.	snowgrammer	t3_6bjs3r
t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhn7n2u	1494966254	There are on a home screen, just swipe right. They just don't allow them to be on a screen among your icons.	x3n0n1c	t1_dhmzdvt
t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhn7p6n	1494966318	They're in the status bar on the left page. Go down to the bottom for settings	flashisflamable	t1_dhn1pil

t3_6bjxai	t1_dhn87u9	1494966886	Maybe. Did you just get a new screen?	CapAWESOMEst	t1_dhn84nw
t3_6bjxai	t1_dhn89k1	1494966938	If the board is scratched you'd need a new board or phone. I don't know where to buy a board alone in the US but other places have them.	cormeistro	t1_dhn87u9
t3_6bjxai	t1_dhn9gmd	1494968256	I suppose you could try a new screen and see if the issue resolves. That'd be the only way I know to test it.	cormeistro	t1_dhn8j9g

t3_6bcuag	t1_dhn9spw	1494968640	&gt;Condition of Financed iPhone When Exercising your Upgrade Option.    &gt;As noted above, your Financed iPhone must be in good physical and operational condition when exercising your Upgrade Option as determined solely by Apple or Apple’s trade-in service provider (“Trade-In Service Provider”).  For a Financed iPhone to be considered in good physical and operational condition, the Financed iPhone must:  &gt; 1. Power on and hold a charge;  &gt; 2. Have an intact and functioning display;  &gt; 3. Have no breaks or cracks; and  &gt; 4. Have Activation Lock disabled (you may be asked to disable at the time of upgrade).  &gt;If exercising your Upgrade Option via apple.com, you must also remove the SIM card prior to returning the original Financed iPhone.  [Source](https://www.apple.com/legal/sales-support/iphoneupgrade_us/)   ------  If I understand the terms correctly, yes.

t3_6bcuag	t1_dhn9z1j	1494968842	Jet black is beautiful, but be prepared for the inevitable scratches. I don't use a case, so I know mine will look like hell, but personally I think the scratches add character to the phone. [This image](http://i.imgur.com/cNjV2FW.jpg) from /u/polygonarsenal does a great job of showing off what I'm talking about.	ggKevin	t3_6bcuag
t3_6bcuag	t1_dhna08e	1494968880	Okay. Can't wait until the iPhone 8 comes and I see all of the jet black colors be denied.	Bigchile789	t3_6bcuag
t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhna67q	1494969070	just depends on which ones you use, how you use it IMO. just like anything else.	bbllaakkee	t1_dhn75dw
t3_6bgymw	t1_dhnafq4	1494969380	I did! But it will not be a *brand new* phone, but a refurbished one. That's their policy - apparently. However, the warranty will apply again!	klimtom	t1_dhmye24
t3_6bjxai	t1_dhnavmn	1494969898	Yeah, sounds like the only option. I'll get a new screen ASAP.	CapAWESOMEst	t1_dhn9gmd
t3_6bjxai	t1_dhnbyst	1494971183	If you know someone who also has one, you could perhaps barter to allow you to try their screen with your hardware.	Kenitzka	t1_dhnavmn
t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhnc1iu	1494971276	The fact that they share space with notifications make them useless to me.   I'm hoping that the new iPhone has a "virtual home button" and then uses the dead space around it for notifications, sort of the way that the old WebOS did. Then widgets can live in the pull down tray and maybe be sort of useful.	mrgreen4242	t3_6bh9s3
t3_6bjxai	t1_dhnc2pe	1494971314	Take a microscope* and verify al the pin connectors for the digitizer and the LCD are in good condition. Make sure you get a good, solid snap connection between the ribbon and the board.  Edit: *magnifying lens.	Kenitzka	t3_6bjxai
t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhnc8dy	1494971499	Wait, are you not going to bother backing up your point? Because I LOVE widgets on iPhone. The way Android handles widgets is a mess. You have to plan your whole homescreen around what widgets you want. The information density of Android widgets is terrible. It's almost impossible to have more than 1-2 widgets per page so you're constantly swiping around. The design language of widgets on Android is completely inconsistent. You can ONLY access them from the homepage.   iOS widgets are so much more useable. You can swipe down anywhere in iOS to see them (including from the lock screen), the design is consistent, everything is contained in a single scrollable pulldown. I regularly use 5-10 widgets (depending on what I've go going on) and they're pretty much indispensable for me now.	EndlessBuffoonery	t3_6bh9s3
t3_6bjxai	t1_dhndws7	1494973544	Haha, yes. Microscope might be overkill, but I can definitely get a magnifying glass. Thanks!	CapAWESOMEst	t1_dhnc2pe

t3_6bjs3r	t1_dhnhj5a	1494978225	Remember that the company behind Mint is Intuit, they are the makers of TurboTax, QuickBooks, and a bunch of other commercial POS and credit processing services.   I would trust them. I used to use the app all the time, now I just stopped caring since I try to memorize my finances.	crisss1205	t1_dhn640c
t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhni1p4	1494978906	I feel like an idiot. But I didn't realize I could just easily pull down the notification bar and swipe right to get to them. I would always go home first and then swipe right. Similar to my Tinder routine.   Thanks!	speeduponthedamnramp	t1_dhnc8dy

t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhnqvzr	1494989553	It's obviously not. It's the onlyu good widget system ever implemented on any device. Widgets in Windows Vista were terrible. Widgets on MacOS are not particularly useful and never have been. Androids widget system is an embarrassing joke. Widgets on iOS are pretty useful, attractive and functional.

t3_6bl60h	t1_dhnt7zg	1494992690	It's a fancy material yes, but how is the durability? I'd imagine on something to be thin enough for an iPhone wrap, it'd be very easy to wear it down. Supercar's Alcantara doesn't have to be thin so it doesn't get destroyed with use.	trill-chino	t1_dhnn1ow
t3_6bm8is	t1_dhntaja	1494992793	Wallpapers may be different across different devices and iOS versions. For example, today's 10.3.3 update seems to have added three new wallpapers, but only on the 12.9" iPad Pro.	aldrinjtauro	t3_6bm8is

t3_6bny3x	t1_dho4sk3	1495020009	Here! Bought mine on April 2016 (when it came out in my country) and never wore a case. The front glass is pretty much in Near Mint condition, despite a few scratches here and there, but are so light that you only notice them if you look really closely and with the phone turned off. The aluminium not so great, though... Survived 2 big drops and has 2 dents on it (my 4S fell way more and had no dent whatsoever) and the corners are almost like grinded, with aluminium removed. Probably to make it lighter they used softer aluminium that doesn't last that long. The back is filled with scratches, but nothing major.  I'll post pictures of it later, just gotta take them with another phone.	Gouranga547	t3_6bny3x

t3_6bny3x	t1_dho4wfk	1495020250	Bought the phone on launch, dropped it the first day lol so I have a tiny, tiny nick on the bottom left of the phone. Asides from that I gave up cases months ago, phone is still in excellent condition. Screen wise yeah there's some small light scratches on the screen but that's typical and nothing major.   It's held up quite well and I'm sure it will continue to do so over the next couple years.	plyboult	t3_6bny3x
t3_6bny3x	t1_dho4wt4	1495020274	I have an iPhone 6 that has been caseless since I bought it 2.5 years ago.   Honesty it still looks almost as new. There are a few minuscule scratches on the screen but it takes great effort to see those.	53bvo	t3_6bny3x

t3_6bl60h	t1_dhoe2i5	1495033429	its actually exactly the thickness of the iphone bump. Its not like their other super thin wraps.  Ive used the natural leather one, which is the same thickness, for years and havent had an issue with it wearing out.	talones	t1_dhnt7zg

t3_6bl60h	t1_dhoilf4	1495038345	In that case it should be durable. I'd imagine it's about the same as the leather since they're similar, but is the iPhone 7 camera bump different in size than the 7 Plus? Because imo the 7 Plus bump is massive for what it is and I don't think I'd like it to be that thick.	trill-chino	t1_dhoe2i5
t3_6bjs3r	t1_dhok2ok	1495039917	You need to decide what paranoia level you want to have. Of the highest: You really shouldn't have a cell phone at all if you want to be safer. Next, no third party apps on your phone.  If you're asking if Mint is safe in the general sense then yes, it's as safe as one can reasonably expect.  Is it 100% completely safe? No but neither is having a phone with a battery.  You aren't clear in communicating your fears though and set the bar pretty high with "completely safe" to the point the only reasonable answer is it's not completely safe (but neither is most anything). It's absolutely possible they lose credentials one day so you need to *seriously* ask yourself what a bad person can do with **just** your login to your bank and such.  If, however, you're wanting to know if there's something fishy about it -- then no, it's perfectly fine and backed by a large company.  It's absolutely not strange they go into all your expenses and store data. **That's the point of the app**.  Do you think it's strange GMail stores emails? If so then this app likely isn't for you then.  I use the app (and website) personally. The risks aren't that high and if something were to happen I'd simply change my passwords everywhere. It's not like any of my banks have my full on credit card picture and +3 to someone could steal it.	PM_ME_ALL_THE_BOOBIE	t3_6bjs3r

t3_6bq35a	t1_dholssy	1495041772	I haven't had a Macbook in years and I have an iPhone. I have no issues getting music on there, but I use iTunes on Windows so that might be a problem for you if you only use Ubuntu and Chrome OS. iPhone is not like Android where you just plug it in and drag files and explore everything so you may not like that if you're used to using your phone like it's an external hard drive. But there's no reason for me to leave this comment since the 8(or 7s) isn't going to bring back the headphone jack.	PavelDatsyuk	t3_6bq35a
t3_6bny3x	t1_dhomnpn	1495042697	I've been using my 5s without a case since the day I got it how ever many years ago. Only just now having touch screen issues, but that is to be expected with the amount of use it has acquired over the years.	FFNF	t3_6bny3x
t3_6bq35a	t1_dhool6k	1495044814	I've had no issues. I use a third party application called [MediaMonkey](http://www.mediamonkey.com/information/free/#convert) to transfer music instead of iTunes, which is just a personal preference, though. It works with all of my phones/iPods/iPhones. I have a lot of Google's apps installed on my iPhone as well, even though my current daily driver is a Pixel XL, and has primarily been Android for a while, Google makes integration fairly easy. There shouldn't be anything to worry about.	thegrand-lotus	t3_6bq35a
t3_6bq35a	t1_dhor7u4	1495047620	iTunes is just utter crap unless you've been following it for years.  Jump in from new and it's horrendous.  I'm no longer too bothered about owning physical music so Spotify fits the bill for me.	sneijder	t3_6bq35a
t3_6bq35a	t1_dhortp8	1495048288	Recently switched to a 5c from Samsung Android which I've been using for years. I still use Windows and never it'll change. Thing is, people use computers for very different things and so do phones, only there are similarities to using phones but not computers.   Eg. I was very used to the open source nature of Android which meant I could port files in and out easily between my computer and phone. Now with an iPhone, it's 10x harder because Apple prefers the "make everything shiny, don't let them see the inside". An iPhone solves what it was meant out to do, and does so very well. But it leaves more to be desired. Especially if you love bodging/third party stuff.  Also, Mac computers are too expensive for what you get. On a Windows, I can do so many things that I can't on a Mac (gaming comes to mind, so do third party things). I would like to have an iMac just for it's power, although I could just build one. In short, I think the integration is a gimmick to me, nothing more. A lot of Apple's demographic are "tech savvy" 20 and 30 year olds, and they work on the go a lot. Even though I'm at that demographic, I don't use my phone for much so I don't see the point of that integration.  Drawbacks sans Mac? I think iTunes does the trick but I get what you're saying. It's pretty shitty that you can't just move shit to your phone when you want it. In saying that, I could get all my pictures from my old phone to my iPhone via iCloud so that might be fine. Music on the other hand, Spotify works well but if you were talking to me 2 years ago, when I preferred ~~pirating~~ downloading music, I'd have a bad time. It seems impossible. Oh Apple...

t3_6bh9s3	t1_dhot7zd	1495049783	I feel there should be a way to place a widget on the home screen, to take up 2 rows of app icons. That would be really useful. Sad that we are talking about this when Android has had this for years.	loganluther	t3_6bh9s3

t3_6bq35a	t1_dhoyryo	1495055780	I like my iPhone! I use primarily Android and Windows, but the iPhone makes for a really smooth user experience. Swiping back and forth for webpage functions is great, and because Apple controls everything my phone usually runs like a charm.  The issue, though, is... Apple controls everything. I can't create dynamic wallpapers or access my file structure easily to unzip things or natively read a PDF. My music has to go through a program and customizing ringtones is a lot of work instead of just snipping it and throwing it into a folder.  It's a great phone, but I run into quirks here and there that get rather frustrating since I like using my phone as a mini computer.	tinyhipsterboy	t3_6bq35a

Anyone know if these used ones will be dropping in price with the next iPhone?  I'm guessing they would kinda have to, everyone with a 6/7 that wants the 8 is going to sell theirs, the market should flood out with 6/7 phones on the cheap.

I really don't use a smartphone, I just develop apps for one.  The speed is an issue for most users, but devs actually want to slower ones because that tells them how it'll work on the slower machine.

t3_6bswgx	t1_dhpi4bi	1495080245	You say youre an app developer, so you'd want a 7 ideally, at least for the latest stuff and future proof. But iPhone SE is the best price for the money.	Starwind_	t3_6bswgx
t3_6bswgx	t1_dhpji2n	1495082551	Although the iPhone 5 and 5C technically support iOS 10, my recommendation to you would actually be to get _at least_ the iPhone 5s— The 5s was the first iPhone with a 64-bit chip, meaning you'll be testing something more like what most people are using now. I'm guessing it will also be more future-proof for that reason.  But the 6s is the bare-minimum if you want to see how awesome 3D Touch is.	adamsak	t3_6bswgx

t3_6bswgx	t1_dhpmoyg	1495089164	It might seem that way on the surface, but really a dev doesn't need the latest device for testing.  Testing is to see how it works with the lowest memory and slowest chip...  It would be nice to have the pressure touch stuff and latest BT... but the sim can take care of those things and most of the work is in the code not on the device.  Devs really need a computer that compiles fast and can handle a lot of programs at the same time.  It's costly to keep up with all the changes Apple puts out.  I would take a 7 if it were at the $14/mo without contract.  I thought Apple was doing something to help people buy off contract.  Best Buy wants some 25% interest rate on their card... I think Apple could do well to offer something like the $14/mo for a new iPhone, there's a LOT of people that just don't need the full service.	KarlJay001	t1_dhpi4bi

t3_6c7xm6	t1_dhsva9x	1495262407	Correct. 3D Touch = input available in x, y and z axis simultaneously. Force touch you can only press harder in one spot.  Edit: to those who do not understand it, when you invoke the 3D Touch gesture to switch apps, you press harder on the left border and drag to the right. You have the (x, y) coordinates of where the touch occurs, plus the z value for pressing down on the screen. This is not a Force Touch gesture - it's a 3D Touch gesture.	vantt1	t1_dhsuk5q

t3_6cbvan	t1_dhtga94	1495305115	The easiest way I've seen that's straightforward is to download Google photos on both devices, but sync the app on your mom's S4 first along with using her Google account to sign in. It should allow you to select which folders to back up and you can do it over wifi or cell connection. Depending on how many photos she has, it may take some time. But let the S4 do its thing while it's plugged in for charging. You don't want it to die while doing so. Once it's done, sign in with same Google account that was on th S4 and all of your moms photos should be there. Ready to view.	shartofwar82	t3_6cbvan

t3_6cbvan	t1_dhu4f3z	1495342933	I know you asked for data transfer. But  in my opinion, the best option out of everything is get an external hard drive now from Amazon and transfer everything to that HDD via your laptop or PC.   Nothing beats a hard backup like this.   Also, if you haven't used Amazon prime before, get a trial account for free and buy that hard drive now and have it delivered to tomorrow.	naeads	t3_6cbvan

t3_6cgmde	t1_dhugeaz	1495374817	I recommend the mophie cases. You can control when you turn on the battery.  I think anker also makes a line as well with a switch.   Edit: seems I forgot this is the fanboy forum.  You can go more mAh for less $, with better design from other brands.	squeevey	t3_6cgmde
t3_6cgmde	t1_dhuhk7y	1495376723	Isn't that the same as always charging the phone? Or are you saying it fools the system to think it is using the battery? I'd be really surprised to think the system could switch power sources like that. When you drain your battery and plug it in, it still takes time for the battery to get some charge before the system will boot.  This tells me that power goes through your battery regardless.    Regarding the heat, it gets warm just like normal but it doesn't get "hot".   Lastly, mophie has earned me as a customer because their warranty is crazy good. They've sent me new cases even when it was my fault the case broke.	squeevey	t1_dhuh71d
t3_6cgmde	t1_dhuhp9n	1495376936	one main reason i prefer the smart case is that it uses lightning to charge, so i dont need a micro usb and a lightning cable, and i get a widget to tell me how much charge it has left	georgeward800	t1_dhuhk7y
t3_6cggds	t1_dhulvhg	1495382651	You're welcome. Wish I had the tools and skill to pull that off. 👍	Trooper27	t1_dhulsuf
t3_6cgmde	t1_dhum6fn	1495383070	Dude. Are you listening to yourself? I just looked at the videos of it in use. It still charges your phone. It shows the charging indicator at the top.  In addition, it has less mAh than the Mophie Juice Pack Air, it is more expensive, and looks worse.   Yes I can argue the warranty because I've used warranties by both parties multiple times.  Here's the kicker, I was even OUT of warranty and offered to pay for a piece for my mophie case and they've just sent me a new one.  So yes. In multiple instances mophie has outperformed apple in every sense.   If you want argue that you don't want to carry a microusb cable that's cool. I accept that. I have more devices that use microusb so I'm already carrying the cable. It means i have 1 less cable cause I don't need a lightning cable.   But woe is me for forgetting that apple can do no wrong.	squeevey	t1_dhukk9i
t3_6cgmde	t1_dhumiyc	1495383551	it can either charge your phone up to 100 or if its already at 100 it will bypass the battery and use the cases battery instead mate until the case is at 0	georgeward800	t1_dhum6fn
t3_6cgmde	t1_dhumuwb	1495384003	Right just like it's plugged into the wall which also shows the charging indicator. So it does not "bypass" the battery to which was implied.	squeevey	t1_dhumiyc
t3_6bl60h	t1_dhumz66	1495384168	Yep. No wrap around. They do this with the "natural wraps" also. I like it because I have a little protection for setting the phone down, but I have the gripiness of the jet black.	talones	t1_dhud8ka
t3_6cgmde	t1_dhun3yi	1495384354	im pretty sure if you keep it plugged into the wall and use it it just trickle charges it every so often ? whereas this genuinely bypasses the battery and uses the case instead	georgeward800	t1_dhumuwb
t3_6cgmde	t1_dhun7xl	1495384508	Did i say I was smarter? Not at all. But I'm also not going to just swallow everything that is told to me.  So case in point is that the implication that it bypasses the battery is in fact false because you can still see the lightning glyph next to the battery indicator. So unless your battery is at 100% it is on fact charging the battery. Otherwise it uses the battery case as if the phone were plugged into the wall. There is nothing different about that from any other charging case. So don't pretend that apple has solved any giant mystery of phone charging.  It functions the same.     That's awesome that you get a widget. I'm not denying that. But quit sucking at the tit of something just because it has a brand logo on it.	squeevey	t1_dhumm8j

t3_6cithd	t1_dhv5o7l	1495409783	No you definitely want the S model. The extra GB of RAM is crucial and makes a noticeable different along with extending it's useful life significantly. Plus the A9 processor is obviously faster and it has the usual incremental upgrades, camera etc. It's also made from a stronger aluminum alloy that solves that rare (but serious) potential bending problem in the 6+.

t3_6cithd	t1_dhv9sjy	1495415826	I'll be surprised if iOS 12 supports 1GB devices. iOS 11 will probably cut off support for 32bit (5, 5c)devices.

t3_6cithd	t1_dhv9w1c	1495415965	While I agree, I still wouldn't be that surprised considering the 4s on iOS 9 wasn't good either yet they continued it from iOS 8 which was still bad.   I'm just judging it based off past patterns.   Edit: either way if we find out in a few weeks that the 5s supports iOS 11, I'd be surprised if the 6 didn't with iOS 12 as usually it would get one more year of support than the predecessor.

t3_6chiyg	t1_dhv9ws6	1495415996	I  think it's possible, but the Note 8 is reportedly trying to do this as well (S8 was released too early for Samsung), but both Samsung and Apple are having trouble making it work reliably.  Whoever does it first will have a great advantage.	Rcmacc	t1_dhv37dg
t3_6cithd	t1_dhva0lq	1495416151	I see your point. iOS 12 with 1GB would be horrible, though. We shall see what Apple does on June 5th. 10.3.3 will probably be the last update for the 5/5c.	goldenticket2016	t1_dhv9w1c
t3_6cithd	t1_dhva3s0	1495416280	Agreed. I'm with you in saying it *shouldn't* get iOS 12. Now whether I think it won't, that's another story lol.   Cheers!	Scithmal	t1_dhva0lq

t3_6cithd	t1_dhvazbi	1495417520	A8 (iPhone 6/6 Plus) is hardly even faster than A7 (iPhone 5s) though. 20% across the board. That's hardly anything. A8 -&gt; A9 was 70% faster CPU and 90% GPU.

t3_6cmbe7	t1_dhvpv4i	1495448464	Cortex Camera app. Been around since 2012. Similar to Clear Camera app in the past.   I think Apple should apply on the fly image stacking algorithm like this to their photos. I am sure Google Pixel does it.	enzyme69	t1_dhvpral
t3_6cmbe7	t1_dhvpwy7	1495448622	Pretty sure they already do, but probably not as aggressive or advanced as Pixel. Cortex camera requires you to hold the phone still for a period of time. There's no way the built-in camera takes this approach.	illusionmist	t1_dhvpv4i
t3_6cmbe7	t1_dhvpyx9	1495448786	However the result is still impressively clean. Maybe slightly smooth result, but with double Megapixel.  Much better than the normal telephoto with its shocking quality noise in low light.  RAW of iPhone Camera needs some loving from Apple.	enzyme69	t1_dhvpwy7

t3_6cmgv2	t1_dhvrabj	1495452392	Dude, what are your other options? The iPhone 5s is 3 generations/3 and a half years old, so I wouldn't get it.

t3_6cmgv2	t1_dhvrf7k	1495452719	I looked for the SE initially, but I would have to pay €150 out of my own pocket :( Considering that the phone won't be actually mine, I'd rather go for Android then. I'm also thinking Galaxy A3 2016 or P9 Lite.	VladTepesDraculea	t1_dhvr3pd
t3_6cmgv2	t1_dhvrk1t	1495453035	&gt; Dude, what are your other options?  Mostly Huawei P9 Lite (have to pay €16  out of my pocket), Samsung Galaxy A3 (2016), Huawei P8 Lite or Microsoft Lumia 650.

t3_6cmgv2	t1_dhvs579	1495454340	*Avoid budget Samsung phones at all costs.*  Unlike the newer Samsung flagships, the budget and mid tier phones tend to have horrendously buggy and slow firmware. They tout impressive looking specs for their price but the actual experience of using the device isn't representative of the hardware at all.  I'd say the P9 Lite would be a better option. Or to be honest just a Moto E or Moto G - they may be cheap phones but they're fantastically well optimised and just work really well.	DatDeLorean	t1_dhvrf7k
t3_6cmgv2	t1_dhvtfz4	1495456906	Its a good phone but its quite old now. Don't know how long it would actually last you. I would just go for an android or save up for a better model.	Chris538	t3_6cmgv2

t3_6cmgv2	t1_dhvtlas	1495457173	oof, that's a doozy, um, not gonna lie, none of the other options are appealing either haha! Uh, definitely avoid the Lumia 650, that with its Snapdragon 212 and 1 GB of RAM, never mind Windows 10 and its sparse app range. The A3 (2016) and the P8 Lite are not much more appealing either, while the P9 Lite is fine as a mid-ranger.  Since you said you already have your own personal phone, does your company allow you to sell the company phone they give you? If so, you could always go with that route, where you choose the iPhone 5s, and then sell it and buy a better Android device. Heck, you can sell your personal phone too, and pool up the cash from both sales and buy yourself a pretty decent device!  If you're SOL and not allowed, well, I'd say go for the P9 Lite, but I am a bit wary of EMUI, it's not the greatest. Also, battery life on the P9 Lite isn't that good either, not according to AnandTech's accurate and honestly really well-made custom battery benchmarks, with the 5s being not that much better either.

t3_6cmgv2	t1_dhvv948	1495459944	&gt; does your company allow you to sell the company phone they give you?  Nop. I can buy it from the company after 2 years if the company deems it outdated (it usually does) and for a price to be evaluated (usually, as far as I been told, does not exceed €50)  &gt; Heck, you can sell your personal phone too, and pool up the cash from both sales and buy yourself a pretty decent device!  I have a Nexus 6, I'm pretty happy with it (aside battery life), but I have to have two phones (or dual SIM), as I have my personal SIM and the company SIM to carry.	VladTepesDraculea	t1_dhvtlas
t3_6cmgv2	t1_dhvw3dx	1495461173	ah damn, that sucks. On the bright side, you have a Nexus 6, so I'd say yeah, get the iPhone 5s in that case, just so you get a good taste of both worlds. You could also try risking it with the P9 Lite, but that EMUI skin, eh, especially in comparison to a Nexus, I dunno, don't exactly have faith in it.  Also, have you thought of rooting your Nexus 6, if you haven't already? Being a Nexus device, as well as having the Snapdragon 805, it's bound to have a lot of custom ROMs on XDA, and seeing it's past its warranty, no loss with rooting either.  Also, while the Nexus 6 had its fair share of issues when it was released with Android Lollipop, didn't Marshmallow resolve the battery drain issues? Then again, it's almost a 3yo device now (wow time flies!), so if you had it from the early days, the battery would be pretty old by now. You could always try replacing the battery with a new one, iFixit rated it 7/10 for repairability.	GastroAffectedCastro	t1_dhvv948

t3_6co95b	t1_dhw70ea	1495474375	The keyboard thing on android can definitely be annoying. I switch between my S7 and iPhone 7 all the time and that's one of the biggest things for me. I never feel like I can just pop off a text to someone real fast on the s7 because the phone takes longer to unlock, longer to get to the messaging app and longer to load the keyboard. And yes it most likely is because I have a lot of widgets and apps...but isn't that the point of android. Why even offer customizable everything when all it does is kill battery and make the phone slower, which is why I always laugh whenever people say "delete blank" and you'll get way better battery life...why would I want to isn't the whole point of android to have those options but to make the phone work well you can use any...

t3_6co95b	t1_dhwfrm7	1495484385	The 6p had a cheap battery in it, it's why I don't buy the cheap Chinese phones anymore, the battery in them degrade way too fast. And it may seem like you get more screen on time but the iPhone actually doesn't do too well in screen on time, standby time is excellent but actual usage it falls pretty far behind phones like the Galaxy S8 or Pixel or the latest HTC phones.

t3_6co95b	t1_dhwg451	1495484790	&gt;fast and accurate fingerprint scanner. On galaxy s7 I sometimes had to retry, because my finger was not recognized. And I had all 4 possible fingerprints added of the same finger, to make it fail less... On iPhone it just works, and on my model fingerprint scanner (Touch ID) is first gen, I wonder how 2nd gen on iphone 7 works  Second-generation Touch ID is a LOT faster to the point where it could get annoying if you really like using the lock screen for notifications. But the Raise to Wake feature kinda makes up for that so that you don't have to press anything when you pick up the phone.  &gt;location services configuration: you can control app permissions to location in the following ways: off, when app is used, always. Android lacks the middle one, and it really is a cool feature. I hope google will add it too.  This is dependent on the iOS app supporting it. Too many still lack the "While Using the App" option, unfortunately.  &gt;Calendar background sync. Takes so long to sync, that you may miss event, if you add it on your PC for later today. Calendar sync takes like 10 hours, although, I use push where available, and have fetch set to 1 hour. Is it a bug?  Yeah, that's strange. What service do you sync your calendar with?  &gt;google Inbox reminders do not sync at all in background (luckily emails do). Sync is only when I open the app (same as in calendar). I suspect its app fault, because Facebook messenger works perfect with sync. Notification is instant when message arrives. Even if I close the app, or reboot phone.  Sounds like a bug with the app or something Google hasn't bothered to implement yet.  &gt;no "real" widgets. You don't have weather indicators near your frequent icons, and for upcoming calendar events you have to swipe to the left, to see widget page  Eh, I mean there are "real" widgets. They're just not as convenient for some people as they are on Android. You might want to try to be more reliant on notifications instead for calendars, weather, that sort of thing.  &gt;no file system. You cannot download zip in chrome, find it in file manager, unzip and open file you wanted  There's no visible file system (which I still think is for the best), but there are ways around it. There are apps like Documents by Readdle that can open ZIP files and do that sort of thing, and this stuff can be easy to do. In Chrome, when you download a ZIP file, you can hit the "Open In" button on the bottom right to bring up the share sheet. You can then easily import that file into another app (assuming it's supported).  &gt;picture in picture comes in android O? It was already for a long time in facebook messanger in android. I miss those chat bubbles. But multitasking on apple device is fast, and you can be 100% sure, that when you will go back to app you will continue when you last were. New iPhones have 2 gb ram, and in terms of multitasking it feels much more than 4 gb in samsung.  It's something that's in iOS for iPad, but not for iPhone. I'm guessing Apple thinks that an iPhone screen is too small for PiP.	icystorm	t3_6co95b

t3_6cq48n	t1_dhwkb2t	1495489819	What else has been a red flag for you? If your gut is telling you something is fishy I would return it asap and get your money back. If you're low on funds try checking out refurbished iPhones directly from Apple. Comes with a one year warranty and new casing, screen and battery. Only refurbished part is the chipset.	Iammattieee	t1_dhwk8ew
t3_6cq48n	t1_dhwkiov	1495490080	Yeah, I'm willing to bet that's the case then. I've definitely seen pictures of legit ones that have that regulation stuff on the back. I think ours here used to have it too, so that isn't a red flag to me.	enragedbreakfast	t1_dhwkgnr
t3_6cq48n	t1_dhwkj5o	1495490096	No immediate red flags for me because I haven't had an iPhone in a few years so don't know much about them, but because its from ebay i have become paranoid about it being fake or a scam of some kind.	Yesmandog	t1_dhwkb2t
t3_6cq48n	t1_dhwkk4e	1495490129	Also i haven't received it yet as I only purchased it earlier today.	Yesmandog	t1_dhwkj5o
t3_6cqab1	t1_dhwll89	1495491450	The title is very click baity.    The bill would require major companies to fund the mom and pop repair shops doing third-party repairs.     For example, you own a reputable business that makes blenders.  You recommend that your customers return their faulty blender to you in order to make the necessary repairs and not void the warranty.  With the passing of this bill, a new repair business sets up shop in BFE and starts offering repairs of your company's blender for a nominal fee.  Not only are they making money off of your company, you have to provide them with the tools.      Apple, Verizon, and the like do make money hand over fist, but this bill is insane.	yomandenver	t3_6cqab1

t3_6co95b	t1_dhwn3jl	1495493390	Absolutley agree with you for smartphones, but Android is still a great customizable OS for other devices. I've bought the GPD XD, an Android handheld with physical buttons for playing emulators and in that case, no iPhone can't compete. Yes, i needed to flash another rom to override some of the Android security (no full power on Android for more then 5 minutes? Come on Google...), but that's the case, the community for customizing Android is great, the community for emulators is great and many games from the Play Store are better with physical buttons.  I would probably never buy a Android smartphone anymore, but i some cases Android is still the better OS.   My smartphone between my last Android and my iPhone 6S today, was an Lumia 640 with Windows. That smartphone is the main reason, i would never, ever buy a product from Microsoft again. If I need a new Notebook, i'll buy a one with FreeDOS to install Ubuntu without any support from Apple, but Microsoft will never get a single step into my house.	Pestilence360	t3_6co95b

t3_6cqab1	t1_dhwo55a	1495494773	That doesn't make sense... The 3rd party shops would have to buy the tools from Apple, the bill doesn't force companies to give out tools like you're making it sound.  I don't see how this is bad for consumers at all. It drives the price down for repairs and if you still want to go to an Apple store, you're free to do that. More options is not bad.

t3_6co95b	t1_dhwphvm	1495496516	I've gone to an Android "flagship" phone every year just to see if it gets better (past few have been LG G3, HTC One, and Galaxy S8). I usually end up liking it for a month and then missing the iPhone just for the speediness of everything. I love the customization aspect, but what's the point if every time I open Snapchat or a text notification it lags? I'm trading in my S8 for an iPhone 7 again until the 8 comes out for that reason (thanks for Jump on Demand, T-Mobile!)	CptnAwesom3	t3_6co95b
t3_6cqab1	t1_dhwpqsj	1495496836	&gt; The New York bill, which was introduced in January, would require electronic manufacturers to provide diagnostic and repair information — such as tools, replacement parts, and repair guides — to outside companies or individuals who want to carry out their own device repairs.  You were saying?      Yes, it drives the price of repairs down, but it's only going to allow companies like Apple to find ways to recoup those expenses elsewhere.	yomandenver	t1_dhwo55a
t3_6cqab1	t1_dhwqbg1	1495497576	That quote still doesn't say they are going to give the tools out for free... Just that Apple has to provide them with the tools and info, which makes sense since it's all the tools are proprietary to Apple.	FreakTalent	t1_dhwpqsj

t3_6cqab1	t1_dhwqsrh	1495498200	&gt; The bill would require major companies to fund the mom and pop repair shops doing third-party repairs.   keyword being **fund**, not supply or provide.

t3_6cqab1	t1_dhwr50q	1495498630	Nope, it has two definitions and you don't fit either. Congrats.  &gt;fund   fənd/Submit   noun   1.   a sum of money saved or made available for a particular purpose.

You just upload all your music, ceate a playlist of the music you want to sync, and press the download button on your phone.

t3_6co95b	t1_dhx26ln	1495513169	Have you tried removing and readding the Google Calendar account?  And no, the While Using the App is not available for every app. I wish Apple would require all apps to provide that as a choice, but some, like the Dominos Pizza app or Glympse, only provide Never and Always.

When is a good time to stop technology progression? Who decides that? You think if people working at Apple or Samsung just stopped making phones they would all instantly solve the world's hungry or energy crisis? You think that would instantly fix income inequality? You sound so naive and worse, im sure you are using a computer or phone or tablet that has been made within the past 2 years to reply to these messages so you are part of the problem.	thebuggalo	t1_dhxgarq
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxgxdw	1495546425	they removed the headphone jack to increase water resistance and make room for the taptic engine, not to make the phone thinner. the 7/7 Plus is no thinner than the 6S/6S Plus.	swissarmybriefs	t1_dhxf5nj

t3_6csqil	t1_dhxh8tp	1495546858	The SE is a 4 Inch screen and smaller phone. It has all the internals and camera from the 6S so it's still a really good phone and buttery smooth. The 6S (Plus) is last years model. It wont have the upgraded RAM, camera, water resistance, or internals of the 7 Plus, but is still a pretty fast and worthwhile device. Then you get to the 7 Plus which is Apples newest flagship. Water resistance, New processors, new solid state home button, more RAM and dual cameras. Check out Apple's website and you should be able to compare all of them side by side.	ltrout99	t1_dhxe7cc
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxh9y0	1495546901	It's not the fault of Android or Google, it's Samsung's greed by installing so much bloatware. If they would release a phone with stock Android similar to the Pixel line it would be very powerful and fast.	ggKevin	t1_dhxbvv9
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxhep7	1495547077	CPU no, GPU yes. Which in this case is integrated with the CPU causing it to heat up quicker and leads to throttling much sooner.	ggKevin	t1_dhxael0

t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxho3r	1495547429	Lmao, yes I think we all know what the high pixel density screen can provide. But that's the GPU handling that problem.  Let me make it simpler for you:  Imagine if the Galaxy S8 was with the same resolution as the iPhone 6s, that way the GPU will be working for the same amount of pixels making the UI smoother but that is all the GPU can do. It cannot make the process faster and help other key components like the storage and cpu. It will still give you the same exact results you just saw on the video. But with smoother UI.  The reason the S8 runs 1080p out of the box is to ensure that smoothness in the UI, + save battery on the GPU because that is the biggest battery draining component in the phone. Just like on Laptops and PC's the GPU has the highest power draw of all the components.	Eddytion	t1_dhxbf55

t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxj2fs	1495549212	Samsung produces their own SoC called the Exynos, it is replaced by the snapdragon in North America because of qualcomm patent fuckery.

t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxk1tj	1495550404	It's just a more subtle and accurate vibration motor. Most phones move around a bit while vibrating and you can feel the whole phone shake. The taptic engine, however, is more isolated and feels like someone is tapping you on the wrist to get your attention. It's also pretty cool in games.	ggKevin	t1_dhxjd1c

t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxmzx1	1495553784	Oh look. If you choose different set of apps, the result is different and s8 beats iPhone 7. http://www.tomsguide.com/us/speed-test-galaxy-s8-vs-iphone-7,review-4380.html  Also, I had the galaxy s6, then iPhone 6s, and now galaxy s7. All great pbones, but the s7 is the fastest. The reason is that I do not use cross platform apps. Almost all app developers that do cross platform do iOS first. Examples are official Reddit app, Snapchat, any smaller apps like bank apps or car sharing apps. There are exceptions (Instagram), but not as many.  However, apps done by developers who actually understand the platform they are working on are competitively fast, and usually faster than cross platform equivalents.	matus201	t3_6cs9ov
t3_6cvd3i	t1_dhxn4sb	1495553937	This app was originally written for myself as I spend quite a bit of time  commuting in the subway and did not have access to the internet.  I am actively working on the app and would appreciate any feedback or suggestions!  Thanks!   edit: I have enabled the app world wide now.  It will take some time for the servers to propagate but should be there within 24 hours. Enjoy!  edit 2:  I have submitted the app for approval in all the different app stores.  Should be hearing back from Apple within the next few days.  Will keep you guys posted.	alfcho	t3_6cvd3i
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhxo9gd	1495555199	No, the message should stay there unless you clear it manually or read it in the messages app. Otherwise, it may be some sort of bug.	cocoman2121	t1_dhxmb1n

t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxoilr	1495555484	Why is no one mentioning screen resolution?  S8 has to push probably 4x the pixels the iPhone has to push...  Try doing a speed test when the iPhone will have a closer resolution to the s8	superpopsss	t3_6cs9ov

t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxor1t	1495555751	Okay? Snapchat and other cross platform apps are hugely popular. Just because you don't use them doesn't mean a large majority of people don't. General usage lag is extremely evident on all flagship Android phones compared to iPhones. I just used an S8 for a month and am going back to an iPhone largely because of this.	CptnAwesom3	t1_dhxmzx1
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxp953	1495556320	I use Snapchat, Instagram, telegram, signal, WhatsApp. Only thing that is common and I don't use is facebook and fb messenger..  Anyways, from the apps above, only snapchat was clearly faster on iPhone 6s. Every other app is actually faster on my S7.  My bank app is ok on my phone, was better on iOS. Although it hooks into NFC and enables contactless payments without 3rd party (like apple pay or android pay) collecting your data. Car sharing app Car2Go is ok on android, better on iOS. Evo car sharing is a disaster on android, ok-ish on iOS. It's the small apps that often go iOS first...	matus201	t1_dhxor1t
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxpfne	1495556525	I've found the opposite almost across the board. Went from a 5s --&gt; LG G3 --&gt; 6 --&gt; 6s --&gt; HTC One --&gt; 6s --&gt; 7 --&gt; Galaxy S8 and now back to 7. Went back after 3-4 months (well, 1 this time around). I love the customization aspects but at the end of the day if opening even Textra has a jarring lag effect it's annoying.	CptnAwesom3	t1_dhxp953

t3_6cvd3i	t1_dhxx1hy	1495564909	Usually when dev teams release software to production on a large scale, they deploy the code by regions.  This allows them to catch errors and fix them before they deploy to the rest of the regions.    You really only have one chance to make an impression on the end user and you want it to be good.  If you release software with a bug that every user will notice when they first launch the app, the chances that they will delete the app and never use it again is quite high.  However, if you stagger your releases by regions, maybe the first region you release to will encounter the bug, which allows the developer to fix it before they release to the rest of the region.  Another reason why a developer might limit the countries that the app is released in is that they do not have localizations (i.e. translations, designs for reading from right to left, etc...) for those countries.    Those are a few of the reasons that I can think of but I am sure there are a lot more reasons for limiting the countries for an app.	alfcho	t1_dhxvyld

t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxxpzw	1495565665	I used a 6 since it came out and it never felt slow to me, probably because that was all I knew. I bought a 7 and damn is it a lot faster. iOS makes the phone seem fast even though the apps take ages to load on my iPhone 6. Try Facebook on both - on my 7 it's almost instantaneous, but on my 6 it takes 15-20 seconds.	Krishrox2000	t1_dhxr7g5
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxxw4c	1495565852	What this means is that the phone feels alive. When you throw down the notification shade, you can *feel* it bounce. When you scroll the wheel in the calendar or clock, you can *feel* it move. It's incredible.	Krishrox2000	t1_dhxkivz
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxy40m	1495566094	I don't really play games. Basic uses like social media and opening ANY app is a big difference. When simply tapping  any app, there is a sizable delay between the app icon "highlighting" and the app open animation playing out. Afterword, loading screens of 10-20+ seconds are common, where my iPhone 7 is almost instantaneous or less than 10 seconds.  Actual usability isn't too different though. It's just load times that suuuuck in comparison. Especially quick reply.	uncertain-ithink	t1_dhxr7g5
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhxyack	1495566291	Most of the time it's the animation, but at times the entire thing will lag after I click and take a second to catch up	CptnAwesom3	t1_dhxu0wz

This is an iPhone sub, and it is generally positive about the iPhone. However, what people are critiquing here is not the iPhone, but the website. Personally I think the site is cringeworthy and childish at best, and that doesn't tell you anything about what I think of the iPhone itself, and in fact I dislike that precisely because I'm very fond of the iPhone, and I don't think it does it justice at all. This seems to be the general sentiment in this thread.  If you disagree with the opinions of people in here, that's fine, but don't insult them and call them trolls, and then complain when they downvote you.  I've spend the amount of shits I give now though, so even if you can't keep yourself from replying more, I will.	zeldn	t1_dhxzjg2

t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhy0m8y	1495568856	Oops, I did. My bad, thanks for pointing that out.	barjam	t1_dhxsw4z
t3_6cvd3i	t1_dhy0v1z	1495569127	App looks nifty, hope it will be made available in India soon.	rahulistic	t1_dhxn4sb
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhy1mzd	1495569993	S8 is set to only 1080p out of the box.	Ryr45	t1_dhxoilr
t3_6cvd3i	t1_dhy1wcx	1495570284	I am going to release a version that is targeted for iOS 10.0+.  Please bear with me because Apple needs to approve the new build to go into the app store.  I apologize for this short sightedness.	alfcho	t1_dhy1kbl
t3_6cvd3i	t1_dhy2hlb	1495570937	Hi - I'm probably being annoying, but could you share which stores it will be made available in? I'm in Sweden and it's not showing here.   Thanks	jayckb	t1_dhxvo5n
t3_6cvd3i	t1_dhy2p0h	1495571170	No you are not - I have enabled it in Sweden.  Will take a few hours for the servers to propagate.  I will keep checking and let you know when it is up!  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Good point on the location list.  I will update my comment with a list of locations that the app is available in.  Thank you.	alfcho	t1_dhy2hlb
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhy2q98	1495571210	Looks pretty shit on my s7 edge too.  Needs 4k.	x3n0n1c	t1_dhxgoaz
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhy2yo1	1495571471	My S7 felt smooth to me, until I got the 7 plus, and it is an exynos model.  Now when I go back it feels like a jerky mess.  Still love the s7, but it far from being as smooth as ios.  Tried my colleagues S8+, same thing. It's just Samsung software at this point because I've also tried the Pixel XL and it was much better.	x3n0n1c	t1_dhy01ac
t3_6co95b	t1_dhy3sio	1495572404	I just added a meeting in google calendar's website on my work PC.  I immediately picked up my phone, went to calendar, and hit the today view.  The phone took about 5 seconds to sysc and my test meeting showed up. So that works.  Can't really test to see how long it takes to sync in the background.  I suppose just make a habit of opening up calendar to force a sync after doing some management from the web app.	x3n0n1c	t1_dhx206o
t3_6cpjgf	t1_dhy46h6	1495572838	"Personally I think the site is cringeworthy and childish at best"  Yeah, I am sure you know better than Apple's marketing team.	rauls4	t1_dhy0f31
t3_6cxjhy	t3_6cxjhy	1495573432	How do you guys really feel about 3D Touch?	CaveDweller521	-1
t3_6cv47t	t1_dhy4ymt	1495573725	Finally apple did something about all the complaints about huge notifications on smaller sized phones. Thank god!!!	trayche	t3_6cv47t
t3_6cxjhy	t1_dhy56zn	1495573998	Some things, like 3D touching the keyboard, are really useful and some aren't. I mostly use it in Apple Music just because I have to at times.	TheWasabiSlayer	t3_6cxjhy
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhy5nz2	1495574545	Thanks for showing us this! I hate the repeat notification making me think I got a new text.	gnarlnick	t1_dhxiy0d
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhy5u3c	1495574744	That is something I don't think is possible till now (or not something I know at least) but will be a great idea, oh btw I'm laughing so hard on that "10 times for mom"	Anton31Kah	t1_dhxzwlq
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhy5vlk	1495574791	Actually that's what I first checked but couldn't find, unfortunately it doesn't exist for missed calls although that will be a great idea	Anton31Kah	t1_dhxolxi
t3_6cv47t	t1_dhy6ac0	1495575279	Weird. Sometimes it does that to me but I chalk it up to having low memory	Garythegoon09	t1_dhy6746
t3_6cvd3i	t1_dhy6gsr	1495575492	Thanks so much! :) can't wait to try it out	jayckb	t1_dhy2p0h
t3_6cxjhy	t1_dhy6j2a	1495575565	I use it a lot, daily ! for quick replies in the lockscreen, peek at content on Twitter/Instagram ... keyboard cursor, iMessage and shortcuts in app icons. I also use it to show actions on the apple watch. At first i thought it was a gimmick but i really got used to it	RamiDebab	t3_6cxjhy
t3_6cpjgf	t1_dhy6ml3	1495575686	Worked fine for me and my Nexus 6P within the chrome app.	Mashable_Pixels	t1_dhww1n8
t3_6cpjgf	t1_dhy79kr	1495576452	Swype writing + swype gestures for fast letter/word deleting or positioning.	rauldzmartin	t1_dhxuih0
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhy7hb9	1495576711	I'm a iPhone fan too but you are absolutely right. They always neglect this detail in these speed test.	nightrhyme	t1_dhxoilr
t3_6cpjgf	t1_dhy7ix4	1495576770	Not what I'm talking about. I'm referring to Swype's quick gestures for making question marks etc.	BlackBloke	t1_dhxv10j
t3_6cpjgf	t1_dhy7nrm	1495576936	Ok, that's not what I'm referring to. I'm talking about the ability to swipe from m iirc to get question mark and more. It's incredibly annoying to have to go to another screen to get that stuff.	BlackBloke	t1_dhy79kr
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhy7q12	1495577015	Yes it does. It is clearly the graphic intensive apps (games) where iPhone catches up	nightrhyme	t1_dhxael0
t3_6cxjhy	t1_dhy82t5	1495577463	Love it. I use it in conjunction with assistive touch. No need to use the home button. On a 7plus.	perry1023	t3_6cxjhy
t3_6cxjhy	t1_dhy87th	1495577639	I think it's an interesting enough feature to require an entire redesign of the Os. As it is I mainly use it for... instantly opening a new tab in chrome.	monabluespeaks	t3_6cxjhy
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhy8w9u	1495578508	Is there seriously people that didn't know this??	Adawgg_661	t3_6cuwme
t3_6cxjhy	t1_dhy8wtw	1495578528	It's pretty great. I use it all the time on the keyboard, for replies on the lock screen and for peeking at links and photos. I occasionally use it on the icons, and I just started using it to access the app switcher. I feel like it's sometimes more convenient than reaching my thumb down to double click the home button.	Cuberonix	t3_6cxjhy
t3_6cpjgf	t1_dhy96rb	1495578883	you can get the question mark swiping from the dot	rauldzmartin	t1_dhy7nrm
t3_6cpjgf	t1_dhy9ig1	1495579305	Actually. It ain't half bad.  I love my iphone. Limiting but I like it.  I do have a galaxy note 5 I also carry around and hotspot off of the iPhone with. So I still have my android companion.	OptionalCookie	t1_dhxzncv
t3_6cpjgf	t1_dhy9sy7	1495579682	Not quite the same. Though it does help. I got accustomed to swipe typing with those easy gestures and there's just been no perfect replacement.	BlackBloke	t1_dhy96rb
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhyak8e	1495580675	I honestly don't know why you've been downvoted. It's true. Even mkbhd and most reviewers say so.	MetalGearFlaccid	t1_dhxjvkt
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhyb8bo	1495581557	i just wish when you get a text that says "bye" or "talk later" that it would only chime you once regardless of the setting.	1saac	t3_6cuwme
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhyc1ra	1495582628	A nearly two year old iPhone?  In mobile tech, two years is a long time.  Or shit just isn't getting better by the incredible leaps and bounds it once was.  Still... nearly a two year age difference.	Nerfo2	t1_dhxmxn3
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhycbk7	1495582993	Yeah, those loading progress bars are hell on GPUs.	Nerfo2	t1_dhy7q12
t3_6cxjhy	t1_dhydfoe	1495584459	I use it for cursor placement all the time (3D Touch anywhere on the stock keyboard to move the text cursor). Also, quick peeping at things in Instagram and Mail app. There are home screen shortcuts for many apps, too, but I don't seem to use those that much.  Also, I sometimes 3D Touch on the left edge of the screen to bring up the app switcher.	adamsak	t3_6cxjhy
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhyg7kg	1495587834	Are* there seriously people who* didn't know this.   Did you seriously not know how to write that??	emgirgis95	t1_dhy8w9u
t3_6cvd3i	t1_dhyh9kj	1495589051	Working to get it in all the different app stores.  Waiting for Apple's approval right now.  Sorry for the inconvenience.	alfcho	t1_dhya6wg
t3_6cv47t	t1_dhyif1a	1495590385	this is so cute,i laughed! i have no clue why though	LibbyXCX	t3_6cv47t
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhyj1vj	1495591150	This happens to me on occasion. Figured I was looking at it wrong.	MarvelsBlackCat	t1_dhxmb1n
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhyjqfb	1495591952	Good stuff, I hated that extra random vibrate. Don't need reminders at all when I can just look at the lock screen and see my notifications. Don't bother clearing them unless I actually look at them or quick reply.	GonSanzo	t3_6cuwme
t3_6cv47t	t1_dhyjt7g	1495592043	I haven't experienced this issue on my SE yet. I have the latest updates as well.	GonSanzo	t3_6cv47t
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhylx0r	1495594585	iOS 11 wishes my friend....in iOS 11 one day maybe.	Scithmal	t1_dhxzwlq
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhyn17q	1495596121	I forgot this was even a "feature". I've had repeat alerts turned off since my 4S or earlier!	kgreentree	t3_6cuwme
t3_6cxjhy	t1_dhyn1h1	1495596132	I like it but don't find it to be 100% reliable.	saarlac	t3_6cxjhy
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhyn1xw	1495596152	&gt; That is something I don't think is possible till now  Well now that it's possible tell us how! Don't keep it a secret!	MatmosOfSogo	t1_dhy5u3c
t3_6cv47t	t1_dhynkug	1495596941	Omg he's so little. Look how cute he is!!	fueledbychelsea	t3_6cv47t
t3_6cpjgf	t1_dhyp7gs	1495599602	Now you're just being contrarian for the same of it. They failed on ME, and anybody else who agree with me, which judging from the controversy in this thread is not an insignificant fraction. I cannot say if this website will work on the general population, it might. I can only say what I personally think about it, and *I PERSONALLY THINK* it's childish and cringeworthy, and I would never send it to anybody else whose opinion I trust, because I can only predict a similar reaction.  Tell me how my brain is "perceiving it wrong" or what else you think is happening here.   Also fuck, I failed, I ended up replying anyway. My will is weak.	zeldn	t1_dhy46h6
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhypkvm	1495600247	I had it turned off on my 7 plus for some reason...holy shit!! I never knew what I was missing	Billymayshere23	t1_dhxxw4c
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhypme8	1495600324	With the 6s plus you'll be fine for at least another 2 years easily	Billymayshere23	t1_dhxfbmq
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhypsxk	1495600640	I couldn't find this option when I first got my iPhone 7 Plus, then weeks later finally found it nearly instantly and felt stupid. I hate the repeat notification.	BrandonGoBlue	t3_6cuwme
t3_6curan	t1_dhyr3l9	1495603031	Well the first versions of iOS 10 were really buggy for my 6 plus, but the recent 10.3.2 update has made it pretty smooth with the APFS	liuk2	t3_6curan
t3_6cv47t	t1_dhyr607	1495603161	You telling me you can't read that?!?	Tunavi	t3_6cv47t
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhyrld2	1495604015	I'm in the exact same boat.. I used to be a diehard Android fan and decided to try the 7 Plus. The experience of feeling those little bumps and clicks can only be described as magical.. Scrolling through the time or date is my favourite feeling thing!	rqadri	t1_dhxq5gu
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhyrmjw	1495604080	Thank you omg I already searched on the message settings but not in notification... It's so annoying sometimes	Loutchiano	t3_6cuwme
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhyrucj	1495604532	Are your messages synced to a Mac and someone else (or you) viewing them there? That will remove the notification from your phone.	mavantix	t1_dhxmb1n
t3_6curan	t1_dhys84l	1495605352	Good to know. I'm still leaning towards not updating after doing a bit of searching.	Wellas	t1_dhyr3l9
t3_6curan	t1_dhysbwq	1495605577	Yeah I probably would stay where you are. The ram management is better on iOS 9	liuk2	t1_dhys84l
t3_6curan	t1_dhysjri	1495606058	You've got an SE with A9 processor it should run smooth af imo... 🤔	jeff_john	t1_dhxldeo
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhyskyv	1495606132	I'm sorry I have been misunderstood, what I meant is that there is no way that I know about, I did some searching on google and I couldn't find anything else than people saying "how to disable the annoying repeating alerts" but as soon as I find something I'll post it here and tag you in the comments	Anton31Kah	t1_dhyn1xw
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhysp0m	1495606377	It's in the bottom of the messages notifications screen and usually no one scrolls down, since only the messages app offers this feature and Apple hasn't mentioned it ever, it's was something right infront of us but we couldn't see it	Anton31Kah	t1_dhylvb8
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhysr9d	1495606514	Well many people didn't know about it and the post wasn't aimed at the people who already know it...	Anton31Kah	t1_dhy8w9u
t3_6cxjhy	t1_dhysrqz	1495606542	i use it so much, on the home screen, safari, facebook, twitter, instagram, for live photos and for the keyboard cursor. its become second nature and when im on non 3d touch phones i get confused why its not working	georgeward800	t3_6cxjhy
t3_6cxjhy	t1_dhyssmr	1495606596	you can 3d touch the assistive touch button and it takes you home, you can customise this action in settings https://www.igeeksblog.com/add-3d-touch-options-to-assistivetouch-on-iphone-6s-6s-plus/	georgeward800	t1_dhyof20
t3_6cxjhy	t1_dhyst0w	1495606621	i like how theyve made it so you have to use it more and more across the os because in ios 9 it barely had any functionality	georgeward800	t1_dhy56zn
t3_6cxjhy	t1_dhytcfs	1495607865	Due to the overwhelmingly positive response I suppose I will have to look into it and start using it. I realize now that I use it for keyboard cursor and had no idea that was a 3D Touch feature. Thanks everyone!	CaveDweller521	t3_6cxjhy
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhyw43t	1495615298	That's why the S8 does not run at full resolution.	v8xd	t1_dhxoilr
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhyx3yf	1495618117	Try gaming on a galaxy s8 after using an iPhone. Samsung galaxy s8 looks all nice and pretty with beefy specs but lags up the ass while an "underrated" iPhone breezes thru anything thrown at it.	eskay88	t3_6cs9ov
t3_6cxjhy	t1_dhyzdfq	1495623955	There are a lot of 3D Touch actions available. You just got to find what's useful for you and see if you can implement them in your day to day use. I use the 3D Touch on my keyboard a lot to move cursor or select text and also app icons to shortcuts (this depends on how well the developer implement this).	andykan	t3_6cxjhy
t3_6cvd3i	t1_dhyzgb8	1495624111	Ill be waiting for this release! How can I be informed when this version is live?	Ilkzz	t1_dhy1wcx
t3_6cv47t	t1_dhz242h	1495628437	LOL  I didn't think on this one.  I like how we have different memes to say the same thing.	iBranko	t1_dhxvw8g
t3_6cvd3i	t1_dhz3qqy	1495630619	Which location are you in?  I will do my best to notify users who have requested!	alfcho	t1_dhyzgb8
t3_6cvd3i	t1_dhz3uji	1495630747	UK. As above, I'm on 10.2 so I can't use the app just yet.	Ilkzz	t1_dhz3qqy
t3_6cvd3i	t1_dhz47cp	1495631200	Ok thanks for the info.  I have submitted the new version to target 10.0 + instead of 10.3 yesterday and I am hoping Apple will approve it today.  I will message you when it is in the app store.  Thank you.	alfcho	t1_dhz3uji
t3_6cvd3i	t1_dhz4hqc	1495631556	Hey, I am not sure which app store Sweden belongs to (Apple does not list Sweden, Finland or Norway in the app store) but I checked Denmark's app store and was able to find it there.  Could you check and let me know if you are able to find the app?  Thank you!	alfcho	t1_dhy6gsr
t3_6cs9ov	t1_dhz4ov8	1495631793	No, they removed it so wired headphones had to pay Apple royalties to use the Lightning port. The iPhone 6S had a TapTic Engine.	ClassyJacket	t1_dhxgxdw
t3_6cv47t	t1_dhza20n	1495637624	Maybe women are already used to see small thin-  Oh wait...	iBranko	t1_dhz8oiz
t3_6cxjhy	t1_dhzctla	1495640380	Yeah. Back on my 6s I never used it lol. I don't think my dad uses it at all. (He got me a 7plus so he could have the 6s)	TheWasabiSlayer	t1_dhyst0w

t3_6cpjgf	t1_dhzei2r	1495642009	To be fair, Google doesn't sell your information either - they simply sell the ability to put an ad in front of the right person.	cipher29	t1_dhwyui1
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzgei1	1495643848	Don't know about you guys, but half way through this comment I started reading War and Peace because I needed a short break.	RougeCrown	t3_6d32j0
t3_6cxjhy	t1_dhzho9v	1495645056	Even if the 3D Touch was strictly for bringing up the keyboard cursor, it is extremely useful.	eskay88	t3_6cxjhy
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzhres	1495645138	Damn...I'm rooting for you bro. Hopefully they help you.   Where did you buy the phone from, if not the Apple store?	mariecinder	t3_6d32j0
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzhxnh	1495645305	I don't want to put any names into it of retailers or reps but it is a fully authorized retailer that I used as the Apple store was sold out.	whoamanwtf	t1_dhzhres
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzi7uf	1495645595	Please tell us how it turns out. Sounds like a pretty annoying experience!	crazymacs134	t3_6d32j0
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzibop	1495645707	This story is extremely long but I do hope it get's resolved. If you're so inclined, I'd recommend sending them all of this. "Them" being a relevant party who could help. If you mentioned that you already have, I apologize because I skimmed it.	ArchiveSQ	t1_dhzhxnh
t3_6cv47t	t1_dhziful	1495645828	I did several years ago.  I think I'm missing some joke here? I'm sorry, it's was REALLY several years ago.	iBranko	t1_dhzemby
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhziku8	1495645976	Yeah I know it is long, I just wanted to include any details that seemed important in case the "right" person were to read it and possibly help find a solution.	whoamanwtf	t1_dhzibop
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzirjh	1495646167	Best Buy?   Same issue happened to me with my launch day iPhone 7. Bought it in cash, locked to T-Mobile, nothing no one could do when I tried to unlock it to sell it when my 7 Plus arrived.	djlaxl	t1_dhzhxnh
t3_6d3i8c	t1_dhzk6jp	1495647636	I love mine. It is wonderful to hold. So easy to keep on you. Performs excellently. Is beautiful. Gets great battery life.  If it is what you want, don't let the order of release determine what is "best."	JEJ514	t3_6d3i8c
t3_6d3i8c	t1_dhzkdr0	1495647842	I went from 5 &gt; 6 &gt; SE 64. My only regret is not waiting for the 128 gb, even though i don't need all that space. but I saved about 200+ by going with the 64	23--	t3_6d3i8c
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzkhg2	1495647946	Honestly at this point just pay for an unlocking service and be done with it lol	freshairr	t3_6d32j0
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzlae1	1495648784	Im pretty sure whatever sim you put into an iPhone first it locks to it immediately.  At least thats what i was told at the store. The guy told me to buy a cheap Verizon sim to activate it on that because they don't lock phones and then i can pit my own sim in	ifelldownthestair	t3_6d32j0
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhzlemv	1495648911	How do i activate this control for Watsapp? I don't think that functionality is even there.	KoyalRiverMan	t3_6cuwme

t3_6d3i8c	t1_dhzll6z	1495649105	Upgraded from a 5S and it's wonderful. Lasts a lot longer than my 5S and is much smoother.	PM_ME_DICK_PICTURES	t3_6d3i8c
t3_6cuwme	t1_dhzm8fx	1495649712	You said "till now" which means that you couldn't do it *until now*, that now there is a way to do it.	MatmosOfSogo	t1_dhyskyv
t3_6d3i8c	t1_dhzmfvd	1495649909	Love mine. Size is good for one-handed use. No camera bump and lock button in the right place. Battery life is fantastic.  However, I have found as time goes on less mobile pages are optimized for small screens, so it's even more cramped than it was 2-3 years ago with the 5/5S. So if you get an ad and a "we use cookies" popup only like 25% of the screen that is actual content.	byerss	t3_6d3i8c
t3_6d3i8c	t1_dhzmoum	1495650149	6+ to SE... Amazing phone. I really love the small form factor, fits in every pocket. From time to time I freak out a little bit since I can barely feel it in my pocket after the 6+ :-D It is a beast considering performace! I am very light user so it keeps ALL my apps in RAM, gets 2-3 days on 1 charge (with SleepCycle running every night). Most would consider that battery life amazing I consider it OK, because I had my 6+ jailbroken and it lasted 4-5  days on single charge for me. Overall it is fantastic phone!	Benediktxvi	t3_6d3i8c
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzn14p	1495650476	I see you have "att" autocorrect to "AT&amp;T".	PANSIES_FOR_ALL	t3_6d32j0
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzn9pr	1495650702	Yeah, the issue with their system is the fact it would lock to a carrier that is apparently unable up unlock the device once it has been done.	whoamanwtf	t1_dhzlae1
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhznd5s	1495650796	I don't think that's the case. I was on Cricket when I bought my 7 Plus from Apple, and switching to T-Mobile was as easy as swapping the SIMs. No lock issues whatsoever. I know I'd be pretty pissed if a carrier just decided they had a right to lock my phone that I bought in full from somewhere else to their network.	THE_SEX_YELLER	t1_dhzlae1
t3_6d3i8c	t1_dhzohwk	1495651888	Overall use of the phone is great. Feels awesome to use one handed and my hands can chill now as I came from the 6s. However, battery life is terrible for me. It must be my unit as others are doing fine. Will probably take it to the apple store and see what they say as its still under warranty.	akareeno	t3_6d3i8c
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzolpp	1495651991	From what I've read it varies, depending where you buy it from. If you get it straight from Apple then it'll never lock to anything. But if you get it from Carphone Warehouse for example, then it locks to the first network you use it with. Only found that out after a friend got one from them, I was quite surprised.	vyper248	t1_dhznd5s
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzooiz	1495652066	My experience is that if you buy an iPhone outright from anywhere other than Apple Store, it will lock to the carrier of the first sim you put into it.	Flugzeugler	t3_6d32j0
t3_6d3i8c	t1_dhzovzn	1495652264	I love mine, but I came from android devices and cannot compare it to any other Apple devices	Jackson_Cook	t3_6d3i8c
t3_6d456b	t1_dhzp61g	1495652532	What does the rest of the device look like?  Betting its had a screen replacement	sglville	t3_6d456b
t3_6d456b	t1_dhzp7e6	1495652571	The rest is fine accept a hair line crack on the top right of the screen.	Yesmandog	t1_dhzp61g
t3_6d456b	t1_dhzpohk	1495653012	I had something similar happen on my 6S, cause I dropped it on the corner with the headphone jack. It didn't crack as on the photo, but it kinda bent in a bit.	snowflakelord	t3_6d456b
t3_6d456b	t1_dhzr3m3	1495654355	I think they're suggesting that it might be a knockoff.	UrsusRagnor	t1_dhzp80c
t3_6d456b	t1_dhzrmq2	1495654861	Someone dropped it on that corner (probably while in a case so no scratch damage) but it buckled the frame because that port creates a weak spot in the frame.	l0keman	t3_6d456b
t3_6d456b	t1_dhzrtfl	1495655043	So it's just cosmetic? Im going to put a case on that should cover it anyway, just wanted to make sure it wasn't something more serious.	Yesmandog	t1_dhzrmq2
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzskef	1495655755	They sold you a phone that was locked and sold you AppleCare+ through that provider (therefore all replacements/refurbs would be locked to that carrier).	Curlywurlywoo	t1_dhzhxnh
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzsspb	1495655980	I hope that I can finish the first book in this series before the next update cones out.	SilentWolfe	t3_6d32j0
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzsvo9	1495656063	Honestly, OP should try this. Google for some websites, create a PayPal for this only, and give it a shot. Get a SIM card from the network you want to be with.	Curlywurlywoo	t1_dhzkhg2
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhztv5m	1495657107	I got mine from apple so its completely unlocked which is nice	ifelldownthestair	t1_dhzolpp
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhztyjh	1495657208	Just like another user said above it might depend on where you buy it from. Mine is from Apple so it never locked so the associate was misinformed.	ifelldownthestair	t1_dhzsi34
t3_6d3i8c	t1_dhzutfg	1495658104	Came from the Oneplus One. Think it's easily the best value for your money out there. I love the smaller size and battery life.	SV19	t3_6d3i8c
t3_6d456b	t1_dhzvwkj	1495659228	I don't understand what's with the down vote. I wouldn't buy a phone that could have been dropped either.	americanmuscle1988	t1_dhztu1s
t3_6d456b	t1_dhzwffa	1495659789	I don't understand the down vote either but you have that chance with any second hand phone and admittedly this phone has proof it had has been dropped, but I see the damage as only cosmetic.	Yesmandog	t1_dhzvwkj
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzwod5	1495660060	+1 for the effort you put into writing this long story.  Now, I see that you've tried quite a few things.  Have you tried this link?     https://www.tfwunlockpolicy.com/wps/portal/home/   If so, what message do you get after entering your serial number?	RedOSRed	t3_6d32j0
t3_6d456b	t1_dhzwple	1495660096	Looks dropped. My iPhone 6 did this. I'd be careful buying this device. If it works and the cosmetic damage doesn't bug you and at a good price I don't see why you wouldn't buy the device. Just know if it was dropped it could have more damage	TheWasabiSlayer	t3_6d456b
t3_6d456b	t1_dhzxbej	1495660753	No.. He's just making fun of the 7's lack of a headphone jack.	XeroTrinity	t1_dhzr3m3
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzxbyx	1495660769	I work for an authorized apple retailer in Canada and I know that at least in Canada the only place you can get an unlocked iPhone is through apple directly. The ones that are shipped to our store are pre-locked.	deancomeautela	t1_dhzhxnh
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzy7ro	1495661759	The really about part of that is, according to Apple the actual device is an ATT device, I'm trying to use it on ATT so if this were true I'd be content.	whoamanwtf	t1_dhzskef
t3_6d456b	t1_dhzyp19	1495662301	Would the other damage be obvious, like would the touchscreen be dodgy(just an example) or would the problems develop after some time?	Yesmandog	t1_dhzwple
t3_6d456b	t1_dhzypih	1495662315	If there's a 7 at the end of the OPs comment, I can't see it due to mobile, but maybe just a knockoff in general. Not sure!	UrsusRagnor	t1_dhzwhbu
t3_6d32j0	t1_dhzziwv	1495663266	I read this whole thing. I found it compelling as I've lived through this scenario so many times.   I work in IT for a group of radiologists. I am constantly having reach out for tech support on exotic diagnostic imaging systems. Finger-pointing, conflicting info from different support people, and dropped-balls are constant issues.   You have to document, document, document EVERYTHING. Always take names. Good luck man. Upvoting to help your social-media impact.	mrHappy-	t3_6d32j0

t3_6d456b	t1_di008a9	1495664120	I would assume it would by now. Again on my iPhone 6 I dropped it and a few days later I realized it had lines going down the display.  This is what it looked like if you were curious https://imgur.com/dYJdyRi	TheWasabiSlayer	t1_dhzyp19
t3_6d32j0	t1_di00fo3	1495664359	Yeah it definitely is, but it seems to be a persistent thought in this thread	Gorgggg	t1_dhzw502
t3_6d456b	t1_di00p0q	1495664673	Same problem on mine after I dropped it! At least I know I'm not alone 😂	lorigra	t3_6d456b
t3_6d32j0	t1_di00qae	1495664715	I actually had training on the specifics of the nature of the iPhone 7 being "unlocked" just to try and avoid situations like this. They're not truly unlocked like you think, they're unlocked in the way you can put them on any carrier(the universal one is any carrier, but the GSM one is only AT&amp;T and T-Mo) but once you put a specific carriers SIM card in it they are locked to that specific carrier. I'm fairly certain there's no way of fixing it either without swapping devices but since you didn't get it from Apple it's probably not gonna happen.	PM_Me_Your_Tabs	t3_6d32j0
t3_6d456b	t1_di00zo4	1495665033	Not at all, it was kinda bent around the headphone jack, but it worked perfectly fine.	snowflakelord	t1_dhzwmja
t3_6d32j0	t1_di010dh	1495665056	Just think of the millions of iPhones sold in countries with no Apple stores.	goroka	t1_di00fo3
t3_6d3i8c	t1_di01mep	1495665795	I just switched from Nexus devices, the SE is my first iPhone in a long while (since the original iPhone).   I'm very happy. Design definitely doesn't feel dated -- good design typically ages well.	altthought	t3_6d3i8c
t3_6d456b	t1_di028qm	1495666561	If the jack plays music, you should be fine. Even if the jack no longer works, you could haggle the price and just use BT or lightning jack headphones. It's prolly just the case, though it could have broke the solder on the jack itself if headphones were plugged in when it fell. But, if that was the case, the frame would not have buckled around the jack. A lot of people complained about the jack, but have no real idea about the mountain of negatives that the jack causes.	l0keman	t3_6d456b
t3_6d32j0	t1_di02bd9	1495666651	It doesn't work inside words, though. It might be TextExpander or something. Or, as I thought in the beginning, OP is just trying to be funny.	crazymacs134	t1_dhzn14p
t3_6d3i8c	t1_di02ea2	1495666748	I went from a 6s to an SE (mine got stolen) about a month ago and I really love it. I always kinda missed the 5s design and I'm happy with mine. Took me about a week to really get used to the smaller screen again.	youthcanoe	t3_6d3i8c
t3_6d32j0	t1_di039ri	1495667860	You would save immense amounts of time, effort, energy, and stress by simply having a 3rd party unlock it for you. Yes, you shouldn't have to pay the cost of doing that, I understand. But you've done a lot and they don't seem like they will help you out. They've ran you around in circles and dropped the ball. But there are times in life where you have to take the L and this is one of them in my opinion.   Now if you simply will not consider this and think it's something Apple/ATT/Tracphone should handle, then I'd recommend selling the phone to someone who has that carrier and get some money for it at least.	KristapsIsGod	t3_6d32j0

t3_6d32j0	t1_di03uu9	1495668610	It actually is apparently one of the bigger ones and is not part of another unfortunately, dealing with any of the main four would have been much easier.	whoamanwtf	t1_di03f35
t3_6d32j0	t1_di03vsx	1495668645	My worry is the third party will not work either.	whoamanwtf	t1_di039ri
t3_6d32j0	t1_di04477	1495668945	I think you should try your luck on a cell unlocking website. Create a new PayPal for it and use a fake name.	Curlywurlywoo	t1_di03uu9
t3_6d32j0	t1_di079xz	1495672969	Just get it unlocked 3rd party. That just seemed like a lot of hassle. Sometimes it's easier to just to say fuck it.  Yikes man. I need a beer after reading this. Good luck man.	MrRiggs	t3_6d32j0
t3_6d3i8c	t1_di08383	1495674012	i love it, if youre hesitant about the small screen, it only takes like a day to get used to. I switched from a moto x pure 2015 for perspective lol. biggg ass phone. se is really fast	Zakworm1	t3_6d3i8c

t3_6d32j0	t1_di0aiy5	1495677208	Yeah, it has been quite the process. I guess I just had more faith in Apple, it was apparently misplaced.	whoamanwtf	t1_di079xz

t3_6d32j0	t1_di0ep9q	1495682904	Yikes, your story could use some editing. Holy shit man. Bullet points. We don't need every single detail.   Straight talk/Tracfone iPhones are activation locked. If you bought it from Walmart/wherever it is locked. Straight talk/tracfone requires you to have service with them for 1 full year (paid) before they will unlock the phone. I have never seen anyone successfully get out of this. I would guess that you got some sort of deal when you bought it... Gift card, etc. It's locked. You're boned.   iPhones that you buy from Apple are not necessarily unlocked, unless specified... Or unless you buy the Verizon version. Apple usually doesn't start selling unlocked iPhones until a few weeks after launch.	tdmoney	t3_6d32j0

t3_6d456b	t1_di0hblq	1495687149	Probably dropped with the headphone jack in the port. Probably fine, but this will most likely make it ineligible for Apple display replacement.	denthar	t3_6d456b
t3_6d32j0	t1_di0iag9	1495688945	It was not a TracFone iPhone it was a universal and paid for completely meaning they had no right to lock it and said so themselves. If you go by model number it's actually three Verizon one.  Apple has told me numerous times at this point that they agreed it should not have been locked and a rep even told me before that it was an ATT phone, which would be fantastic as that's what I'm trying to use.	whoamanwtf	t1_di0ep9q
t3_6d32j0	t1_di0ibj7	1495689002	Thanks for the kind thoughts, I will update this once I have any progress made. Have been speaking with someone else from Apple since reaching out to social media again.	whoamanwtf	t1_di0fo29

t3_6d32j0	t1_di0joui	1495691874	Right, there's no such thing as a Straight Talk/Tracfone iPhone... They are the Verizon or ATT versions... But if you buy it from them (like it sounds like you did) they are activation locked to Straight Talk/Tracfone. You probably got some sort of "deal" when you bought it... Like a Wal Mart gift card or something.   You did not buy an unlocked iPhone. The ONLY way that you could have bought an unlocked iPhone on launch day is to have bought one from Verizon (or bought the Verizon version from an apple store and stuck a Verizon sim card in it...). If you would have bought your phone from ATT, TMobile, Sprint they would have been locked also (although most will unlock it if you don't owe anything on it or don't have a contract on it). You can/will go round and round with Apple and Straight Talk.... They will not help you. Straight Talk are the only ones that can unlock the phone and they won't do it unless you've had it on their service for 1 year.   You can try to 3rd party unlocking services, but I have my doubts as to whether they'll work on an iPhone 7. Most of those just literally do the thing that you can do to get it unlocked yourself for free... They literally put in a request to the carrier. There could very well be some sort of jailbreak shenanigans that work for this... that I'm not sure of/have no experience with.	tdmoney	t1_di0iag9
t3_6cs9ov	t1_di0kapg	1495693231	I switched from android too. The only problem is that, android felt like my phone, and iPhone feels like just a phone. Do you have simillar feeling?	mlecz	t1_dhxe3xl
t3_6d456b	t1_di0kvcm	1495694550	Aluminum is a soft metal. It dents like that ridiculously easily.  My phone has similar pitting like the photo in the OP from sliding out my pocket five inches onto the concrete I was sitting on.	-Badger2-	t1_di09mhn
t3_6cs9ov	t1_di0labc	1495695518	That is one thing I miss a little. I was using Nova Launcher with some icon packs. But, having my phone be so responsive and almost always just work exactly like I expect it to is well worth it.	letsgometros	t1_di0kapg
t3_6d3i8c	t1_di0m33j	1495697456	The SE is powerful for a small phone (Same processor as your 6S, but with less pixels to drive,) unlike the Android world right now where smaller phones are often built with less powerful SoCs.  Just keep in mind you'll be losing Force Touch and the front camera is a little worse.  That said, I love mine. Grabbed it at like a $250 (Canadian) discount when my carrier was clearing stock on the 64GB units a little ahead of Apple's announcement of the 32/128 models.	itsadile	t3_6d3i8c
t3_6d3i8c	t1_di0nc3d	1495700803	Bought the 32gb version a month ago and the phone runs like a champ! Design wise you know the story, you either love it or hate it. Only iphone I had before this was the iphone 4 some years ago, loved the format of that phone and the build quality.Since then i had a couple of windows phones, androids but i always wanted a small form factor phone but a powerful one. Only one that came close was the Sony xperia compact z3. I am not a heavy user i mostly read my emails, check reddit, browse the web, take a couple of pictures from time to time and the battery life is very good, i have never had a phone with a better battery life so far. currently it's sitting at 19% with 6h30m of screen on time and 52h20m of standby, oh and i am running 10.3.1(10.3.2 is available). the phone is fast, very fast! and reliable so far and i am very pleased with my purchase as i always wanted a small form factor phone with excellent performance and reliability and no bullshit OS with 100's of customizations. i would say go for it and buy one if you like the form factor and want something with excellent battery life.  Think of it like this and ask yourself what do you want from your phone? - Do i want a small form factor phone that i can easily slip into the pocket and operate it with one hand with no issues at all? - Do i want a phone with excellent battery life? - Need a good rear camera? - Do not mind a 4inch screen in the era of 5inch and above screens?  If the answer to all of the above is 'Yes' then buy it! :)  If you play on your phone a lot you might not like the small screen, if you like to take selfies you might not like the front facing camera.   I dare to say that overall this phone is made for 'mature audiences'.	rawlemonade	t3_6d3i8c
t3_6d3i8c	t1_di0nwta	1495702447	I love it. Went from 5s to SE and the difference in speed and camera is amazing.

How much space is available on your phone? 3. Does it load all the threads or does it crash in the middle of downloading?	alfcho	t1_di0jiw5
t3_6d3i8c	t1_di0q6mp	1495708662	I switched from Android with my LG G4. My last iPhone was the 4S when that was new.  I am 100% satisfied. There are still one or two things I can't do on iOS which I could on Android, but nothing major at all. My SE is the perfect size, a pleasure to hold, quick to charge, slow to discharge, decent camera, and extremely fast indeed.  No regrets at all.   I don't understand the design being dated a problem - it's still far better looking than any other phone out there at the moment.	loosebolts	t3_6d3i8c

t3_6dbcyp	t1_di1c2yx	1495737350	I believe the "eligible for upgrade" means you've either completed an old 2 year contract, or you've paid off enough of your current device.

t3_6dbcyp	t1_di1irs4	1495744696	The every-two-year upgrade only makes sense if you get a discount (e.g. on Black Friday, they were offering the iPhone 7 for $240 over two years if you stayed with Verizon). They run promos occasionally, but mostly on budget phones, or on deals that require a trade-in to get the promo price.	pr0grammer	t3_6dbcyp
t3_6dbcyp	t1_di1j8he	1495745227	Welcome to the fun new world of phone upgrades. It's all for you though. It's really about freedom for the customer. Before you had to wait two whole years to upgrade. You only had to pay $199 upfront for the phone...but two damn years!!! And contracts, no more contracts. Just sign up for this simple monthly device payment plan (with a contract to pay for your phone) and you can upgrade as soon as you pay the full retail value of the phone...I mean whenever you want.

t3_6dbcyp	t1_di1slmn	1495756961	You've always been paying the full price (or close to it), in effect by having your monthly plan higher than it otherwise would be. Plans now are roughly $20- $40 cheaper. the main difference now is that the cost of the phone is more explicit and not always hidden. Before, you'd "pay off" the discount they give you on the phone and they'd still keep your plan higher until you upgraded again.   Look at your plan, look at Verizon's website for newer plans. Compare. Look at competitor options. Call them and ask if they can offer any special rates for staying.	my02	t3_6dbcyp
t3_6dbcyp	t1_di1t1vz	1495757578	You've always paid full price, they just subsidized the upfront cost and baked their reimbursement into the monthly service fees. Now this is done directly by breaking the full cost up over two years.  If you are on an old plan, you should look at the new Verizon plans. You'll almost certainly save money by removing the subsidy charges built into your old plan.	kevinyeaux	t3_6dbcyp
t3_6dbcyp	t1_di1t7m6	1495757799	This seriously needs to be the top comment. You were basically paying off the phone in two years (more if you didn't upgrade after two years, less if you got a deal off the phone initially) because they put hidden costs in your line fees.	sentretluva	t1_di1slmn

t3_6dbcyp	t1_di1w3id	1495761685	To address the "paying full price for a phone isn't an upgrade" argument, you were always paying full price for the phone you got but instead of being upfront and making payments on the phone the carriers just charged $40 access fees on every line. Now those fees are $20 and you pay for the phone in a more transparent manner. It does kinda suck because you have to pay taxes on the phone that day instead of being able to pay $1 and walk out with a new phone.	TexasRed21	t3_6dbcyp

Also, my iPhone can do everything my android devices can do and security is one of my main concerns on smartphones. I carry important data on my phone for work and if I were to lose my phone, I rather the thief not be able to access my phone like you can on android devices.

When they are adults with families PDF their own you can be friends. Kids need guidance not friendship from their parents when being raised. This ridiculous liberal attitude is a big part of why we as a society are in the place we are. Your supposed to invade their space. Your supposed to be involved in what's happening in their lives.  Good and bad. They are supposed to get mad at you. That's how it works. They will thank you for it one day. Go ahead down vote me.

t3_6dow8f	t1_di4h1we	1495917752	Yahoo is cute and to the point.   Weather Channel  has a very good map (except they mess with the colors now and then) the videos are cute but the rest of the layout is annoying AF - and can't be changed.   Wx underground is VERY good, but the map is somewhat annoying and not exactly intuitive. However their shining star is the "smart forecast" which you can configure and customize for example you can set to show only sunny / no clouds / temp range so you can plan for hammock weather (!!) you can also change the layout - very convenient.   Accuweather is nice and configurable and the map is the LEAST annoying.   They can almost all be set to no ads with a "purchase".   There's also QuakeWatch and a zillion more.  Almost all the wx apps have a "lite" version so it can get confusing.  ALL of them get info from the NWS anyway; but Wunderground also has a network of "hobbyists" with wx stations reporting in so they parse all the data for better coverage within a few BLOCKS.   And for fun there's Effing Weather.	therealsoundoctor	t3_6dow8f

t3_6dow8f	t1_di4hw9m	1495919026	In a recent update they added weather underground data as well. So you can choose dark sky or weather underground for the hourly and daily forecast. They still use dark sky for the next hour of precipitation if it's precipitating. For this reason, in my eyes it's by far the best weather app on the App Store.	james_honey_comby	t1_di4ftpm

Reasons I prefer it... grippy flexi case, lightening port, always using the case battery first, integrated battery iOS indicator, allowing both to charge at the same time if there's enough amps and no button for the case charge.

t3_6dme8w	t1_di5ar7n	1495979218	Right, to 0%. Coming from the RC world, we usually charge our batteries to 4.2v and call them "dead" at 3.7v. I would be very surprised if Apple didn't do the same thing for the batteries.

t3_6drq9d	t1_di5m6o9	1495995575	I have it for the 7 and it's the best battery case I've ever seen on an iPhone since I first used a third-party one for the 3GS but I never stuck with a battery case for more than a few months until the Apple smart case. With moderate use I still have juice left in the case plus 100% in the phone itself. Charge at night and you're good to go. With heavy use I might go into the phone's actual battery but that's rare. In case you forget to charge you can pluck the phone out of the case and just charge the case while you use your phone and then pop it back in when the case it's done charging.   What's great is you never have to take compromises with your phone. I never turn off wifi, I have app refresh on for any app that matters, I keep the brightness high, etc.   Last thing is people mocked the design when it first came out due to the "hump" but it really makes it feel ergonomic. It never feels as bulky as third party cases.	Darth_Vorador	t3_6drq9d

t3_6drq9d	t1_di64ylr	1496023392	I've had several different kinds and they all have the same basic flaws (not everyone has all the flaws but they all have some of them): the two-piece units eventually break down; the USB port fails, usually sooner than I'd like, they're so tight you can barely get your phone in and out and they're clunky.  I got fed up with this series of failures and got the apple version. I haven't had it too long, but it's comfortable, it's easy to get on and off, the battery seems to last forever, and the lightning makes life easy for a lot of things. Oh, and almost forgot and this is a big deal for me: most of these idiot designs have a deep, narrow channel for the earphone jack. If you use something with an L shape, forget it (hence the value of slipping the apple version off easily). If you use something with a fat jack, forget it (see above parenthetical comment).  It was a necessary idea for many people, but the tradeoffs to use Mophie or anyone else are just not worth it. Apple's solution, despite the bump that took so much ridicule, is by far the best I've come across.	DevilBoyNC	t3_6drq9d

t3_6e0cvs	t1_di6ns7v	1496066141	Agreed. I have the S8 and the 7+ and I gotta say, Apple needs some serious work on it.   I just checked something, I have the same apps on both devices and they both have the same notification settings. On the S8, I kinda have a resume on who messaged/emailed me. On the iPhone I have to scroll to find who messaged/emailed me. I just end up clearing the notifications from the iPhone and use the Galaxy to check the notification and if I have to respond, I grab the iPhone (I feel that the app quality in Android is not so good.

t3_6e0gxi	t1_di6ol0n	1496067462	I'm probably speaking really out of turn, but I think the focus of this year's model will be on:  - battery life + charging - screen estate in form factor - camera functionality and performance - crazy chip performance (as always from Apple) - a more thoughtful iOS experience (notifications and FaceTime functionality)   I think unbreakable glass and waterproofing, whilst nice are probably backseat and might be so for many users.

t3_6e0gxi	t1_di6utbg	1496076298	That is probably true but the are also a lot of people who smash their screen which would increase with sapphire glass. I think the scratches are barely noticeable most of the time too and I personally use a screen protector which I can change if it get scratched (which it hasn't so far).  It does depend on the person but I don't think Apple would add a sapphire screen on something as droppable as an iPhone. On the watch it's attached to your wrist so you don't really drop it.	canamar	t1_di6ul9v
t3_6e0gxi	t1_di6v51k	1496076720	We have had sapphire watch faces forever. I've broken two and they were about 1/8" thick or so.  The iPhone screen will be thinner. I don't see it being significantly less breakable than the current glass.  I've only broken one screen in nearly ten years. Things tend to break when dropped. Maybe Apple should work on anti-gravity phones to keep the screens from breaking.	kramfive	t1_di6ssxs

t3_6e0abp	t1_di6x6oy	1496079319	I stopped using it mostly because of ridiculous battery issues, but also because I would occasionally hold my phone up to see some kind of audio playing, just without any sound. It had a garbage name and 0.00 playtime, but it was still playing and could be paused.   I could unlock the phone and be at home screen, lock the screen, turn it on again and the audio was playing again.   Soon discovered that if I force quit he Facebook app, that audio file would stop showing up on the lock screen as well.   Seems these hour or longer background run times were from whatever this silent audio file playing was.   Deleted that app and will never be on my phone again.	Darkdragoonlord	t1_di6vbgq

t3_6e0abp	t1_di6xol6	1496079958	&gt; The devs working on this app are disgrace to the industry.  Bit harsh.

t3_6e0abp	t1_di6yy0d	1496081601	There is a difference between a hybrid app and a web client. First of all, hybrid apps don't have to be downloaded every time, taking a lot of strain from network traffic. They can have push notifications and use device functiona like Contacts and Photos, which are harder if not impossible to use from a browser. Using a hybrid app in a app format is a lot easier than using a web client, because you don't have the browser zoom, tabs and other controls to worry about.   If it's just a small web client packed into an app, I agree. Not every website needs an app. But correctly used hybrid apps are closer in comparison to native apps than to web clients, as they're usually a way of making a "native" app and not having to do everything over for every platform. The language isn't the main factor IMO, it's the content.	lukee910	t1_di6wr11

t3_6e0abp	t1_di70o9k	1496083860	Sorry but what are you on about ?  People expect mobile apps to be more responsive than a web page. And so the idea is that for a news feed browser you need to aggressively precache upcoming items. And maintain that cache for the next launch (since people jump between apps). Go build a news feed yourself and try it. If you don't cache it will be unusable.   The same happens on a web browser it's just not as easy to get a breakdown of cache utilisation by website. Especially because of shared assets eg. JQuery and the heavy use of CDNs.   Also Facebook is renowned for having some of the best developers in the industry and gave us some amazing technologies eg. React, Cassandra, HBase, Flow, GraphQL. So maybe give them the benefit of the doubt before pretending to know their use cases.   Source: you likely have an app I built on your phone.	threeseed	t1_di6rtnd
t3_6e0abp	t1_di70pua	1496083919	If using the app means I can stay logged out in the browser and therefore avoid the on-the-web tracking of places like google and Facebook, that's a plus. Of course, apps have their own ways of tracking you so it may not be a net win.	baubleclaw	t1_di6wr11
t3_6e0abp	t1_di70slg	1496084019	I really wish Apple would add the option to manually clear an app's cache. The current system of waiting until my phone has NO space to scrub apps is useful but it definitely needs a manual trigger.	Watchmaker_2112	t3_6e0abp

t3_6e0abp	t1_di70wk3	1496084165	I don't think you understand what that means. Background means when the app itself was not at the forefront not background tasks.

In another tab.	threeseed	t1_di6vbgq

t3_6e0abp	t1_di71een	1496084824	Facebook is a news feed browser. Something that I've just seen on my wall is probably the first and the last time I'm ever gonna see it. Also it will be irrelevant in an hour, and completely forgotten by next week. The FB app cache under no circumstances should ever exceed 100MB (which is still plenty, considering app like this doesn't need a cache at all). 1GB is a *lot* of data considering its just some text and compressed as fuck images. And FYI, this fb cache doesn't speed up anything, if I launch fresh instance of fb it takes like 5-7  seconds to load up which is ridiculous considering the crazy amount of stored cache, the broadband speed and the resources available.  Source: I've built quite a few websites, including multilanuage eshops with thousands of products and they were nowhere near 1GB even with a month of caches.	majnus	t1_di70o9k
t3_6e0abp	t1_di71m1p	1496085105	In short, background means when the user's not actively using it. It isn't the app displaying on screen.  So that's roughly an extra 25% of processing power for, what - a few notifications that someone's posted something?  I continue to be dubious that's worthwhile.	ieya404	t1_di70wk3
t3_6e0abp	t1_di71qu4	1496085281	Well you cracked it. Never worked on a iOS app before but knows better than Facebook developers i.e. the most popular third party app.  And as someone who doesn't use Facebook all that often my cache is 85MB. Almost like caches are proportional to how frequently they are used. Especially since the iOS automatically manages the eviction and so it largely isn't an issue.	threeseed	t1_di71een
t3_6e0abp	t1_di72536	1496085809	Notifications are handled server side.  So it's likely just precaching the news feed.	threeseed	t1_di71m1p
t3_6e0abp	t1_di7289b	1496085923	It doesn't , the ios has  function that automatically goes over your apps and delete caches and temp files once it sees you don't have space for new data , this app mimics this function and does a procedure in which the iPhone thinks there's a new large file so it does what it's programmed to do. In the past there was a "Cheat" of doing it by renting a large movie from the official movie app so that the system will prepare the space needed for download but that is no longer an option I think . But this app is the only one I found that does that. I use it frequently for over a year	downnheavy	t1_di70u7m

t3_6e0abp	t1_di72pds	1496086563	I don't need to be an iOS app dev to know how caches work. Check out "friendly" (3rd party fb app). It's not even 30MB (as opposed to FB base app of almost 300MB) and stores almost no cache, and guess what? Yea, it's just as fast, if not faster. And works with messages, not like fb that needs a separate standalone app that weights another few hundred MBs + unreasonable amount of caches.  I'll say it again: fb app devs are awful.	majnus	t1_di71qu4
t3_6e0abp	t1_di7312w	1496086992	Harder to block ads inside the app, but on the flip side, if you are logged in *only* via the app, Facebook etc don't have access to your browsing habits the way they do if you're logged in on the web and visit pages with Facebook share buttons and google ads.   (But a good ad blocker helps with the latter)	baubleclaw	t1_di72jxb

t3_6e0abp	t1_di7bl6j	1496098386	In addition to just issues on Facebook's end, I think Apple/Developers need to add a feature that allows you to clear the cache. It would help immensely with storage issues and would save the time of deleting and re-downloading apps.	pattymea	t3_6e0abp

t3_6e0abp	t1_di7djan	1496101198	Nothing is stopping you viewing it in a browser is it? Just uninstall the app and bookmark https://m.facebook.com - chrome even lets you make a homescreen shortcut from the bookmark (on android anyway) so it's easy to launch, and will let the website still show you notifications if you allow it. I haven't noticed any nags promoting the app, although a lot of other mobile sites certainly have them (fucking tumblr with their abomination of a mobile version - I would install their app if it didn't look like they purposely made the site awful to drive you to the app).   I did that months ago, and it works quite well. Although I disabled notifications started wasting less time on FB, which might be a benefit the devs don't want you to have.	alienangel2	t1_di6wr11
t3_6e0abp	t1_di7dv3s	1496101674	Yeah not sure what he's smoking. News feeds nowadays are 99% images and video, and people scroll through stuff they've scrolled through before. It makes perfect sense to be caching it. If they didn't performance would be shittier, and people with limited data would be refusing to use the app.   And in what world is 1 GB of cache a crazily high  amount for 2017 anyway? I have a lot to dislike about the Facebook app, but its caching seems completely reasonable.	alienangel2	t1_di6xol6

t3_6e0abp	t1_di7kg30	1496110332	Yep! Deleted the app after they were forcing the messenger download. Facebook.com/home.php works for what I need. I rarely even use Facebook now that I've deleted the app, but when I do check it, that desktop mobile link works well and I can message.

t3_6e0cvs	t1_di7spto	1496124225	The beauty with Android Notifications is that you can handle the notifications for the most part without launching the app. I find in ios, you have to hit the notification, which launches the app, then you can interact with whatever it is you need to - on Android, in most cases you can interact with the notification directly.   Sounds insignificant, but makes the daily flow of notifications way more management and efficient.	cipher29	t3_6e0cvs

I could see the now ubiquitous glow of my screen beneath the distinct porta potty blue and floating pieces of poo. Without much more than a seconds thought I dived in (figure of speech, right arm only) and pulled it out. I did my best to dry it off with toilet paper and a short while after that I spent a considerable time cleaning / disinfecting it with hand sanitizer. It worked for the rest of tour / enlistment + another couple years under a new owner (they were informed of the whole story). Since then I've had some pretty great luck with the exception of an SE that died in pocket when exposed to water. I'm 7+ now because I've been dreaming for years for a water resistant phone.	onnoonesword	t3_6e5j5d

t3_6e96dx	t1_di8nqco	1496173810	Oh yeah, the first week I was in love, it was new and fun and the design was brilliant, but after the novelty wore off, I was left missing the fantastic simplicity of iOS.

t3_6e96dx	t1_di8nwes	1496173994	Did the exact same thing. I'm a big pixels and display guy so naturally the S8 was a dream in the regard but here we are a day before my return period and I have a Red iPhone 7 Plus 128 in my hands.	humanhymns	t1_di8nqco
t3_6e96dx	t1_di8nx3v	1496174014	Hell yeah, by the time September rolls in, I'll have settled back into iOS and I can really appreciate the (hopefully) brand new design of the iPhone 8.	MyNaMeIsJoe90	t1_di8nrzm

t3_6e96dx	t1_di8osp0	1496174974	I find Android apps to be far better designed with more options to choose from (reddit apps for example).

KUSH_DELIRIUM	t1_di8nqco
t3_6e96dx	t1_di8oujf	1496175030	The Pixel was pretty nice. I used one for about 7 months before switching back. It comes down to service and ecosystem for me. Apple does service better, and I am way too deep into the ecosystem to make switching easy.	dhall99	t1_di8nt13
t3_6e96dx	t1_di8p1is	1496175250	True, stock Android is the best type. The Pixel is a step in the right direction. I guess it's up to personal preference. I prefer having one really good official app, rather than having third party developers having to make client apps because the stock one is badly designed or buggy.	MyNaMeIsJoe90	t1_di8osp0

t3_6e96dx	t1_di8phn9	1496175752	I think a few years ago the official apps on Android were considerably worse than the iOS versions but now I feel like the difference in negligible at worst for pretty much all the popular apps except for Snapchat. Gaming is definitely better on iOS though. IMO Android would have a better user experience than iOS if it had an iMessage equivalent (that isn't half-assed). Excited to see where it is when it's time for me to get a new phone (because I greatly prefer material design), but I still worry that iMessage will keep me from switching lol.	KUSH_DELIRIUM	t1_di8p1is
t3_6e96dx	t1_di8pmp8	1496175907	Hit the nail on the head there. Android really needs to catch up when it comes to messaging. Needs a universal standard that all the manufacturers can use. A new Google messaging app or something. Because iMessage is awesome. And for better or worse, some people do stay with Apple because of it.	MyNaMeIsJoe90	t1_di8phn9
t3_6e96dx	t1_di8qct4	1496176708	Hahah I was the same, I've had the best of the best. iOS brings me stability lol, used to buy a new phone every4 months seriously when it came to android	squall2099	t3_6e96dx
t3_6e96dx	t1_di8qfdh	1496176787	I also had the S8 for about 3 weeks then switched back to an iPhone 7 Plus (had a 7 before getting the S8). Felt the same way, loved the screen, camera was great, liked the new differences Android has from iOS. The phone *felt* beautiful in the hand.  But it was the little, and sometimes big, things I missed from iPhone that made me go back.  Damned near everyone I know has an iPhone, so iMessage was perfect. Google's messaging direction is....disturbing.  Fingerprint sensor was better on the S8 compared to the S7, but having it on the back was strange. I got used to it, but for me, I use and unlock my phone while it's on my desk at work, so the front home button on iPhone is a winner there.  Apps definitely work better and smoother on iPhone, even Google apps.   I'm really excited for the next iPhone, especially since they got lazy with the 7 and reused a (at the time) 2 year old design.	moonknlght	t1_di8nfu6

t3_6e96dx	t1_di8qk9e	1496176939	Switched from Android to Iphone. Was told iMessage would be the best thing ever. Have used it once but none of my iPhone friends really use it.  WhatsApp seems to be king in my family/friends circles.	Leechylemonface	t1_di8pmp8
t3_6e96dx	t1_di8qmza	1496177024	Yeah, I'm really hoping for that edge to edge display with the fingerprint scanner built in under the glass. I mean, they pretty much have to give us a massive screen now that Android phones are ditching the bezels.	MyNaMeIsJoe90	t1_di8qfdh

t3_6e96dx	t1_di8szo9	1496179710	The 7 is my first iPhone and I love how it functions. Just everything about it. Now the one hope I have is they go back to the squared off body. My fiancée has the 5 and I just love the design. Oh and level out the camera please. Protruding camera. Not a fan.	Shattered_Skies	t3_6e96dx

t3_6e96dx	t1_di8wvck	1496184439	Yeah, it's the apps and smoothness that keep pulling me back too. Every time I mess with my S7 Edge or Nexus 6P it just bugs me so much that scrolling in 3rd party apps like Facebook or Tumblr is so much worse than in iOS. If only iOS had Android's home screen customization, notification system, and ability to change default apps I'd have no reason to switch.	KalenXI	t1_di8nqco
t3_6e96dx	t1_di8wz73	1496184575	Home screen and notifications don't bother me too much (I love the red badges on app icons for notifications even if the notification centre isn't great) but ability to set default applications would be really nice.	MyNaMeIsJoe90	t1_di8wvck
t3_6e96dx	t1_di8x2ex	1496184688	For me the badges on Android is solved with a custom home screen since Nova Launcher has a plugin for that. Plus I think they're adding native support for badges in Android O. I hate iOS' notification center so much though. It's so disorganized that it's almost completely useless for me if I even remember to look there at all because there's no icon indicating that I have a notification like on Android.

t3_6e96dx	t1_di8x9h3	1496184935	If Samsung released a phone with pure, stock android they would fucking obliterate the high end android market. Samsung hardware is unrivaled, the software is just bloated and slow.  I don't know a single person who would rather use a pixel if the S8 ran the same version of Android.	lapotronic	t1_di8nt13

t3_6e96dx	t1_di8xqhd	1496185547	After having the Nexus 6P (and the problem with a bending body/battery issues) it's actually the exact reason I switched to Apple. Lol.	bkosh84	t1_di8rpur
t3_6e96dx	t1_di8xvq9	1496185735	Lol, this thread is so sad, all these people with the need to pat each other on the shoulder because they have phone X 😂.

Is_every_name_used	t3_6e96dx
t3_6e96dx	t1_di8xxts	1496185809	Its because people in Europe usually stay on prepaid plans that offer limited messaging and feel that iMessage will cost them.	trumptard2	t1_di8tw2e

t3_6e96dx	t1_di8y4zi	1496186067	lol I did the same thing! I have Jump!OnDemand from T-Mobile. I just couldn't give up iOS. I was under the assumption I'm just getting too old to keep switching... but it looks like I'm not alone! :D	G3TG0T	t1_di8nfu6
t3_6e96dx	t1_di8y9pm	1496186238	And they get updates for the next three years. Good luck with Android.	trumptard2	t1_di8venu
t3_6e96dx	t1_di8ydh7	1496186375	This thread is specifically related to the topic of switching, so hearing people talk about why they like iPhone or why they feel the need to stick with one is very relevant. However we can talk about tips and new apps too, let's keep it open for all types of contribution.	MyNaMeIsJoe90	t1_di8xvq9

t3_6e96dx	t1_di903m6	1496188588	I love switching too, but I keep crawling back to Android.. I find iOS a bit too boring after a while. That being said, if you ask me what phone I would recommend to majority of people, it's iPhone 100%. That thing is just so predictable, it's perfect for most people. And when it has special features (3D touch, dual camera) the features are so well implemented that people do not need to learn about them.  but yea, for a tech enthusiast like myself, it's android all the way..	matus201	t3_6e96dx

t3_6e96dx	t1_di90gxv	1496189068	I recently came to the same conclusion, I had an iPhone4 for a few years then switched to a Windows phone out of curiosity and while I quite liked the Icon, the lack of support for Windows from carriers and the new Apple offering brought me back with the 7.	almace038	t3_6e96dx
t3_6cvd3i	t1_di90ru6	1496189460	Hey, I have released a new version of the app with crash tracking. Can you try uninstalling the app and redownloading it again?  Thanks!	alfcho	t3_6cvd3i

t3_6e96dx	t1_di91sx8	1496190787	Just use what you want. If that's what you're used to, then it doesn't matter.  I personally can't stand iOS, everyone has their preferences. No shame in using either.	ldAbl	t3_6e96dx

t3_6e96dx	t1_di92dho	1496191532	I just switched from the 3T to the iPhone 7. Honestly, the 3T is better in almost every way except for messaging and in-hand feel. I do really like the 7, though, so I'm sticking with it for now.	ggKevin	t1_di8y2it
t3_6e96dx	t1_di92ivk	1496191735	I had a oneplus 3 before this..the only reason I didn't like it was because it lacked wifi calling..and I guess the 3t has it..  Idk, the 3t is a really nice looking phone..and as much as I despise google, I kinda miss android..	SocksNUrToaster	t1_di92dho
t3_6e96dx	t1_di92q2u	1496192003	I love google, but I've been getting really impatient with them. They keep ignoring major problems such as fragmentation and no real messaging solution.	ggKevin	t1_di92ivk
t3_6e96dx	t1_di92x5q	1496192259	What do you mean? They have like 30 messaging solutions ;)  They pissed me off first when they dropped google tv And they continued to not care that I spent 100s of dollars on a product of theirs and dropped support, and I hate that their business model is to learn every aspect of every person on this earth. Just freaks me out..and as much as they do have a fragmentation problem, and can't figure out the best name for a program that allows you to communicate..I do love their product, maybe even more than iOS.   And, I couldn't and still can't get over how damn pretty the 3t is. But even all of that combined, I know in 6 months oneplus is going to say f you to the 3 and 3t and there will never be support for it again..and that's what holds me back	SocksNUrToaster	t1_di92q2u

t3_6ebqo3	t1_di94wlk	1496194890	I used to use Google Music, until i started experiencing frustrating glitches like being unable to restart tracks and song sometimes stopping entirely. I've since switched to Spotify.	hozznad	t3_6ebqo3
t3_6ebqo3	t1_di94zkl	1496195000	I really like Spotify, but I dislike that there isn't something as simple as the ability to shuffle various stations.   I like to mix up my variety of music without having to create a playlist for every different scenario.	yomandenver	t1_di94wlk
t3_6ebqo3	t1_di95p7q	1496195953	I also switched from Songza to Spotify. However, my beef is that I can load music onto an iPod Shuffle for running.	surSEXECEN	t1_di94wlk
t3_6ebqo3	t1_di95uja	1496196148	Apple Music. I was usually spending ~$20 a month on music anyway, and Spotify/Pandora annoyed me because of the limited skips, the ads, and because they acted more like a radio than a personal library. AM is exactly what I want it to be.	WinterVision	t3_6ebqo3
t3_6e0cvs	t1_di9622y	1496196434	That's a great point! I was struggling to effectively communicate that clearly.	Vincere31	t1_di7spto
t3_6ebqo3	t1_di96s8m	1496197433	Spotify. Cross platform handoff is really useful, they have all the music I listen to, high quality for audiophiles, and a ton of discounts if $10 a month is too much.	cooperred	t3_6ebqo3
t3_6drgx0	t1_di977vd	1496198032	That's because when your input is in English Siri uses Wolfram Alpha for processing, Wolfram can do currency conversion and many other things. When using a different language Siri will only use Apple's input processing which is very limited and usually prefers to give a search result.	kadupse	t1_di5q8ks

t3_6ecium	t1_di9dsro	1496208894	Who is your cell phone provider?  There are a lot of good deals out there.  All 4 major (US) carriers offer iPhone upgrades every year.   Verizon iPhones are already unlocked, and depending on where you purchase the phone, some big box stores offer "universal carrier" iPhones (which lock to whatever SIM card you activate it with, but if you pay off the device, your carrier can unlock it).	rsmseries	t3_6ecium
t3_6ebqo3	t1_di9effh	1496210278	I use Spotify, SoundCloud, and Apple Music. But I mainly use Apple Music.   Whenever I'm driving or listening to music by myself, Apple Music. SoundCloud or Spotify when I'm using my phone at parties or gathering and it's hooked up to a speaker. They both have great mixes but I'm really not digging the sudden increase in ads on Spotify.	kylevchapman	t3_6ebqo3

t3_6ecium	t1_di9fdfy	1496212468	I can't answer your first two questions, however I recently moved back to the iPhone for the first time since the 4. My last android device was the GS6, and while it looked nice I hated the battery life, it never felt like it performed all that well, and I was never able to find an SMS app that made me happy.   A big selling point on my return to the iPhone is Apple's stance on encryption and privacy, it's a big deal and I appreciate that Apple pays so much attention to it. The stuff I do miss though are the widgets on the home screen (it's a minor peeve of mine to swipe over to get to my widgets), and the ease of downloading and using ringtones from services like Zedge (the iPhone Zedge app is awful).   All in all though, I haven't had a second thought about switching back. The lack of a headphone jack in the 7 really doesn't bother me since most of my headphones were already wireless. I get more than respectable battery life, Apple's SMS app is wonderful, I've finally found a Reddit app that I like (Readder), and it's nice that they finally came out with a waterproof iPhone.

t3_6ecium	t1_di9qns7	1496238038	If you're going to be traveling all over the world, I'd recommend making sure you are getting the CDMA-capable iPhone. The iPhones sold for use on T-Mobile and AT&amp;T do not have these extra radios, and won't be as flexible even after unlocking them.	jtl_bert	t3_6ecium
t3_6ecium	t1_di9r7q2	1496238761	I've been happy with Verizon iPhones using their Travel Pass add-on with an iPhone SE, 6, and 7. Travel Pass may be a little more expensive than buying a local SIM, but it works automatically with your own data allowance and phone number. People back home can text and call my regular number as if I'm still in the states. I just buy a local SIM in countries that aren't covered by Travel Pass.	davbak	t3_6ecium

t3_6efek3	t1_di9ucka	1496242507	SE is basically 6S in a small shell. 6S has 4.7 inch, I'll say not to smalll since you've been using android phones (5inch above screen size). Well it depends. I'm using the 7 plus right now, the battery could last me through the day (9 to 6). I've held the SE and it's so tiny!	Sempot	t1_di9u69o
t3_6ed3j5	t1_di9udts	1496242546	Hope iOS 11 improves the iPhone 7 experience, I'm not liking the 7+.	CamiloTiria	t1_di9ubcz
t3_6efek3	t1_di9ueno	1496242573	But if the SE is the one you could afford, get that instead I guess? Then use the extra money to buy battery cases or power banks, heck a magnifying glass if you want	Sempot	t1_di9u69o
t3_6ed3j5	t1_di9ufe2	1496242597	Actually this year we have no clue how big/small the changes on iOS 11 will be.Worth the wait though.	AndyCR19	t1_di9udts
t3_6ed3j5	t1_di9uhjo	1496242662	iOS 10 is pure shit. I think we all need an iOS redesign like iOS 7	CamiloTiria	t1_di9ufe2
t3_6efek3	t1_di9uks9	1496242766	I've lost it at the magnifying glass part, thank you. Yeah, I know I can only afford that right now but I'm willing to punish myself with this phone until I work enough to buy that phone. The iPhone 6S is my dream phone and for that price I think it's really good. And it's even brand new so that's a pretty good deal. I'm really curious what other people say about these two phones because maybe somebody had a really bad experience with one of them  or something like that.	Dogearbox	t1_di9ueno
t3_6edf17	t1_di9uob4	1496242877	I hate Siri. I tell her to play a song, and instead of playing the song that's in my library. She gives me a song off Apple Music that isn't the same song/artist I wanted in my library (even after saying the song/artists name).  Is there any way to fix this ? Besides canceling Apple Music.	BagelBites619	t3_6edf17
t3_6eespb	t1_di9urdh	1496242972	Yeah!!  OP, you (and I) are STUPID!!	twowheels	t1_di9sk1u
t3_6ecium	t1_di9vdfy	1496243663	There's a trade off, you can get the 6s or 6s+ and still have the headphone jack, but the phone isn't waterproof. They do include the adapter for headphones, but I have yet to find a splitter that's inexpensive and well reviewed (Belkin makes one, but it's almost $40).  I really can't think of any glaring negatives, but if I had more wired headphones I can see that being a bummer.	HappyNazgul	t1_di9tkhq
t3_6efek3	t1_di9vxl6	1496244286	Sure thing pal. I'm sure this sub has a lot of SE users	Sempot	t1_di9uks9
t3_6efek3	t1_di9wluh	1496245032	6s Plus! I loved that phone I kinda regret trading in for the 7plus even though I love the portrait mode. The 6 is just so seamless and beautiful all around!	brittersbear	t3_6efek3
t3_6efek3	t1_di9wqj2	1496245172	If your concern is battery, the SE actually has better battery life than the 6s.	Aarondo99	t3_6efek3
t3_6efek3	t1_di9ws8p	1496245223	Your sentence was a little confusing to me, so just in case: the SE has the better battery life of the two. Not as good as the 6s+ but much better than the 6s.    Other than that if you don't want a small screen phone then I think you shouldn't get a small screen phone...If you use your phone a lot, it's a little ridiculous to get something you're not going to enjoy using.	redphan	t3_6efek3
t3_6ecium	t1_di9wst7	1496245240	Your best bet is to buy it from Apple then.  You can buy it in full, or you can finance it through them.  When you buy it in full, you can obviously upgrade whenever you want since you already paid for the phone.	rsmseries	t1_di9tfjr
t3_6edk2a	t1_di9x78q	1496245677	I save space by using safari desktop shortcuts instead of apps whenever I can. Amazon and Facebook for instance are both just shortcuts now-- they are a little different than their app versions, but barely noticeable, and worth it for the extra space.	pudobuq	t3_6edk2a
t3_6edf17	t1_di9x7sk	1496245694	Bummer that still the case. This is the exact reason I canceled my Apple Music subscription.  It's a hard sell, to subscribe to a service that makes Siri less useful.  I guess the other streaming music services don't pollute Siri? Not the answer I want to give you…	interim_descriptor	t1_di9uob4
t3_6edf17	t1_di9xbhx	1496245807	Mine plays songs just fine. Just don't ask her to add them to your library.	AlexTraner	t1_di9uob4
t3_6edk2a	t1_di9xdqz	1496245875	I don't really have a problem with the small memory. I rarely take any pictures or videos. And I started using Spotify, so I can now delete my music files in the phone.	toshi04	t3_6edk2a
t3_6edf17	t1_di9xixr	1496246034	I find, in incidents like this, repeating my request, only slower, works.   I'm starting to wonder if this only happens when Siri "misunderstands" part of the query (ie the blue squiggly correction underlines on some words), as I've noticed sometimes though she got the query right there's the underlines on some words allowing me to change them. I haven't really tested this out, but it's possible in these cases she's only processing part of what you said when searching your music.	DustiiWolf	t1_di9uob4
t3_6eespb	t1_di9xji7	1496246051	It depends heavily on a lot of factors like whether either of you are on cellular or not, and whether the cameras are 720p or 1080p. Data usage will often be a lot smaller than what's in the screenshot.	TheBrainwasher14	t1_di9pvzc
t3_6edk2a	t1_di9xmld	1496246144	The deal breaker for me is Google reducing the size of all my photos. Fuck that. $1 a month is fine	TheBrainwasher14	t1_di9u4u4
t3_6ecium	t1_di9xn2u	1496246160	I recently switched to an iPhone 7+ from a Nexus 6P (and then switched back after 2 months). I wrote up [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/68szn3/if_apple_made_some_hardware_changes_would_you_be/dh2y8k4/) with my experience. Overall I really liked the hardware, but there were a few things about how iOS did things that bugged me. I could definitely see myself switch back again in the future if Apple improves on things like notifications and the ability to set default apps.	JustRollWithIt	t3_6ecium
t3_6edf17	t1_di9xod6	1496246199	Well, it used to work perfectly fine. I used it all the time. But since I got Apple Music (about 4 or 5 months ago?) it always goes to a song in Apple Music with the same title, but a different artist.   Edit: in fact I tried it yesterday, like 5 times, and it kept going to the same wrong song in Apple Music, ignoring my library.	BagelBites619	t1_di9xbhx
t3_6eespb	t1_di9xp68	1496246224	Ok, my concern is when I'm on data. I don't closely monitor my data because I never go over. But I FaceTime more regularly now, so I'll keep closer tabs for a bit	thesmithtopher	t1_di9xji7
t3_6eespb	t1_di9xqu2	1496246274	Definitely do some experimenting. I'm 99% sure Apple detects when you're on cellular and drops the quality of the call to save data.	TheBrainwasher14	t1_di9xp68
t3_6edf17	t1_di9xvxn	1496246435	That's odd! I did a recovery mode update to 10.3.2 that may have helped. (I was too lazy to start as new)	AlexTraner	t1_di9xod6
t3_6dnq0f	t1_di9z9pp	1496247948	I feel like the 2 seconds of time not carrying a wallet around isn't worth calling insurance/credit card companies because someone stole your phone and wallet because you kept the two attached together.   I get it, you're trying to justify your purchase, but you can't honestly believe keeping a $800 phone and your credit cards together is a smart idea.	UniquePebble	t1_di7wkc4
t3_6efek3	t1_di9zcic	1496248030	6s is the better phone. It has a better screen, front camera, and much better reception/LTE. It also has faster Touch ID, stronger 7000 series aluminum, and the Taptic Engine.	B453D	t3_6efek3
t3_6dnq0f	t1_di9zd7h	1496248051	I get what you're saying, but I've been using it fine for nearly a week now. End of the day if it gets stolen it's my fault but my phone never leaves my side so until that day comes I'm perfectly happy with this case.	harley_200	t1_di9z9pp
t3_6efek3	t1_di9ziy3	1496248220	I use my phone a lot, that's the problem. I think I only use my phone for social networking, music and photographing. So these will drain the battery fast, that's my problem with the 6s.I could get used to the small screen but it's always more comfortable to have more space.	Dogearbox	t1_di9ws8p

t3_6efek3	t1_dia1rsd	1496250670	IMO, the difference between 6S and SE still isn't worth that much.  I also made a move from a bigger phone. The switch to SE wasn't that painful and I got accustomed quickly.	worstbdayevr	t1_dia1bys

t3_6ebqo3	t1_dia8len	1496257886	I tried Google play for some time and liked it OK, but then switched to Apple Music. I haven't been thrilled with Apple Music, but it's OK. Huge selection of songs and great integration with the hardware. That said, I've been interested in trying out Spotify because one thing I really love is good curated playlists, and this is where Apple Music seems to lack (the playlists that do exist are short, and getting to them always seems to be way too much work).    My only reservation is that I have a number of Apple Music playlists that I've created which I don't want to lose.   ETA: After reading some of the things here, I decided to give Spotify a try. Doing a three-month trial for $0.99. Will see how it goes. Any tips anyone has for moving from Apple to Spotify are appreciated!	Wdc331	t3_6ebqo3
t3_6eespb	t1_diaa5o0	1496259492	I use FaceTime audio and video every day, and both take way less when you use data than wifi.	emphesym	t1_di9xp68
t3_6edk2a	t1_diaacjm	1496259686	Oh it's not bad at all. And even if you do it full quality you get the usual quota to use which works out to be quite a lot of photos/videos.	Lord_Von_Fappington	t1_dia6orm
t3_6edk2a	t1_diaagkl	1496259800	&gt; you do it full quality  Correct me if I'm wrong but the iphone 7/7+ highest quality is only 12MP. Are you talking about 4k videos?	jackster1232002	t1_diaacjm
t3_6eh6t4	t1_diaas4g	1496260135	The case will almost completely cover up any sign of the red.  There is a product red leather case, though (that tends to age into a weird brown...)	XSSpants	t3_6eh6t4
t3_6eespb	t1_diacmt1	1496262089	Yeah these calls are all from the same person.	DJDOUBLM	t1_di9zxje
t3_6edk2a	t1_diadkvj	1496263123	Especially with bluetooth. I eventually unsubbed from Google music because of it. Whenever my phone would connect to my car, it would always try playing music through Apple Music and just be a giant hassle to get my music playing through Google. I feel like that's because I can't set certain apps to be the defaults, unlike Android.	dgforce	t1_dia6muy
t3_6edk2a	t1_diadu1y	1496263407	&gt; I feel like that's because I can't set certain apps to be the defaults, unlike Android.  Unless the app is open already, i've found any bluetooth function just won't work the way it's supposed to. I switch between pandora and spotify because ads and the skip button on my bluetooth device never works.	jackster1232002	t1_diadkvj
t3_6eespb	t1_diaeafu	1496263917	Really? Where did that piece of info come From?	snorbaard	t1_dia0xhk
t3_6edk2a	t1_diaexbu	1496264627	I just went back to keeping music on my phone instead of streaming it at all. It works, with having about 700 songs on my phone. At least things actually work doing it this way.	dgforce	t1_diadu1y
t3_6eh6t4	t1_diaeymc	1496264668	I ended up picking up the Saddle Brown or whatever the color is called leather case. I really like the feel and how it looks with the phone's white front. My first leather case and most expensive case I ever bought, but I think it'll be worth it!	PRbox	t1_diaas4g
t3_6edk2a	t1_diaf2mj	1496264798	I actually haven't had real music files on my phone for quite some time now.	jackster1232002	t1_diaexbu
t3_6eh6t4	t1_diafbua	1496265091	I love the one I got on my SE. Holds up super well.	XSSpants	t1_diaeymc
t3_6eespb	t1_diagenm	1496266332	Here is an [article](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/09/12/apples-iphone-6-iphone-6-plus-use-h265-codec-for-facetime-over-cellular) from around the time the iPhone 6 launched ([specs page in Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20141001022739/http://www.apple.com/iphone-6/specs/)).  I remember it being pretty big difference in data usage at the time, as my dad had a 5C which resulted in significantly more data on the history screen than when I called my mom's 6.  I know calling the (LTE) iPad Air 2 still used H.264, even though it was an A8X chip. don't know if they squared that way with the recent iPad Pros.  Of course, if the link speed is slow it could end up at around the same bitrate but better quality.	kurros	t1_diaeafu
t3_6eespb	t1_diahbwq	1496267409	Video.    Clearly not compressed using a middle o compression technique.	im_a_dr_not_	t1_di9st1u
t3_6edk2a	t1_diahpty	1496267868	Doesn't streaming music drain your mobile data? How many gigs have you got available for each month?	emptyheady	t1_dia0lbh
t3_6edk2a	t1_diaigir	1496268786	It's good but only because I make it. I have a 16GB SE and although I think buying 64GB at the time would be dumb because I'm planning on upgrading, if you got a 16GB phone you always have to keep an eye on it. The other day I was like shooting a great time lapse and the phone was out of space. I delete anything I don't use and I back up my photos to Google Photos so I have like 5GB free now but I'm so happy 32GB is the base thing now.	itsmegeorge	t3_6edk2a
t3_6edk2a	t1_diaim3f	1496268977	Apple Music has a setting that sets a limit of x GB and deletes songs that you haven't played in a while when it gets full.	40inmyfordfiesta	t3_6edk2a
t3_6ed3j5	t1_diaixy3	1496269397	lol at the downvotes. Like you lied! Those iPhone fanboys do the most	itsmegeorge	t1_di9gh2q
t3_6eh6t4	t1_diajb77	1496269860	I'm hoping it offers adequate protection. It's a little slippery so far that I'm hoping goes away as it wears in, but I love it so far.	PRbox	t1_diafbua
t3_6ed3j5	t1_diajcsi	1496269918	Can't say I didn't know it was coming! It's okay though I like apple products as much as the next guy	photosbywolf	t1_diaixy3
t3_6eh6t4	t1_diajcwo	1496269922	I have the saddle brown leather case on my 7+ and it's aging beautifully. My phone is black, and you do see some of that near the camera hole. I mostly didn't go for a red phone specifically because I wanted this color case (and I figured a black phone is easier to resell), and I'm not sure how the red/tan would go together.  But the feel and quality of the case are amazing. Buttons click well, and are metal too with a clean bevel.	minh0	t1_diaeymc
t3_6eh6t4	t1_diak0yf	1496270774	I've always gone for black or silver phones and cases so this was a big change for me. I actually really like it though. The red and the brown leather don't necessarily go together, but I think it looks good and so does the white front with the leather. I could try posting a picture later.  Yeah the case is great so far. I wasn't even sure if I got the right one at first because the box is so plain and doesn't even have the Apple logo on it. Anyway, the metal buttons are perfect and the feel is so premium. Has it protected your phone well?	PRbox	t1_diajcwo
t3_6eh6t4	t1_diakkop	1496271479	I went with white silicon for my red 7+	Nineand5	t3_6eh6t4
t3_6edk2a	t1_diakqok	1496271699	You download an app like amazon on your phone then delete it. Why not use a computer that has it there permanently? Do you just walk around and be like "time to buy this and that" then religiously buy things while mobile? That is weird lol. I like it.	iswirl	t3_6edk2a
t3_6eh6t4	t1_dial2sp	1496272139	I haven't dropped my phone yet, so honestly I can't speak to that. I'm pretty sure a silicone case would be better at absorbing shock - I mostly just love leather (the way it looks, feels, and ages), so I went for this case.  One complaint I do have is that dust kind of gathers between the lip of the case and the curve of the screen, but I imagine that's present on almost every case. It's wipe-able and I got used to it after a while.	minh0	t1_diak0yf
t3_6eh6t4	t1_dialo9n	1496272928	I had silicone case and bought and additional leather one but ended up returning the leather one since it felt so slippery compared to my silicone one.	juantalamera	t1_diajb77
t3_6eh6t4	t1_diamc1d	1496273796	Ah okay. Yes I love the feeling of it!	PRbox	t1_dial2sp
t3_6eh6t4	t1_diamnbk	1496274215	I might try a silicone someday but I'm liking the leather I got today.	PRbox	t1_dialo9n
t3_6edk2a	t1_diamti4	1496274446	I have a 6s 16gb. Had to upgrade my iCloud storage for pics, and have to be very selective about my apps. Most of my social media is kept on my iPad. I have to make sure to delete large message threads periodically as they can take up a lot of space. Overall, I don't enjoy using my phone as much because of this, but I've gotten used to it. Definitely planning on splurging in storage on the next iPhone release.	Xplorerslvr	t3_6edk2a
