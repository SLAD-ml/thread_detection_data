t3_4lyd8p	t1_d3r5smw	1464743358	This is a bad idea. The brain does not deal with interruptions or multitasking very well. To maximize brain power and productivity, keeping exercise separate from work time is important.  Recall your phone number backwards, now recall 7 letters of the alphabet backwards. Notice the time differentials. Now recall your phone number backwards interlaced with the first 7 letters of the alphabet. For example:  912 555 1212 (this should take you 3 seconds)  2121 555 219 (this will take you close to 12 seconds)  ABC DEF GHIJ (1 second)  9 A 1 B 2 C 5 D 5 E 5 F 1 G 2 H 1 I 2 J (this will take some people up to 30 seonds, using your phone number)  2 A 1 B 2 C 1 D 5 E 5 F 5 G 2 H 1 I 9 J (this will take some people up to a minute, using your phone number)  Minutes. It's exponential.	teambeemer	t3_4lyd8p

t3_4m13qd	t1_d3s0w3j	1464804639	the higher end product might be, but the lower end stuff sounds just like every other lower end product.   you can actually hear the difference in a better quality amp. It provides a fuller, richer sound. Why? Better components, better engineering. The low end stuff is meeting the barest definition of getting the job done. It's simply making stuff louder, not better.   There are a vast number of people on reddit who will tell you all solid state amps are the same and they're wrong. They will tell you that because their experience is with all that low end product. They will insist that it's an audiophile delusion that better product equates to better sound and I can assure you that at least to some extent that's not the case. You can definitely hear it.   I myself probably wouldn't spend a grand for an amp, but the $350 I did spend is markedly better than the $100ish low end. I figure something like this will last roughly a decade, so it's worth the relatively small difference in price.   Dacs too sound better as you scale upwards, but they require an astute engineer during conception to really bring them together.   As an example I have a music streamer II, music streamer II+, and I've had the music streamer HD.   All the dacs in the music streamer II price range sound roughly the same. The O2, the Schiit Modi, etc. Again they are accomplishing the bare minimum in regards to their intended purpose.  The II+ sounds somewhat better than the II, but it's not an 'OMG' moment kind of thing.   This would lead a lot of people who don't spend more than the $250 the II+ costs to believe that all dacs either sound the same or close.   Then you hear the costlier music streamer HD and it absolutely blows away those other dacs in every conceivable way. It gives off a full 360 degree so called 'holographic' sound and pulls out detail level in songs which is astounding. What you thought previously to be mummers in the background is actually speech you can understand, that kind of thing. You can hear the pluck of the string. You can hear someone inhale before they sing. It's just incredible. It sounds like *life*.   But that bar of entry is decidedly high for the average person, so the misconception that everything sounds like the lower end stuff sits and stews and colors commentary online.   For what it's worth I ended up sending my music streamer HD back because it sits at the very top of how much power a usb device should be pulling from a usb port, and mine had problems because of it. Apparently a small percentage of units produced did. That said I sit and think about the damn thing every day because the sound was so absolutely amazing it's hard to be happy with what I have. I'm going to reorder for my birthday in all likelihood.   So yeah, at least to a reasonable expenditure, it's well worth it.	pandabonanzas	t1_d3s0144

t3_4m13qd	t1_d3s1v5n	1464805883	no problem. be aware that listening to various dacs is harder to distinguish improvement than amps. This is because the things dacs are pulling out of songs don't jump out and hit you in the head, you really have to listen to stuff frequently to bear it out.   If you're a more casual listener you can get away with a lesser dac until you're willing to spend significantly more, but I would still get a good amp. That rich, full sound only comes from a good amp.   try the sennheiser hd600 if you get a chance. It has excellent tonality and exceptionally low distortion. It's just pleasing overall in most kinds of music.	pandabonanzas	t1_d3s1kny
t3_4m13qd	t1_d3s21zz	1464806126	Right. I'm probably leaning towards about $300 for a dac and maybe $500-600 for an amp. I'll definitely look out for those.	FigFrontflip	t1_d3s1v5n

t3_4m1pvf	t1_d3t7kbd	1464882564	&gt;I could buy a completely adequate, robust, and attractive watch every month for 30+ years...  Okay, but it wouldn't be made of the kinds of materials or with the same details as a 40k watch. I'm not saying every dime of that 40k goes to quality, the majority of it does not, but it will be a significantly nicer watch.  &gt;My lunch partners cannot see the internal construction of my watch.  Actually they can if you flip over [some of them](http://alang.watchprosite.com/img/watchprosite/alang/92/raw/alang_image.512292.jpg), others come with partially glass fronts to expose the internal mechanisms as well. Needless to say better materials also lends to it looking nicer in person, something other people who like watches will notice. Similar to cars or suits, those who know the industry/interest will spot the nice stuff and know why it's nice, that is a luxury people are willing to pay for to indulge.  &gt;nor does anyone care about the "historical pedigree" of a brand new watch  I didn't specifically mean the pedigree of the watch in my post, but many finely made german, swiss, and japanese made watches, due to their construction, last long enough to be passed down for a few generations. Part of the reason you might buy a new one is to be able to do exactly that and have a family heirloom. My family is german and we own a few Mont Blanc and Glashutte watches that were purchased in Hamburg, Germany before my dads side of the family came to the states. The watchmakers lived in the same place my ancestors did and drew from the same inspirations and culture, that's meaningful heritage for an heirloom, and it's not as if the watches were cheap back then either.  What my post meant by historical pedigree though was the history of the company itself, its track record for quality and the legacy of products it's produced, which for watches, can go back quite a ways, with very storied histories of quality craftsmanship. That's something people absolutely value, and not because of intangible reasons.	TheGuardianReflex	t1_d3t5hqt

Your only other option is a smartphone (Windows Phone or Android) with a 128GB microSD card. Windows Phone is generally preferred because the audio stack in Android is inferior.

I wonder how many sets like this they sell. Is it limited from the outset to a certain number? I wouldn't know if they sell 10,000 or 1,000,000. Do they just run as long as there is interest?	thebeavertrilogy	t1_d3u269d

Well if you have Android, you can get an open source app, but if you have Samsung then it's cool. 😎 so Samsung can just keep selling to Android users. And that's OK.	OptionalCookie	t1_d3ts24w

t3_4m9es6	t1_d3u7hje	1464939110	I have the original and the only reason I stopped using it was because the band broke and I haven't replaced it.   I loved how it had apps on google play for lots of different things. The music control was so handy. Using it as a camera remote was great. Reading texts, emails, even as a camera viewer was all right. It even had apps that let you reply to texts/emails but I didn't try those out since they were 3rd party and had bad reviews. The screen wasn't very accurate for typing text or numbers in a calculator or keyboard but the screen wasn't this big. It might be better to do that now. The waterproofing is great, it was rated by ifixit as like a 8 or 9 out of ten to fix yourself. I liked how I could lock the phone if my gear fit lost bluetooth, or lock apps with an app. Though I think that's available for any wearables on Android. The original did lag with 3rd party apps but that's something that was a dev problem, I think. It was "bring to your face" activated and I'm not sure if I liked needing to do that to activate it but it was so much more handy then pulling a big phone out all the time for anything. So I don't think they would remove it, I think In the video you can clearly see it activating while she moves it. This looks promising.   Though I only paid $50 for mine, it really opened my eyes to how handy smart watches and wearables are. If this one is faster and more accurate with 3rd party apps I might consider this over a pebble.  Edit some typos. Also loved having a flashlight on my wrist and the amazing wallpaper customization, though it had little 1st party support for watch faces or having date/steps/hr/cal burned added to those watch faces. And the 3rd party apps that let you change those faces wouldn't give access to date/steps/hr/calories burned. Also as a construction worker it still didn't have any scratches on the screen! The silver trim flaked and faded though. I was not easy on this device and it still looks good.   This was my first smart watch and it made me realize how intuitive touch screens are on them. But it also helped me realize how many smart watches never have a fully rounded spec list and it's getting so old. I have seen so many that someone should be able to make the full package by now. a waterproof smart watch that syncs to your phone, has 3rd party support, an accurate heart rate monitor and step counter/gps, touch, accurate flick wrist activation, accurate touch screen, full screen customization, 5 to 7 day battery life. It's been so long since I thought about it I can't remember because I've seen so many that always had 1 or 2 missing important features.	Ryesagain	t3_4m9es6

Their first phone was truly awesome.  But I haven't been too impressed with their next offerings, and they tend to build a LOT of hype and just don't come through.  They're not "bad" at all, but there's just nothing really special about them anymore, especially not worth taking a gamble with their latest marketing scheme.	BPwhowantstheD	t1_d3ug24z

Ok, pretty heavy claim. I wonder what the article goes on to talk about? Maybe Oneplus lied about their specs? Maybe they stole patents or obtained components unethically?   No, it seems the author of the article takes issue with this slogan for the Oneplus 2:  "2016 Flagship Killer"  Yeah, the entire article's beef is with that line.  &gt; No quick charging, no wireless charging, no NFC, a 1080p rather than 2K display, a still paltry 16GB of base storage, no SD card slot - all component choices that reek of compromise when OnePlus' high-end competitors are offering more.

t3_4loe37	t1_d3vq2ms	1465049680	Portable power bank for charging of phones, tablets, other gadgets? Most of them power you devices through a usb (Type A to be specific) port. Usb ports when working correctly should put out about 5v. You might be thinking of a power bank that has different different amps in which case you will find ~2.1a and ~1a. Most devices should be able to handle the 2.1a charging port, but check to make sure. Modern gadgets usually have over load protectors and such to prevent damage from too high of a current.   If I were to recommend one it would be this one by Anker link[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005X1Y7I2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_tfUuxb8N8M0R3] It should be able to provide your phone with about 1 full charge per day.

CDC Study: 1989 – 1997 An underwater welder’s life expectancy is not the same as your white-collar office worker. Last recorded, welder-divers die at a rate that is 40 times America’s national average. This diver average death rate was researched from the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s article (OSHA’s study) from 1989 – 1997. I go into more detail on this study in this article, but here’s the breakdown:  &gt;The corresponding annual death rate of 5 out of approximately 3,000 full-time underwater welders. It touted drowning as the number one cause of death.  &gt;Large studies on underwater welders’ life expectancy is still limited due to the small population size in this field. About 5,500 – 7,500 divers work in the United States during any given moment. This number drops during the “offseason” offshore. Let’s look current fatality rates using current occupation population:  &gt;6,500 (average US underwater welder population)  &gt;6,500 / 3,000 =  2.17  &gt;2.17 X 5 = 11  &gt;Based on old fatality rates and new population statistics, approximately 11 welder-divers die every year.  &gt;In addition, underwater welding and commercial diving are listed as a “non-hazardous” profession in the eyes of the government. Their labeling gives little to no incentive for increased regulations and enforcement of those regulations. (if you’re part of a diving union, that’s another matter).  http://waterwelders.com/underwater-welder-life-expectancy/	Hitchens_	t1_d3vtvvd

Most companies are cheap. I work in very bad visibility water sometimes where you can't even see your hand in front of you cleaning 35' trash racks at a nuclear power site, I also clean all Navy vessels on the east coast. As cool as this sounds I don't see going far out of the Navy or even far in the Navy for that matter. Navy divers I've worked around have not impressed me much with the gear they use.

I definitely do not want to convince you to mess around with unlocking the bootloader and flashing, if you are not comfortable with that - which is fine, the phone should work without that.   That said, I think the official OTA update should not cause any problems, so if you want to try a newer Android version, I would give that a shot before trying out custom ROMs.	Steppdeckenwolf	t1_d3x3rbe

It's hard to know if the screen going out was related to rooting but it got progressively worse and I can't do anything on it at all now.

If the earbuds have internal storage, why do they need to link to an Android phone? I would rather see smaller earbuds at the cost of some other features like onboard memory, especially if they still have to link to a smartphone.	Fridge307	t1_d3zd7o9
t3_4mxip1	t1_d3zh1wb	1465310109	i think its about 25% more mAh. Not entirely sure how that translates to actual screen time but id assume about 20% more	beegreen	t1_d3z9jza
t3_4mysp6	t1_d3zi6jp	1465311719	Sigh, I need more micro-usb chargers in my home.	Useless_Advice_Guy	t3_4mysp6
t3_4mysp6	t1_d3zj7hg	1465313114	I would like to have earbuds that connect without wires to a 3,5mm jack. I don't need 4gb storage or any more interfaces. Use the tiny space the 4gb storage takes for more battery. Ideally they would run off self-mined earwax.	Recklesslettuce	t3_4mysp6
t3_4mysp6	t1_d3zjxc6	1465314070	Yeah, these Samsung wireless earbuds are extremely similar to the Bragi Dash--the 4GB internal storage, the "fitness tracker" stuff it is trying with heart rate monitoring, hell even the design looks pretty similar. I've never used the Bragi Dash but the early problems with these completely wireless earbuds seem to be crappy wifi connectivity to the phone and pretty low battery life (Dash is ~3 hours; I think I read the Samsungs will be slightly less).	yodersphinx	t1_d3zi0rp

t3_4mysp6	t1_d3zm5c5	1465316975	I'd take lower battery life in return for no connection dropouts, i'm looking at truly wireless earbuds for the gym so dont need long playtime	PrettySlickShit	t1_d3zjxc6
t3_4mysp6	t1_d3zmkzc	1465317553	Just an example of one feature I would drop for smaller size. I'd also drop fitness tracking and phone stuff bc who talks on the phone while running? I want straight headphones, 1-2 hour battery life, and as small as possible.	Fridge307	t1_d3zgeyd
t3_4mysp6	t1_d3zmmvv	1465317622	Why? If it's leashed to a phone via Bluetooth anyway, why bother?  (Not that I expect you to know, just griping)	Fridge307	t1_d3zi0rp
t3_4mysp6	t1_d3zphl3	1465321293	Looks like they don't have to be linked to an android phone.  The memory is to listen to music while it's not connected to a phone.	TheAmenMelon	t1_d3zexy3
t3_4mxl2u	t1_d3zqdkz	1465322426	Any news on when that lineup is supposed to be released?	ace425	t1_d3zl4fk

t3_4mxip1	t1_d3zus63	1465328037	It's 33% higher from the S7, which had 3000 mAh.	daugan	t1_d3zh1wb
t3_4mysp6	t1_d3zzzsz	1465334770	No, the 4GB internal storage works as an mp3 player *within* the earbuds, you can leave your phone at home and still play music. All the play/pause, volume up/down controls are on the earbuds themselves, its all controlled by swiping/tapping	PrettySlickShit	t1_d3zmmvv
t3_4m6lgy	t1_d400640	1465335009	Oh I see. I wasn't thinking about extra information. In that case I'd be inclined to agree with you. However, we won't know until we get our hands on them I guess.	sidogz	t1_d3ulklf
t3_4mysp6	t1_d4075fv	1465345273	It looks like Samsung bought the designs off of Bragi. Common occurrence in a startup product. Personally, I won't be getting the dash/Samsung buds until everything works better including the interface.	TURBO2529	t1_d3zjxc6
t3_4mysp6	t1_d407abj	1465345479	Shoot, even take the touch interface out. Currently they turn on when you put them in your ears, just keep that and have them pause when you take them out. Other than that, it just needs to play music and be really small. I do think they were trying to do too much with the Dash and I think Samsung will change some things in later generations.  Edit: well, these look nice! https://www.getkanoa.com/	TURBO2529	t1_d3zmkzc
t3_4mxip1	t1_d407n3w	1465346015	My really rough guess is 45 hour claimed time. This will translate to 9-10 hours of pure movie playing with screen on.	TURBO2529	t1_d3z9jza
t3_4mxip1	t1_d408dsf	1465347106	Thats much better than what i have now, unfortunately I just learned its an ATT exclusive and i have verizon so ill have to look up alternatives.	TK503	t1_d407n3w

t3_4mxl2u	t1_d40ln1o	1465370594	Titan X is/was over $1000. You can beat it now with a 1070 at around $400.	Fragasm	t1_d40js2n

t3_4mm045	t1_d416vu3	1465409466	Honestly Cortana sounds terrific, but not as long as it's powered by Bing. Every time I've tried searching for local businesses with it I never get any relevant results.	Rdge	t3_4mm045

t3_4mysp6	t1_d41oey0	1465432918	I think you'll like the new Bose SoundSport Pulse Wireless.    I prefer Samsung's since I don't like to carry my phone (or other mp3 players) while I jog. This is perfect.	KingRedBunny	t1_d3zj7hg

t3_4loba7	t1_d427av8	1465476409	Does anyone know or has anyone found any text regarding having both the docking station / external Asus graphics plugged in at the same time. There is only one USB-C on it, but the docking station also has a USB-C on it as well. Can you run both at the same time?	p3t3or	t3_4loba7
t3_4loba7	t1_d427cmw	1465476506	New phones are being sold with 4GB of RAM.	p3t3or	t1_d3p9ggr
t3_4n9kko	t1_d428xvz	1465479341	That's really cool. Big expensive hardware synths like Moogs can be way too expensive and software synths can be way too complicated for kids at first. This helps them understand basic principles of synthesis easily.	jjossie	t3_4n9kko
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42b5a1	1465482661	Neat. It's like a large version of a pocket operator for kids.	synthboomboom	t3_4n9kko
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42cfrg	1465484442	Love the push on collaboration for a "toy" synth. That price point is a little prohibitive though.	Jkountz	t3_4n9kko

t3_4n9kko	t1_d42ecoq	1465486940	Looks fun,  but also might be doable on a 99c app on any tablet.	Dr_Zeuss	t3_4n9kko
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42ek5b	1465487209	Hardware store synths Sound better, and analog controls are more immersive for kids, cool!	DarthSancho	t3_4n9kko
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42fwtg	1465488960	None of the 5 times they say Data Duo in the article is it linked on Anchor text that makes sense. Instead, it's at the bottom as "source" and the raw URL...	footinmymouth	t1_d42fswp
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42if5x	1465492167	For 330 bucks you can get a real fucking synth off eBay /craigslist and still have money to get your kid a Lego or something appropriate like that. This would be perfect for less than 100. Who here has spent that much on your child in the last 12 months that wasn't for something absolutely essential? Mhm.	Ok0420	t3_4n9kko
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42jquk	1465493856	Next my kid will ask me for a fake beard and vintage framed glasses.	teious	t3_4n9kko
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42jx6l	1465494080	anyone know of a similar product like this but less than $100?	lawsof3	t3_4n9kko
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42kl1i	1465494897	Yeah, price point is an issue. Needs to be 100-150ish.	Whylus	t3_4n9kko
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42klgv	1465494911	Not really, but close. Your best bet would be a cheap midi controller, and a soft synth. TAL software makes cool free plugins (assuming you have a DAW and a computer).	kyleksq	t1_d42jx6l
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42krcx	1465495120	$350 for a single oscillator synth. Yeah right.	kyleksq	t3_4n9kko
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42ll0x	1465496180	For the people balking at the price: to build something with similar features in Eurorack it would easily run 2x this cost.  Sequencer, 2x oscilators, clock source/lfo, filter, ADSR. You're talking about 100-200 dollars for each of those components.  A hardwired synth would be cheaper than that though. The newish Korg Minilogueis only 200 dollars more with a whole ton of extra features and 3 more voices.  Here you're paying for: form factor, ease of use, and the fact that these guys probably can't secure huge production runs to lower the costs.	TTUporter	t3_4n9kko
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42morh	1465497561	Considering you can purchase a DAW such as Reason for the same price, yeah, a bit steep imo...	gtmattz	t1_d42krcx
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42no53	1465498789	Let's see.  Monthly piano lessons $100.  Swim lessons $100 and Gymnastics $80.  This is monthly.  While not absolutely necessary I feel they are conducive to growth and learning mentally and physically.	Snabu	t1_d42if5x
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42ntio	1465498985	If it'll stop my daughter from drooling over my keyboards, sure.  I'll start saving now.	Naaaadroj	t3_4n9kko
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42q0hc	1465501795	I would recommend something like a Roland sh-201 (around 350 on eBay).  It has all knobs/controls clearly labeled with diagrams  and is fairly simple to play with and hear what everything does, but has the advantage that it is a real synth with some depth they won't outgrow quickly.	ittleoff	t3_4n9kko

t3_4n9kko	t1_d42rrae	1465504066	Not all of us are that fortunate. I'm a single parent. 25 years old. No college education. I do what I can, when I can. A 300 dollar toy that is less functional than an actual synth is a stupid idea. Just agree.	Ok0420	t1_d42no53

t3_4n9kko	t1_d42tp6y	1465506672	Korg Monotron is $50. You can get two of them for $100 (there is a Duo that has two oscillators and a Delay that has one oscillator and a delay), and you can connect them together. And, they are true analog, not simulated. For how much this thing costs you could get an MS-20.	senatorpjt	t1_d42jx6l
t3_4n9kko	t1_d42tpii	1465506684	I think this is more for the parent than the kid... the parent gets to play with the synth and the kid gets to participate (which they're going to do anyways if they see you playing a synth) but on this synth the controls have been limited enough so the kid can't screw it up. So, the parent still gets to have fun without getting aggravated that the kid is messing with their synth, pardon the pun but it makes it more of an additive experience than subtractive.  source: I have young kids and synths	bonestamp	t1_d42if5x
t3_4ncoji	t1_d42tx8o	1465506982	I need this for my wife for when she goes to the store to spend $20 and somehow it shows as $100 on the bank statement.	Tivia	t3_4ncoji
t3_4ncoji	t1_d42txnn	1465506999	this has /r/hailcorporate written all over it. I visited their website ONCE because I saw them on Shark Tank and I've seen nothing but their ads everywhere since then. They are clearly spending a LOT of money on internet advertising. I would be surprised if this isn't some corporate shill.  I just looked at the username " we_love_wearable_tech"  yea....  just look at their history. It's just pushing this product over and over. This user needs to be banned and so does their IP.	gujupike	t3_4ncoji
t3_4ncoji	t1_d42u59y	1465507292	I have one of these if anyone has any questions about it. A couple of FAQs...  1. It does work to ~~curve~~ curb behavior if you use it correctly 2. It's very poorly designed. It uses a cheap rubber bracelet that feels weird and uncomfortable and feels like it will fall apart any minute. I paid something like $200 for mine and I can't believe how shitty it is. $30 Timex watches have better engineering on their rubber straps. 3. The marketing crap is ANNOYING. They email you constantly with clickbait subject lines, surveys, etc.  4. It comes with an app that you use for guided meditation, but the guy who did the recording is 1) very, abundantly, obviously not trained in voiceover work and 2) was apparently just recording this in his home office or something? There is all sorts of background noise that takes you right out of the moment for the purpose of meditation. He couldn't have at least gone to a recording studio and done this in an iso booth? Yeesh. 5. My issue had nothing to do with compulsive shopping or whatever, but you can use this as a negative punishment (operative conditioning) for just about anything you want to fix, from overeating to smoking to a dozen other things. My issue is completely socially debilitating and I would have paid a lot more than $200 to resolve it. As I said, it *does* work if you use it. I just wish it were designed better, and also the price seems exorbitant.	DanielleMuscato	t3_4ncoji

Unless there is some sort of patent in place in for a competent algorithm for judging actions then no company, be it Google or Apple would be interested in acquisition. I highly doubt there is much substance, since I'm guessing it passed a freedom to operate study. Just chinese made trash that some bros threw together in hopes of playing entrepreneur.

t3_4nckri	t1_d439xwj	1465533289	I have one of those Lenovo Yoga laptops. The hard drive died year into ownership, after I installed an update in windows 8.1. That was the last month I was covered under warranty, so I called to get it sent back. They were obviously Indian or Pakistani or something, but they did fine helping me out with all the troubleshooting before concluding that the hard drive was bad. They sent me  a shipping label and I was all ready to send the computer back.   Then I had a death in the family  I knew I only had 30 days before they closed the ticket, but I was in a pretty bad place so I never made it to the post office. 1 year later I was cleaning out my apartment and I found the box with the laptop. I called Lenovo and told them the honest truth, and they agreed to fix my laptop even after a year had passed.   It took about 7 days for them to replace my hard drive and now the computer works fine. People probably have bad experiences with Lenovo, but I didn't.	StopPissingOnMyFace	t1_d4375yh

t3_4n9kko	t1_d43pt84	1465571984	I think that's why there's so many comments about cost here, these guys commenting sound like they don't really understand that hardware synths have gone way up in price now that everything is digital. If you want something to be right in front of you without needing a USB to get it to work, you gotta pay. It's been that way for a while now but then again I'm not on the hobby end.	Crimz609	t1_d43on1q
t3_4n9kko	t1_d43r536	1465573806	Actually, going digital has drastically reduced costs for hardware synths. Analog synthesizers needed a lot more engineering. Something as simple as a shortage of a particular resister could stop production and could even require a hardware revision. Now, for most digital hardware synths, the cost is in designing the interface and coding the software. All the hardware is off-the-shelf, with a few exceptions (mod wheels and piano keys generally).

I can (1) follow you around and call you out for being a shill and (2) report your account.  I've already done the second and will do the first until I get bored and move on to something else.   You should know - I'm a sales guy myself. I'm all about making the sale and getting the close. I pretty much have boiler room memorized and worked at place that played Boiler Room and Wall Street on the wall TV's 24-7 but the reality is you are bad at it.  You are not a good salesperson. A good salesperson follows four  steps (1) build rapport (2) ask probing questions (3) fill the need/build value (4) close.  You are jumping straight into building value without doing the first three and that makes you come off as a BAD sales person.   You are no better than the person in the mall yelling at me to buy a cell phone.  That is poor poor technique. Never talk about your product first.  Patience is as important of a characteristic in a good salesperson as anything else.   Visit /r/sales and learn something.	gujupike	t1_d43ts05
t3_4nckri	t1_d43wlsd	1465581066	Yeah, maybe.  I'm probably going to do the same with mine, I used to dual boot until recently, and the Windows 10 update broke something so Windows doesn't work anyways.	Assorted_Jellymemes	t1_d43swnk
t3_4mcn73	t1_d4461hj	1465593935	I agree with your statements. However, as someone who followed the company, their second phone had less features than their first, for more money. That generally made people upset with oneplus.	kollabane	t1_d3ve2fd
t3_4nckri	t1_d446831	1465594213	I didn't have any issues with their tech support when my refurbished Yoga failed.  What I did have a problem with was their refurbishment program, or what I assume was a lack of.  The damn thing had a faulty battery right out of the box that wouldn't charge.  How does a product that doesn't charge get through the refurb process, especially when it was probably a faulty battery in the first place that resulted in the returned product.  I don't have much trust in their products after that experience.	iushciuweiush	t1_d4375yh

t3_4nkbj6	t1_d44u0me	1465650887	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe10ExwzCqk  Basically, based off parallel tracking and mapping tech that's been around computer vision research for a while now - camera is able to recognize localized points as a camera pans and moves and then tracks those localized points in relation to each other to determine the 3D form of the space its mapping.  Tango is the evolution of that - using depth/IR camera and better motion tracking sensors to provide better fusion of information so that the system can map faster, more accurately across a wider range of objects.  It's still not quite good enough for VR use (with next to 0ms latency requirements)... but it is more than good enough for letting people easily create 3D meshes of their surroundings and environments, and even objects.  It's like photogrammetry on steroids. Once this is built into all android devices going forwards (not sure when, but eventually), then all those devices will have a hyper competent system for mapping out 3D environments, which will help with various projects for Google... including their self driving cars... and by creating a 3D mirror world that users can visit in VR... imagine been able to visit other cities without having to fly there, or even scrub back and forth through time to when these devices first become popular, seeing how cities change as well as major events of the past (currently our future, but past from the perspective of that future point of time).

t3_4nkcsc	t1_d45i6p5	1465693946	It doesn't bother me. I prefer that to dealing with touch controls on such a small screen. I also prefer the Pebble because it feels more durable. That along with the price makes me far less concerned about breaking it. If I had $500 on my wrist, I would probably be nervous constantly.  Really, though, it is all about what you want. I don't need my watch to do a ton. The Android watches and Apple Watch do more. The experience is richer. For something that just gives you a little more convenience and operates as a watch, Pebble is great.	MattAU05	t1_d45hm8z

t3_4nperv	t1_d46r79p	1465782371	There are some minor conveniences. When I run to the gym my phone is in my bag so I can change sonds without needing to get my phone out. Sleep tracking, pedometer, few fitness reminders (e.g. sitting at my desk too ling, get up and walk, drink water etc.). All of these things can be on my phone but having notifications on my wrist means my phones battery lasts 2 days.

t3_4nuigv	t1_d473viz	1465809524	Samsung Galaxy S3 mixes songs together, why?  Hi everyone, I bought a Samsung 64GB SD card to use in my Galaxy S3 so I can put my music on there.  After I copied my album on the SD card, whenever I play a song, there would be another song randomly playing for within the original track for 5-10 seconds.  For example, If I play a 2Pac song, at some point a Jay Z song will play for a bit then it would go back to the 2Pac song. Even if I delete the Jay Z song and readd the 2Pac song, it will still do the same thing.  I tried formating the SD card, i tried loads of music player apps, I tried adding the songs to SD card by Dropbox and I tried downloading the songs directly to SD card all ending in the same results.  If I add the same songs to internal storage, it would play fine, its only when I play from SD card.  If anyone can help me I will be very grateful thank you.	Supacat15	t3_4nuigv

Also installed on the laptop was a piece of software (called WriteIt or something) which would allow you to write on screen and it would convert it to text. (handwriting to text).

You can get good FPS on mid-low tier games, but the top end games at the highest resolutions will not run anything close to 60FPS (which, as misguided as that number is, is what people use to judge "reliable").  Keep in mind that the current XB1 can't even run 1080 properly without the graphics needing to be downgraded in the software itself.  That said, of course M$ will sell it at 4k capable and then just handicap the games, meaning it's still pointless to play anything on a console that can be played on a PC.	Dhrakyn	t1_d47xbpx

I've seen older Thinkpads be recommended but want to find a trustworthy source for them, as I've been reading warnings about locked down BIOSes and such.

I bought a few "Flagship" android phones that are practically worthless two years later because the manufacturer/carier don't give a shit.

Low resolution upscaled to a higher, tag on some motion blur and its "next-gen". Yea 4k is a boost for consoles, but if I put a dollar on how many Xbone and PS4 users understand "6Tf" means other than it being a number that is probably higher than the current gen of console. High numbers doesn't mean performance, and neither does the tests you see online with baselines about the cards. Once aftermarkets drop, maybe we'll see better numbers. But right now 1080 is new, not tested heavily, and the xbone release is a year away before we get any answers.	Jared364	t1_d484930

If I delete the 2Pac album then re add it, it would affect the same songs but interupts it with a different Jay Z song.  Android version 4.3. There is no sim card in the phone and its unlocked.

t3_4nwwgw	t1_d48lpmt	1465903761	30fps is unbearable and is a shitty performance mark to aim for. Most AAA console games are going to run at or below 20fps in 4K. Just like how FO4 runs on PS4.      If a single $600+ card can't do it then how is an integrated processor going to?	DemonEyesKyo	t1_d48ixem

t3_4nwwgw	t1_d48nd46	1465907647	They also said "60FPS, 4k Gaming." Now doesn't mean that those two terms are combined or take place at the same time. But the way the conference went, they followed the two terms, not separately. This will probably show up in a reaction video when an argument such as this arises in the future. Some will post that link you'll see that it was one sentence. "Confirmed" plus they said the same thing about this console, 60 FPS and high fidelity. Its mostly 30 FPS 1080p at best with mid range fidelity, up-scaling, and lots of motion blur and other additives. Not saying you're not mentioning that or "PCMR or get out". Just saying you are supposed to get 60 now... Everyone cracks on Ubi and other AAA dev's for selling short the games they show, what about M$ and the console they promise not living up to potential?

t3_4nxu24	t1_d48pbs3	1465911251	For some people, 200 dollars is actually less valuable than two hours of their free time.  People have different needs and thus buy different products. I build my own computer, but it's natural that some people prefer prebuilds instead.	kushangaza	t1_d48o8w9
t3_4o02a8	t1_d48ph9x	1465911505	Is the Scorpio  ment to be the next gen?   It doesnt really seem like it. I mean if the S if the 1.5 is the Scorpio the 2.0?  All they are doing is really making a high end verson of the One for 4k and VR.	mcwilg	t1_d48g9qe
t3_4nxu24	t1_d48pusw	1465912099	It's much more than 2 hours to source parts, assemble them, and set it up and you know it. I did it and still do. So don't BS me. Also it may surprise you but a lot of people make way more than 100 dollars an hour. And even more people value their free time way higher than that.

t3_4o02a8	t1_d48str0	1465916338	Yeah I came to the same conclusion. 5/6 times.   Im genuinely excited however even if I stuck aside £30 a month I dont think I will even be close to affording it come release day. Saying that, I'm more than happy to wait and see how it plays out after release.   No point forking out goodness knows how much and then having to buy accessories like a VR headset for even more :-(  Besides if its a "gap filler" until the next gen, then Im more than happy to wait.	mcwilg	t1_d48sg7k
t3_4nwwgw	t1_d48sylp	1465916517	Oh I know you're supposed to but that promise is rarely delivered.  I don't at all expect that they can achieve 4k 60 fps with a simple console.	chaoswreaker	t1_d48nd46

t3_4o02a8	t1_d48v959	1465919473	Scorpio isn't going to be a gap filler. I believe their new strategy will be to make the consoles more and more PC like, where they can release "upgrade" consoles that are backward compatible to keep up with big game changers like VR. I'm sure in another 4 years after the Scorpio there will be another upgrade to support 4k per eye 120hz VR.	Akkuma	t1_d48str0

t3_4nxu24	t1_d48zccf	1465924469	That's 2 hours of assembly. Take the time to figure out what you want, find deals, wait for delivery, put together parts, and then you are responsible for any problems, not to mention that support is not an option.  Sure you can spend hours looking through the website, wait for your tower to show up, plug it in, then have a fancy phone number in case of problems.  $200 is cheap if it's going to save me that kind of hassle, and give me support.

I guess we'll have to see the price and more features. If scorpio undercuts PCs by a lot maybe, but it seems like it'll end up as a bad investment because the people who care about power are just going to go "oh all of these games are on my PC anyway." Which is smart if they're eventually just going to go "Xbox is now basically a brand of PC gaming" but if that's the case why announce a new console?	YesThisIsDrake	t1_d494k6v

The problem presented in the forum seems to be cause by having multiple folders containing music on their SD card.  Try creating a folder on the root of your SD card called "My Music" and moving all of your music into their. It seems like you music is in album folders, so try moving the folder first into the new folder. If that does not work, move the music files into the new folder (ie from /My Music/Album/Song.mp3 to /My Music/Song.mp3)  Edit Forgot link:  http://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s3/214895-playing-song-sd-card-2.html	maglax	t1_d48l0al

t3_4nuigv	t1_d49bqy3	1465938853	While there are portable printers that directly attach to camera, it's a brand-specific thing. What you will find is portable printers that will accept an SD card, [like this Canon](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Selphy-CP1200-Wireless-Printer/dp/B0195JC9D2). The problem you will run into is that the format/filesystem the camera likes probably won't be what the printer likes, so you can't just pop the SD card from the camera to the printer and print photos.   You might be able to get this to work if you save all of your photos into as low-resolution JPEGs as possible.	rtechie1	t1_d4944al
t3_4nuigv	t1_d49bw8i	1465939050	Thanks for the reply. The description says that I can print directly from my camera or by USB - is that as you said, brand specific? Or could I connect my sony camera to it via USB and print to get around the low-resolution thing.	MissingPairOfUggs	t1_d49bqy3
t3_4nuigv	t1_d49c4g8	1465939350	MP3 players are a dying category and there is less available each year.   If you want something with 32GB of storage or less, the [Sansa Clip Jam](http://www.amazon.com/Sandisk-8GB-Clip-Player-Black/dp/B00VXMY262). Supports FLAC. The Sansa Clip series has been popular for a long time and has seen little change. This is like an MP3 player from 2003.  But if you want a *nice* MP3 player, [Fiio](http://fiio.net/en/fiio) is pretty much the only game in town anymore. The Fiio X1 supports SD cards up to 2TB and is $100. If you're willing to spend more, the X5 supports 2 SD cards (up to 512GB with the new 256GB SD cards. Which cost $250 USD).   Your only other option is a smartphone (Windows Phone or Android) with a microSD card. Windows Phone is generally preferred because the audio stack in Android is inferior. I'd look at the [Nokia 640](http://www.amazon.com/AT-Go-Phone-Microsoft-Contract/dp/B012YLRXB6).	rtechie1	t1_d48hs7o
t3_4nuigv	t1_d49cgd0	1465939785	Dell and Lenovo are the only vendors that make laptops with pointing sticks. With Dell you have the [Inspiron 15"](http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/latitude-e5570-laptop/pd/) and with Lenovo you have a lot more choices, basically the whole [Thinkpad](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/) line has trackpoints. I'd look at the Thinkpad X series.	rtechie1	t1_d47z6pa
t3_4nwwgw	t1_d49gim6	1465945528	Also, keep in mind, Microsoft is not going to start shopping on amazon/newegg to buy individual hardware parts for their console. It's ridiculous to compare what we pay (as regular consumers) when we buy GPUs and CPUs for our custom gaming PC to what Microsoft will end up paying when they make an order for a couple hundreds of thousands or millions of mass produced custom CPUs/GPUs. The fact that you had to pay $1000 to build your custom gaming machine that struggle with 4K is not representative of what Microsoft can achieve with the same price point.	shmed	t1_d480fjn
t3_4nuigv	t1_d49gpq8	1465945825	I can't find much detail about this but I would guess, and this is only a guess, that it will work with camera that support USB Mass Storage mode. Basically, when you plug the camera into a computer via USB, does it show up as a "Removable Drive"? If so, it will probably work.   I mentioned the format because the printer probably doesn't support RAW format. Don't worry about the photo resolution, this printer like all portable photo printers, has are really low resolution, 300x300.	rtechie1	t1_d49bw8i
t3_4o02a8	t1_d49gtd4	1465945977	Looks like the old definition of next gen for consoles is dead. Theyre trying to shift to small upgrades over small period of time. The justification is that consumers have no issue doing it with smartphones and PC's but honestly a huge selling point of Consoles was not having to worry about dropping cash on a new system for another few years. So its going to be interesting how it all turns out.	wakawaka86	t1_d48ph9x

t3_4o02a8	t1_d49h3xh	1465946420	It's honestly the only advantage of having a console.

t3_4nwwgw	t1_d4bbveh	1466063431	Likely the system will run at or near to 60 fps, however it won't be real 4k. More likely to be upscaled otherwise this box won't be affordable for the average console user.

You also buy an antivirus program if you're still cautious, although it's not very likely to get a virus.

If you want a basic phone with good specs and up to date, the Nexus is right for you. If you want special features like the automatic credit card payment and built TV remote, go with the Samsung S7. But my favorite right now is the Motorola, you can get a custom back for it so u can turn your phone into a speaker or a projector.  I don't think any of these phones will let you down.  As for music, Google will let you upload up to 50000 songs in the cloud for free. You have to download their music uploader on your computer, and use the play music app on your phone.  All these phones are great and have good specs and good cameras, and aren't as limited for customization as the iPhone is.	tmogo	t1_d4bmzzi

Even if by then you can buy VR PC for $1000, MS has economics of scale and the fact they make $$$ on every game sold.  Think of the Xbox 360. Before it launched, its dev kit was a $1500 Macintosh G5.

t3_4nuigv	t1_d4c8ag8	1466115104	On the main screen you should see two large buttons, top one is your device and the bottom the SD. Click your device storage and locate the music folder. Long press the icon until  the options in the top bar change. Click the three dots icon and scroll down the list until you see Move To. Select it and on the next window locate the back arrow in the top left. Click it until you find the list containing extfileSD or some such.

t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4cw9s3	1466163572	It has an external box that the vr headset connects to, which that external box connects to the PS4. You gotta keep in mind that the games that are going to be VR, are not going to have extreme textures like Crysis 3. Then you might be asking then how do they get 90fps/120fps for the headset? Well technically it's still 60fps, but that external box interpolates new frames between the current frames and trys to "Guess" what that frame will be. Some new TV uses this to get that "120hz". One last thing to keep in mind, the panel resolution in the headset is not big. The resolution is 1920x1080(1080p), which is basically 960x1080 per each eye. Compare that to the Oculus Rift which is 2160x1200, which is 1080x1200 per each eye. I hope this solves your confusion.   Edit: Forgot to add this in just in case some misinterprets. No, the external box does not have a gpu in it. It's probably(most likely) a processing chip that handles the interpolation.   Edit#2: Promise last edit lol. If  you wonder how the PS4 tracks the headset, the headset has five blue lights on the front of it. With that, the PS4 camera can track those pinpoints in real time. It's basically using the same concept as the Playstation Move Controllers. *Which, in the demos I've seen, use them with the VR headset"	KrazieMonky	t1_d4cvc3l
t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4cwknz	1466164352	Yeah, and the new Xbox is better than an N64.  Just being better than something else does not mean it's good enough for an entirely unrelated thing.	alexxerth	t1_d4cw2do

t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4cxvj5	1466167266	You may have missed my edit, that also explains it. The PS4 VR runs in a 1920 x 1080 resolutions. That's not going to be really great...	Gummybear_Qc	t1_d4cxtpk

t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4cxzmx	1466167497	Yes but the point of having VR imo is so we can enjoy full fledged games in VR. Look at fallout 4, it's coming out in VR in 2017, that's going to be fucking amazing!	Gummybear_Qc	t1_d4cxqzi

t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4cy9ao	1466168015	Man the graphics must be terrible if a PS4 is supposed to output 60 fps at 1920x1080. Even acceptable-looking games are only 30 fps currently.	Nope_______	t1_d4cw9s3
t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4cynq1	1466168771	It still has the potential to be fun but will be a decent down grade from Rift/Vive which are already a compromise in resolution to have a product that wasn't dead out of the gate.

t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4cyx3v	1466169239	Versus 1080 x 1200 per eye?  Sure more resolution is always better but that is the res that DK2 used and I didn't hear anyone say "wow look how much better the resolution is in CV1!".  If we were comparing 4K then it would be worlds apart (let's hope for CV2).  I'm mainly curious how the display looks and whether they solved the edge focus and distortion problem that Rift and Vive have.	ChrisSlicks	t1_d4cuykw
t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4cyy2c	1466169287	Yeah, I keep saying and thinking this.   Game devs are going to have to use some new tricks to maintain that kind of FPS.  Like using simple shaders and no-textures.   Limit the view distance so the console does not have to render as much, etc.   Also, there are some games where there are TWO views.  One for the VR person and one for people using a normal controller to interact with vr player in the game, thus having to render TWO views not just one	Liongoroar	t1_d4cy9ao
t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4cyy9w	1466169297	Basically it has worse resolution screens than the PC headsets, and games will be rendered according to the power of the PS4. But they are making up for it by having an external processor that makes sure every game is running at 120hz. This makes it the smoothest first wave headset, with the lowest quality image. Many reviewers have said it's the one with the least feeling of motion sickness when you start using it.   Tbh, I did doubt that the PS4 would be capable of still running games that looked nice, but after seeing Farpoint shown at their E3 conference, as well as a few others, I'm sold.   Edit: Not Farscape	shaxamo	t1_d4cuykw
t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4cz1c9	1466169450	Some games will have two player or more, one person in VR the other using the tv for normal interaction.	Liongoroar	t1_d4cxdit

t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4cz4it	1466169611	Well, I heard if you focus on the pixels in a HTC vive you can see them, and that's 2160 x 1200, 1080 x 1200 per eye, so imagine on a PS4 VR or the Rift DK2, that's why I didn't like the Rift DK2, as someone pointed out in another comment.	Gummybear_Qc	t1_d4cyw4f
t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4czaib	1466169901	Sounds like it would take at least a 4k display per eye on OLED to be near flawless.	TheBigby	t1_d4cz4it
t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4czc8v	1466169989	The Vive and the Rift CV1 have the same resolution.	ChrisSlicks	t1_d4cz2ps
t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4czrrz	1466170713	No idea about the CV1 but the Vive is  2 160 × 1 200 px 1 200 × 1 080 each eye	Gummybear_Qc	t1_d4czc8v
t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4czs95	1466170734	Yeah, the vive is just ok, not great. So I really can't imagine anything lower.	Gummybear_Qc	t1_d4czaib
t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4d02qd	1466171209	Correct.  As I said the consumer Rift (CV1) is the same.  The lack of resolution is still very noticeable (only 25% more than DK2) but generally speaking it doesn't really detract from the experience.	ChrisSlicks	t1_d4czrrz
t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4d0635	1466171357	The PSVR has been out in the wild for a while now, has been trialed extensively with loads of titles, and if was going to be really poor, we would have heard of it already. The 'PC master race' idiots are bound to shit all over it, without ever having tried it. For $400, I think it's way better value then the others.	PokeHerForMe	t1_d4cxky3

t3_4ohsnj	t1_d4d0wmt	1466172500	Well the whole purpose of the interpolation is because to reduce motion sickness. Oculus and HTC Vive both concluded that, to get rid of motion sickness, the fps needs to say at a constant 90fps or higher. If it dips below 90fps, people start to get motion sickness. And I don't think there is going to be significant lag because the PS4 is not handling the interpolation(which I might add, does take a lot of processing power), the external box is doing that.

t3_4nuigv	t1_d4dd6w2	1466188489	I have a question on Micro USB cables and their charging abilities!  Okay, so here's the situation... I have a ton of the charging wall plug adapters, as well as an assortment of Micro USB cables.  I also have this charging station:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K5MKBSO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1  I've been using this station quite a bit out of convenience, but I noticed something strange the other day.  I use a fairly short usb cable and it charges my devices (mostly an Nvidia Shield Tablet K1) quickly.  I wanted to use a longer cable, so I found one I had laying around, perhaps a two foot cable, plugged it in and left the tablet charging.  But it was charging much slower than the shorter one.  Section A of my question is the following:  Are there reasons for this slower charging?  Are there different qualities or types of cables?  Is there a way of looking at the cables or ends to see which is going to be a better option?  Or is it all just down to testing the cables out and tossing the bad ones?  I use the cables in the "normal" charging ports, not on the Super Charge if that makes a difference.  Part B of my question is related to the normal phone/tablet charging adapters.  I know that when I use an adapter that is rated too low for a device, I get very slow charging.  But is it possible to use one that's too strong?  Like could I do some damage to the device or it's battery if the adapter has too high of an amp/watt output?

The PSVR actually has the least pronounced "screen door effect" of the big three HMDs because of the type of screen they went with.   &gt;Not every 1080P screen is the same.

t3_4nuigv	t1_d4fpux5	1466367204	A) The charging speed can depend on the quality of the cable (although that's not such a big factor) and on the **length** of the cable. You should use short cables if you want the fastest charging possible  B) Well, sure you could damage something, else there wouldn't be recommended inputs. The faster your battery charges, the hotter it gets. The hotter it gets, the faster it's going to lose capacity.

t3_4oy4xh	t1_d4ghqwp	1466420410	That's interesting, but at the same time, useless for general audience. IIRC, a lot of software caps out at 4 or 8 cores, simply because it needs result from a previous operation to perform the next one. And we already have GPUs for encoding... though I'd like to see comparisons between what this one can do and top of the line CUDA system.  Anyway, bringing something like this into the fold would require a complete rewrite of our current software philosophy. And as of right now I do not see a reason why this architecture is preferable enough to start this massive process. Granted, its power-saving capabilities might be incredible, but I do not think it is enough.	demafromua	t3_4oy4xh
t3_4oy4xh	t1_d4ghz4f	1466421151	This is certainly not designed as a general-purpose consumer CPU and likely would be substantially outperformed by GPUs at workloads for which GPUs are ideally suited.

t3_4oy4xh	t1_d4gmp0f	1466431862	That is true, but the OS can still runs different threads and splits the load across separate cores. The benefit would be a faster run time with more individual programs, where they could run less serially.	Pryre	t1_d4gkdin
t3_4oy4xh	t1_d4gn2vo	1466432481	If you're lucky they might use 2 cores. Most software that the average person will come into contact with is still 32-bit and uses a single thread.

t3_4oyc49	t1_d4gy13s	1466447424	Exactly. The thing to remember is the bulk of the price tag is for the noise cancelling tech and not the headphones sound quality. I would say 2/3 is for the technology and 1/3 is the sound. So in perspective, you're buying a $100 pair of headphones, which as you would expect, sounds like a $100 pair.	FigFrontflip	t1_d4gwx7j

t3_4oy4xh	t1_d4h5bli	1466456876	The research paper is here: [A 5.8 pJ/Op 115 Billion Ops/sec, to 1.78 Trillion Ops/sec 32nm 1000-Processor Array](http://vcl.ece.ucdavis.edu/pubs/2016.06.vlsi.symp.kiloCore/2016.vlsi.symp.kiloCore.pdf)  The system appears to have been built to test theories about the performance of dense computing systems given the design trade-offs and features chosen, e.g. they don't use caches, have 1000 processors, 1000 packet routers, and 12 independent memories all with very flexible clocking to minimise power consumption. The architecture is MIMD so different from GPUs that are SIMD.  So this is not really a gadget device but something that might inform future computer design.	vwlsmssng	t3_4oy4xh

t3_4ox0lr	t1_d4hff4q	1466471882	&gt; I thought having a monopoly is illegal? Am I missing something?  A common misconception.  Having a monopoly is perfectly legal, and monopolies often exist with the blessing of regulatory agencies.  What is not legal is exploiting that monopoly to engage in what are called "anti-competitive practices."  For example, take the most classic case most of us are familiar with - Microsoft.  They had a de facto monopoly on operating systems for many years before running afoul of the law.  What finally attracted the attention of the justice department was their attempt to strongarm Compaq Computer into excluding Netscape from the default software included on their computers, under threat of losing their OEM pricing, which would have effectively put them out of business.  In this specific case with Segways, they do not have a monopoly -  they're just legally preventing other companies from infringing on their patent.  If someone came up with a method of building a hoverboard that was demonstrably different enough from their patent, it would be legal.  How ethical this is depends a lot on what you think of patent law, but that's another topic entirely.	TheBatmanToMyBruce	t1_d4h2tmh

Had to lug my bike to a fire station a ways up the road, on bike shoes (nb: firemen have really nice day-rooms and play a lot of video games when they're not saving lives). So there I realized I really should always carry my phone, not just a music device. Bonus: it has all of my music on it, not just what I remember to load. And an FM radio app. No loss of functionality. Somewhat more bulk but manageable.

t3_4p2wee	t1_d4hopiq	1466489270	Sadly my Zune's battery is not lasting as long as it used too; It was a device before smart phones not large that carried the majority of my music collection, meaning I had at least 75% of my music amd live concert recordings with me in the size of an iphone.  I have less music now and it is less to scroll through, but being able to bust out random hardly heard concerts or lost tapes at a party is very sweet.	CMYK2RGB	t3_4p2wee

t3_4p2wee	t1_d4i5ejq	1466526698	How about for sound quality? Seems strange that this wasn't even mentioned. A phone dac and amp are pretty bad and the hardware in any of the cheap mp3 players are hardly any better. You would have to spend $500+ for something good.	Sylanthra	t3_4p2wee

t3_4oyc49	t1_d4iig6z	1466542841	Think of it this way - the QC35 costs $50 more than the QC25, so you're really only paying $50 for bluetooth.  I'd say it's totally worth it - I really enjoy not having to worry about cords.	TheBatmanToMyBruce	t1_d4igtrm

t3_4oyc49	t1_d4ik51h	1466545043	Interesting - the QC35 isn't so much expensive as the QC25 is unusually cheap - they're $299USD down here ($380CAD).	TheBatmanToMyBruce	t1_d4ijv6n

t3_4oyc49	t1_d4ikce7	1466545318	They're fine - the button feel is ok and the control layout is the same as a wired remote.  That said, I'm super picky about controls, and while I don't *dislike* them, I'm also not really impressed.  I'd like a snappier click when the buttons are depressed, and a larger, more comfortable on-off switch.	TheBatmanToMyBruce	t1_d4ik94b
t3_4oyc49	t1_d4ikjky	1466545583	Sounds like I would be ok with them. Have to start saving now haha!	FigFrontflip	t1_d4ikce7
t3_4oyc49	t1_d4ikmnw	1466545698	I had just bought a pair of QC25s the weekend before these were announced, so for me it was a very straight-up $50 upgrade.  Worth it!	TheBatmanToMyBruce	t1_d4ikjky
t3_4oyc49	t1_d4ilcob	1466546689	Right on. I've had my QC-15's for about 6 years now so I think it's time to upgrade.	FigFrontflip	t1_d4ikmnw

There have been times when all the cell service is out, but our landline still works. Also, I do not get consistently good cell service at my house. So why not VOIP? Because if the power goes out, that goes down too.

t3_4piavv	t1_d4lo9ql	1466733811	I guess... But why stream it? If my brother wants to watch something, he can copy it from the jump drive to his hard drive and watch. Same goes for anyone else. Plus, I could plug it directly in to my laptop or tablet, but not my phone (I don't have a lightning to USB port converter). I guess I just prefer directly opening a file vs streaming in this type of situation. Because any situation I can have internet, I can stream from my desktop back home.	f1del1us	t1_d4lno4p

Maybe it doesn't workforce you - but then again I doubt you are the ideal customer for them.  That doesn't mean I'm irrational or ignorant.

t3_4pm9as	t1_d4n59lh	1466825760	Not really.  Making it so that the battery was internal gives them a lot more design and hardware options.  People are going to buy a new phone every 2 years because its shiny and new.	BANNEDFROMALAMO	t1_d4n2pdj

t3_4pm9as	t1_d4n68oh	1466827722	Expandable memory absolutely. Battery I think is less important.  Not having a removable battery can simply be mended by a $20 power bank off of Amazon.

t3_4pm9as	t1_d4n93ju	1466834350	That, and with a very inexpensive set of tools the battery can be replaced even if it's a 'non removable' type. You won't be keeping a spare in your pocket and swapping it in half way through the day, but you can certainly replace the battery if it gets tired before you're ready to buy another phone	GinjaNinja-NZ	t1_d4n59lh

t3_4pm9as	t1_d4na1s3	1466837148	Not really, replacing the battery is still very doable. It just takes a few extra minutes or paying a cell phone repair shop a few bucks. The upside of it is more design options, tighter seal, thinner phones and better quality build.	ChuckVader	t1_d4n2pdj

t3_4pm9as	t1_d4na7je	1466837643	It is still cheaper than the apple upgrade or more storage for the same price. It also provides an upgrade option for those who bought the cheapest option thinking it would be enough for them and later finding out it wasn't.	bistix	t1_d4mytbx

t3_4pm9as	t1_d4nhcnm	1466861913	Again. One of the cheapest components of that device is the memory... just because YOU stream doesn't mean most other people do. You drank the Kool aid.  Lmao. All that music is available online and I'd rather pay the artist then put more money into a company that lives by product obsolescence.  And you are still being ignorant to the fact that most other phones come with SD. They could give that option, but no. They say fuck you, everything, single, time. They make their products harder to repair every single generation.  I'm not alone in my sentiment. Another point as well, most plans aren't unlimited, and unless you haven't t-mobile, you're probably going to end up paying for data unless you're only listening on WiFi or just not that much music. And like I said in the last message. The tiering of memory is the saddest thing of all.... A USB of 128 go is about 50 bucks give or take...... Even if you don't need it, it shouldn't still be available to you,  you shouldn't have to shell out even more money if I have my library on my computer and don't find a need to stream. Basically apple says oh you don't want to stream and pay us? Well fuck you then.	BelovedOdium	t1_d4mys32

t3_4piavv	t1_d4nmpai	1466871757	They're not always exactly the same though. I've ripped open several such drives and plugged them into a regular IDE bus and every single time (and I'm talking at least 4 or 5 of these suckers) they overheat and burn out very quickly, like weeks not months.   So, I think they might be stripped down drives without heat sensors or with important code or something in the enclosure part of the device not in the HD where it would normally be.	account_1100011	t1_d4nd0pr

t3_4pm9as	t1_d4nnx06	1466873721	I had a mophie space pack for a year and the battery stopped working about 8 months in. I still kept it because I liked the extra storage, but the app they make you use was so horrible that you couldn't use it without it crashing. I used the case until I got an iPhone 6s and when I got the 6s I went for the 64gb model so I have no need for a space pack. This SanDisk one looks to be much cheaper, and actually better looking.	da_bomb3	t1_d4n8i5x
t3_4pm9as	t1_d4no3zl	1466874033	Sandisk is asshole-ish. They should have made a case that takes standard SD cards instead of selling a case for $100+ which is so expensive that you might as well pay for a bigger iPhone in the first place.	kermityfrog	t1_d4mhv7l

t3_4loba7	t1_d4np6ee	1466875777	There are literally dozens of "Zenbooks" over the last 4 years, ranging from $400 to $2500.  Your comment doesn't say anything about a specific "Zenbook" either. It's a brand name with the only universal similarity being "pretty and fast". Otherwise, build quality varies wildly with the model (and the price). My 2013 "Zenbook Infinity", for example, has my favorite touchpad and keyboard of any laptop I've used, bar the Macbook Air, and it has no issues keeping up with high-end 2016 ultrabooks.   Buy one of the $500 low-end models in the early ux305 series, and you will definitely see some compromises.	alexaday	t1_d3pc5ar
t3_4loba7	t1_d4nq0lt	1466877153	To be fair, where IS the comparable windows ultrabook? I think that Asus made a good decision 2 years ago when they decided to ignore the PC market and start focusing the Macbook market. The dozen Zenbooks iterations since then all targeted the corresponding apple device: the ux305s are cheaper MBA replicas, the ux303s are cheaper MBP replicas, the ux501s are as close to a MBP15 challenge as you could get.  But then when Asus does their crazy engineering shit every few years, where is the windows comparison? The ux301la was the first broadwell ultrabook iirc, and it was straight up marketed as a "MBP in a MBA body". Here they are pushing for a MBP in a MacBook body. Another Zenbook getting released at the same time as this shoves 1.5TB, nvidia 940M GPU, i7 6700u, 2K screen, 4 full ports into the "body of a MacBook air".   Heck, these come in _Rose Gold_. lol They themselves want to be the Apple of the PC market.	alexaday	t1_d3p8rsb

But with Nexus devices the exact configuration is a known quantity and I can't think of any technical limitation that would prevent Google from serving them updates directly like Apple does.

t3_4q2os5	t1_d4pqkhs	1467028803	There is no chance they plan on building manufacturing factories. Foxconn, or some other OEM will be the manufacturer. In which case the same question applies -- how is this different? Other companies will feed in processors and camera sensors and screens, memory chips and storage, and it will be assembled just like every other device.  Google already guides the hardware, the design, things like the move away from physical (even capacitive) buttons, etc.  This rumor appears yearly. It never makes any sense at all, and is usually rationalized by clearly wrong claims (and recall this was the big claim when Google bought Motorola -- which they did to eliminate a patent war threat -- "now there's going to be official, perfect Google devices!" They bored of that super quickly).. The single and only benefit would be that maybe Google could claim a larger amount of the take, but that take is not only usually tiny, sometimes it's a negative (the Pixel C is a great example, because it has almost certainly been a financial disaster for Google).	beavertime	t1_d4pq09s

t3_4q2os5	t1_d4pqlvx	1467028907	Its different because google doesn't own the manufacturer.  Actually google bought Motorola and sold it about a year later, while it owned the manufacturer, it produced Nexus 6.  Google sold it because Samsung and other phone manufacturers were getting scared of google controlling both the android development and phone-manufacturing. Rumors started flying around that non Google phones will have to wait a really long time for any software updates and, as a result Samsung and others were making heavier modifications to Googles android system.   Google and others interpreted it as phone manufacturers getting ready to make the leap to build their own OS. This was not the direction Google wanted to go in it likes everyone using all of their apps. As a result it sold of Motorola, since then people eased up software mods too, plus google got nice patents from Motorola as well and lost about 8 billion dollars between the buy and sell price.	thegreenmushrooms	t1_d4ppgn8
t3_4q2os5	t1_d4pqnbv	1467029010	You could buy the N6 directly from google but put an att sim in it and it puts you on their update path. I don't think this happens with any other Nexus phones but it does happen with the N6 and ATT. By the time people noticed it the option was to wait for ATT to release the update or wipe it with a factory image directly from google. It could had been avoided by booting the phone for the first time with a non-att sim and then swapping sim cards afterwards.  http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/01/21/psa-if-your-nexus-6-has-an-att-sim-card-your-android-updates-are-being-withheld-but-it-doesnt-actually-matter/	CiDhed	t1_d4pq6dt

t3_4q2os5	t1_d4pqqjx	1467029243	I bought an original Moto X during the period when Google owned Motorola because I thought it would mean a better updating experience than other manufacturers, and I got burned. As it is now, Google's inability to control the Android update process is like welfare for device manufacturers who withhold or delay updates to entice you into buying a new phone. My Moto X (2013) is suffering some serious hardware rot and can hardly send or receive calls anymore, but I'm definitely not buying another Moto, or giving my money to any of the other Android handset makers until Google sorts their shit out. In the meantime I use my work iPhone for calls and in certain ways it's a better experience.	PeanutNore	t1_d4ppooy
t3_4q2os5	t1_d4pqr38	1467029282	Depends on how high end or which phone do you get. I have used both Galaxy S6 and Nexus 6P and I prefer Galaxy S6 in many ways. Other than the brilliant camera and screen, Samsung has added so many great features like splitwindow,multiwindow, resizing the size of an app so you can effectively open as many apps you want etc. You will realize once you use it. Samsung had this since almost 2 years and it is just now coming to Android N and only splitwindow is coming, not multiwindow.  I have been recieving regular updates on my S6. Third party manufacturers are great for the ecosystem. Exclusivity is not good.	Devam13	t1_d4ppm17
t3_4q2os5	t1_d4pqt49	1467029423	They do. Just dont buy phones from the carrier. They are the problem with a lot of this. I stopped buying Samsung phones because I was tired of all the S-Apps and AT&amp;T Apps I never use.   I honestly couldn't believe how clean my phone was when I got my Nexus 6p. Was bascially just a few google apps installed and that was it. No list of	General_Stobo	t1_d4pqdw1
t3_4q2os5	t1_d4pqtno	1467029460	Apple isn't that vertically integrated. The screens and flash memory in iPhones are mostly made by Samsung, the cameras are Sony, the SoC is made in a third party fab and the whole thing is assembled by Foxconn. It's sheer volume of production, not vertical integration, that keeps the cost under control. Anyone could use the same third party suppliers to build a device to the same quality level, and Google could afford to take a loss at first to get the volume up to profitability.

t3_4q2os5	t1_d4pqxkw	1467029735	Apple designs it all. Apple aren't buying a Samsung ARM processor, Samsung are fabricating ARM chips using Apple's designs. It's the same with virtually all Apple components. Apple's ARM designs are some of the best in the world, and on the iPhone they usually result in the fastest smartphones in the world according to real world benchmarks. I'm sure Google has the heft to do the same but Apple's been at it for a long while now. I hope Google does get it right and gives Apple's designs a run for their money. The next iPhone could always do with being just that little bit faster.	WhatInYourPants	t1_d4pqtno

LG even admitted to sacrificing battery capacity AND wireless charging in order to place the fingerprint sensor in a certain spot. which is fucking dumb.  price is markedly higher. whereas nexus up until now has always been about value for money rather than unnecessary frills.  STILL no sd card slot, and no improvement on the internal storage space over the 5. 16gb on the base model is absolutely ridiculous in 2016  from my own testing, even with the "faster" processor, the phone runs at almost exactly the same speed as the 5.  2gb of ram in a $380 phone is fucking embarrassing  the battery and storage were the weakest aspects of the nexus 5. and the price point was its strongest. for the 5x they made literally no improvements to the weak points, and made the strong point worse  even 3 years on. the 5 is a better value phone than the 5x.	flyonthwall	t1_d4pqh0v

t3_4q2os5	t1_d4pr95g	1467030514	I recently went from a 5 to a 5X and I've noticed nothing but improved performance. Sure the 5 was 3 years old and had taken the standard beating but I think the 5X is far superior directly out of the box than the 5.  Also who pays $380 for a 5X when you can get it for $200 through ProjectFi, cancel the service, then put the phone on whatever carrier you want.  If you know how to buy it the 5X is the same value if not better than the 5.  Edit: cause of the individual below me.	enzo86	t1_d4pqyi8
t3_4q2os5	t1_d4pr9be	1467030524	$380? Dude what? It's going for mid 200s as far as I know. And no SD Card slot is a given for Nexi, you should've known. And day to day performance of Nexus 4 and 5 is same. Is 5 shit because of that? No. I get the battery problems and wireless charging but I love how the phone looks. And yes, storage is a problem, but for me, 32GB is *just* safe.   &gt; for the 5x they literally made no improvements to the weak points   Ah, yes, the camera on the 5X is absolutely trash I agree with you yeah yup. That was the most shat on point of the 5 as far as I know.   5 is a great value phone, no doubt. But 5X is coming close. But if you want wireless charging go to 5. If not, 5X. I heard of a deal where it was going for $230. That's a good deal. I myself want to buy a 6p (priced in mid 400s) but will wait till the new Nexi release so that 6p drops to mid 300s. Prices drop, magic right?   Edit: I don't own a 5x by the way.	HereComesPapaArima	t1_d4pqyi8

I don't know why but you guys have to rely on your mobile carriers for your updates. Obviously there is room for improvement but I personally really enjoy the features Samsung adds.  Now that bloatware is not installed on Samsung phones like it was years ago, I am pretty certain my next phone will be Samsung too.  But if you live in the US and have to rely on carriers for updates, you may have a different story.	Devam13	t1_d4prj1e
t3_4q2os5	t1_d4prniv	1467031423	Twice. The problem began after we moved to a new building at work that's basically a Faraday cage, and the phone, which is on Verizon, was basically running the cellular radio at max power full time to try and reach the tower. It would consistently become extremely hot and stay hot all day, and I think it was damaged by doing this. My iPhone is on AT&amp;T and is able to get a reliable though not very good signal and doesn't heat up.	PeanutNore	t1_d4pqy4a
t3_4q2os5	t1_d4prrjs	1467031672	Sure, they'll use subcontractors. But they'll have more control over design &amp; production, more consumer confidence in the product, and, as many people point out, even if they take a loss it's going to put pressure on 3rd party manufacturers and improve the Android name in the long run.  Google Fiber didn't make them a quick buck, neither did Project Fi. Their autonomous cars aren't making them any money. We're talking about a company that has always innovated and explored new avenues. I don't see any reason Google wouldn't produce their own flagship Android devices to represent their brand, even if that means operating at a loss for a while.	mrHwite2	t1_d4pqkhs
t3_4q2os5	t1_d4ps1uk	1467032300	5X was $350 at launch or something while 5 was 20-30 less. Oh well.    Edit: Just checked. The 5x (60h) improves on the 5's (38-40) battery by 20 hours (GSMArena Endurance Ratings). So they improved, not as much as you'd like it.

Both have been heavily panned and are grossly overpriced. Remember the Nexus Q? Yeah, that was fully made within Google.  Honestly, in what world would anyone have more "confidence" in Google hardware versus Samsung or HTC or LG? This is an argument derived from fantasy land.  Google doesn't make screens. Google doesn't make processors (well, not mobile ones). Google doesn't make memory chips or storage chips or anything else. Like everyone else they would be putting things together.  &gt;We're talking about a company that has always innovated and explored new avenues.  This is just meaningless patter. I mean, this same rumor has appeared yearly since the beginning of Android. The purchase of Motorola was supposed to make it real....crashed to the ground.

t3_4q2os5	t1_d4pthhd	1467035054	If I'm honest with myself, I'm inclined to agree with you. Android updates have been the bane of my existence ever since everything past the G1.   Unfortunately, the open OS model is a double edged sword. On one hand, users have the freedom to do with their phone as they wish. This has been my driving force in supporting Android for the past 8 years. On the other hand, the same open model is what is keeping Android from becoming a true Apple competitor. Allowing for any manufacturer to use the base software also allows for these manufacturers to add their bloat and slow or even kill updates to their hardware. But even that is linked to the real problem in the consumer tech world of planned obsolescence. Greed, it seems, is the real problem here.  I just want to buy a phone with good hardware that is obviously capable of running the latest and greatest operating system for more than 2 years that isn't part of a walled garden eco system. Shit, even something that will last (with manufacturer update support) for 3 years would be worth it to me, but even Google is dropping Nexus devices from their software support (that are more than capable) after 2 years!

If you need to contrive bullshit to support rumor, the rumor is most certainly false.  &gt;Why does Google continue to sell the Chromebook Pixel if it's a failure?  I don't think you understand how this all works. See, Google spent all of the money on design and meetings and planning and coordination and orchestrating suppliers to make the product. Simply continuing to manufacture the device is a marginal cost (made by a company like Foxconn) in comparison. Google *thought* the Pixel would be a big deal. They did ad campaigns and made a really big deal about it.  Then it flopped to the floor like a dead fish. It will slowly move away from appearance, and there will be no successor.	beavertime	t1_d4pwyub

t3_4qj1am	t1_d4u2ld4	1467301132	The G Flex 2 is over a year old and probably won't get many more software updates and if they do, they'll be at a slower pace than Motorola since LG devices are still (albeit lightly) skinned. Also missing is a fingerprint scanner and water resistance. Another minor gripe/downside for someone might be their inability to customize their device with motomaker. I don't see how one can go wrong with either one tbh. That's the beauty of Android devices is choice.  It really depends on what the end user wants.	db8cn	t1_d4u0fnh

t3_4qj1am	t1_d4uce9i	1467313543	You are right. That is something that I recently realized: flagships from a year or two ago have the same specs as current budget phones. Even better sometimes, like the Flex 2 as you mentioned.   I guess people don't think about getting the S6 over a year after it comes out, even though it beats other budget phones.   I know that carriers usually offer deals on flagships when they are released (T-mobile had bog for S7). So it comes out to $400 for each S7. If you have the cash, i would think this would be a better deal than getting say a One plus 3 or moto g.	I-touched-the-butt	t1_d4u0fnh

I can't even describe how often my glass screen and shock proof case has saved my S5 from damage due to slips, drops, wrenches, etc.   Having edge screens are honestly kinda tacky, and more of a fad like 3D tvs were, imo. Having edge screen only devices is just blocking a lot of sales simply for a designer feature.   I was super excited for this phone since I've heard it is to be water resistant with a great battery, but this really kills the deal for me. Only choice for me personally is the S8 or S7 Active, as I will be sticking with Samsung devices.	nicdoesacomment	t1_d4v7tf2
t3_4qpzbi	t1_d4v8ts7	1467376360	I have a S7e. I decided to put up with the curved screen in order to get a bigger display and more battery life. I dislike the curved screen - it makes holding the phone harder, typing harder, and pulling out side menus harder.

It seems as though the loss of grip space due to having a curved portion of screen right where your hands go isn't so great for gripping it, almost odd I suppose.

t3_4qj1am	t1_d4wttzm	1467484658	We've hit a point now where most smartphones that have more than 2GB of RAM will work just fine for most tasks. This means that the real value is in older flagship phones rather than the new low and midrange devices.   Personally, I have an LG G2 that probably compares quite nicely to the G4, and I love it. When that dies, I'll probably move to a 6p if I can find one, although buying used means that I'll want to find something with a removable battery if that's possible.  Either way, the value right now is in using a flagship from a year or two ago.	theusualuser	t3_4qj1am

t3_4qj1am	t1_d4y38ox	1467581768	The Smart Ultra 7 is better and cheaper at £135 compared to £160 for the Moto G4. For £300 you can the Smart Platinum 7 which has a 1440p screen and includes a VR headset. Those headsets usually cost around £100 so if they release the Platinum 7 without it, it'll probably cost around £200 which would be £30 cheaper than the 32 GB Moto G4 Plus. The Platinum 7 is far superior to the Moto G4 Plus though.	MarcusOrlyius	t3_4qj1am
t3_4qj1am	t1_d4ybp1u	1467597125	It's really a shame this came about right when I'm looking for an upgrade, because the G3 seems like a perfect low-budget phone. Adding inane features like a fingerprint reader and dropping good design qualities (waterproofing, a flat back) does not a good budget phone make. I just want a better G3.  I also wonder why they fragmented the G line so much. Was the E not selling well enough for them to refresh it (presumably with the G Play's specs, and slightly different design) and just keep the G as the middle-road no-nonsense Moto?

t3_4r70r6	t1_d4zbyhq	1467672448	This is a fairly standard delta printer, but they've put the print bed on the delta arms instead of the print head (or hot end).  Normally the bed would be stationary and the hot end would be moving around, but this model has the hot end stationary and the bed moves.  This means that the bed should only hold a certain amount of weight before the weight begins to alter the print quality negatively.  Each pair of those arms you see is attached to a carriage which is attached to a belt and the belt is moved by a NEMA motor. The X, Y, and Z are corners of a triangle and the three motors move to be able to reach all points within the build container of the printer.  Most people run a delta with a bowden hot end (basically the extruder motor that feeds the plastic in is held somewhere else and feeds plastic through a PTFE tube to the hot end) so they don't even have the extra weight of an extruder motor supported by their delta arms.  Considering an extruder motor weighs about 250g - I would think this printer will suffer in quality printing items over 200g or 300g.  Notice how in the samples all the larger prints are vases, they have to offset the weight problem by printing hollow objects.  This may be decent for printing small samples, but for the price, you'd expect much more.  The build quality does look nice, but I think the design would have been better with a 4-tube bowden feed and something like E3D's Kraken hotend. I'm fairly sure you could find some mods online of people who run such a setup.   _________________________________________________________________________________ I personally have a Rostock Max v2 Delta printer, so if you're good at soldering and building - that's a great option.  There is also a similarly priced Hatchbox brand Delta printer on Amazon that's already assembled.  Again, on 3D printers, I'd recommend against them if you don't have technical ability or the patience to invest in reading on how to properly operate and maintain them.  Deltas are also considered more prone to calibration problems than a standard Cartesian model. If you want a starter 3d printer, I'd recommend a Monoprice Select Mini at $199 - which minimizes the investment if you decide 3d printing isn't right for you.	printering	t3_4r70r6

Those sushi pieces are printed. Shoes are printed. Glasses. The automotive console is printed and the wood grain is printed on it as well. J750 is a ridiculous machine. You can overlay an image on your stl models and it will print them. Thats how that telescope housing is done. Same with woodgrain, and sushi. Its legit all printed and no false advertising. Its getting that good at looking like the real products. The shoes are just colour mixed on the printer using a soft printed rubber. I work on all of the stratasys machines and we have a j750 at the office...plus a few other machines	SelfCockBlock	t1_d4zpdnd

t3_4r70r6	t1_d4zrbfz	1467704957	Not just colour gradients, but full images. The space and stars image on the telescope was printed on the housing as is. No painting or airbrushing. The surface image was put onto the stl file. The j750 prints it onto the model.	SelfCockBlock	t1_d4zlbv5
t3_4r70r6	t1_d4zrcjy	1467705062	I was getting components 3D printed back in 2004. And even THEN it was dated technology.

t3_4r70r6	t1_d4zs0vd	1467707416	I'm very particular about where I store my shampoo. Actually the truth isn't that intersting. I designed machinery for Unilever. Wouldn't see final blow molded bottles until pretty much day one of production. The equipment customisation required around 12 weeks of preparation so it was a small price to pay for a test bottle. Tolerances were crap and we used to baby the fuckers or they'd break. Surface finish wasn't too much of a consideration for me to design with.	Frog-sack	t1_d4zru2a
t3_4qpzbi	t1_d4ztazj	1467712234	I agree that whoever they do, it'll be preferable to Samsung's current crop.   I can't help but feel that htc don't really fit with the nexus ethos properly though.   This is just my opinion of course, but I always get the feeling they focus more on the materials and look of the phone than the actual hardware and user experience.   I haven't really been impressed with any of their phones for the last couple of years, and the last tablet they made for nexus wasn't exactly a roaring success either.    Who knows, maybe this new crop will turn out ok. I may just end up sticking with my 6P though, as soon as I repair the screen that is.	absent-v	t1_d4zgtat

If you were to keep up the news the exact opposite is true in fact and Xiaomi is going after US company's violating their patents, although that case admittedly is about hoverboards not cell phones but it serves to help illustrate them as a company both interested in establishing themselves within the United States as well as one willing to work within United States' law. Xiaomi already sells their fitness band and their action camera within the US market through legitimate official channels and yet they haven't been instantly sued by fitbit or gopro so I really don't see any reasonable argument that their phones would be any different.	clariance	t1_d50szac

t3_4rqvuu	t1_d545z0c	1467981223	There's a product available in Australia called Shotbox. I'm not sure if its global. My other half sold them alongside GoPro so we ended up with one of each.

t3_4rqvuu	t1_d54u545	1468014668	Please dont update, (if you have the hero 2). The thing is i did my research in time and told my brothers not to update cause i read somwhere that it was a no-go. Anyhow, my little bro forgot about that. Aparently. And told me "you know what? We never done the update for this one" . Long story short, the camera doesn't record one out of two times you ask for it. Even when it does it may stop suddenly. We ran an obstacle-mud-race and had to check every five minutes that it was in fact turned on. I mad at the brand and don't recommend updating anything until you check it ok to do it.  But I may have overreacted; I still believe GoPro is way better than the other options. Even Sony; their camera lens catches drops of water on the sea, blocking the whole picture ruining the shot.

t3_4qpzbi	t1_d55gump	1468068279	Ok getting ready for the down-votes.....the only reason that I will definitely be upgrading (again) from the S7 Edge to the Note 7 is because they're giving it the curved edge.  When I made a choice a few months ago between the Note 5 and the S7 Edge, I really wanted the S Pen, but ultimately I wanted the ultra-cool looks of the curved screen more.  Now that I can have both, I'm definitely getting this.  And as to why Samsung is doing this....it's no secret that the S7 Edge....even more so than the regular S7...has become Samsung's bestselling phone this year.

There is nothing premium about a stock card. It is definitely lower quality, slower, uglier, and hotter than the aftermarket designs.

t3_4sacz7	t1_d587gex	1468263255	Intel NUC's are pretty small, but they won't actually dangle off the back of any monitor the way that these will. This fits nicely in the price point between the Pentium and i5 NUC and could easily slide behind a wall-mounted HDTV.    I'm not sure how many IT departments would chose it over something a little bigger for mini-desktops, but it does have its potential uses.	The_Wisenheimer	t1_d584hto
t3_4sacz7	t1_d58810n	1468264019	Almost everything I've read in non-consumer centric literature positions these kinds of devices as platforms for digital signage systems. For example, these could be used to easily distribute signs by advertising agencies to airports, train stations, malls, etc. A lot of the current stuff on the market is still some crappy old tower CPU that needs cables and power strips that can be screwed up onsite all sold back starting at $2000+ / mo (which is a bargain for advertising in a mall, btw). The cost of the raw equipment is only a small fraction of the price of a solution and nobody gives a crap about cost-effectiveness until after the initial prototypes / POCs are deployed and showing promise. This is why the Windows v. Linux argument never mattered for most business scenarios - until you get into really large scale, the cost of developing and operating the software is the larger cost than licensing of all things.  I'd be curious to see how well Intel has managed to convert sales for their new i7 NUC and these compute sticks to b2b by using typically b2c marketing channels. Given the whole recent lay-offs the other month, I'm not sure what to think.	djk29a_	t1_d584hto

t3_4r5pxh	t1_d59evp4	1468343259	If you have a good computer running an nvidia graphics card (I think its like models 600 and above), you can stream the games from your computer at home to your tablet. Ive seen some youtube videos where people are able to play like a hundred miles from home with very little lag. The only bad thing ive heard about it is something about the power button gets stuck, but everything else seems to be top notch on that thing. The only draw back to buying one tho is that you have to buy everything else seperately (i dont even think it comes with a microUSB cable) including the cover, a remote controller if you want it, the stylus, and the usb power outlet thing.	triggerhappy899	t1_d54gylt

t3_4spmqk	t1_d5bacz3	1468453476	You can! [Filabot!](https://www.filabot.com) Unfortunately, it's a separate machine, which is probably a good thing considering you need a heavy duty heating element and auger, and the device can cost as much as the printer itself. Also, the nature of a lot of plastic designed for 3D printing means that unless you precisely control the temperature, remelting it makes it turn black and ugly. However, you can melt and reuse your waste plastic from previous prints, buy affordable plastic pellets and create your own filament, and even create filament with plastics you find around you, like milk bottles, but few household plastics make for even halfway decent filament.  Unless you're printing difficult parts on multiple printers nonstop, the Filabot isn't remotely worth it. Also, the machine (and therefore company) was a Kickstarter, and last I really checked 3 months ago, they were still doing a terrible job of shipping the machines as donor rewards for the 10x more people than they thought would contribute to the campaign.  Also, this pen doesn't deserve to be called "3D" anything. It's just garbage.	R0ckitJump	t1_d5b62g5

t3_4sy806	t1_d5daqkn	1468591528	It's a bigger issue when Apple does it because of how big they are causing a major divide. This phone will sell less than 1/100th that of the next iPhone, causing far less e-waste.  Additionally USB-C is becoming the next USb standard after micro-usb and inspite of Apple inclusion in the Macbook will undoubtedly use lightning for the iPhone 7 continuing the trend of increase e-waste.  **tl;dr Lenovo are moving from one standard to the next generation of said standard.

t3_4sy806	t1_d5dedo8	1468596743	I guess I don't keep up with android phones.  If they removed the audio port to use usb micro?  yes, i would still oppose it.  99.99% of phones made have the 3.5mm plugin.  Either you need and adapter you have to carry around with you and not lose or you need a headphone that you can't use with nearly every other device.  Its a stupid sacrifice for literally mm's of width on a phone.  Nobody is clamoring "omg, my phone is SO thick, why can't it be paper thin!?".	Brookstone317	t1_d5ddz77
t3_4sy806	t1_d5dekjy	1468596996	99.99% one had all kinds or archaic ports and specs, yet you don't seem to be going out of your way to by a serial port laptop.  Losing it makes the phone sturdier and potentially more waterproof.  I agree we shouldn't be removing it right now, the effort should be making wireless charging more universal while also shipping with USB-C headphones (with the old 3.5mm legacy port still on the device) all to encourage USB-C adoption and bring down the price. Then maybe in 2 or 3 years remove 3.5mm  But just suddenly going  "Bye, bye"   Is just wrong in my mind especially with so few USB-C/lightning headphones.  My argument is that your argument can be used on nearly every single device as it evolve from GPU's no longer having VGA to radios no longer having 7mm.	mrv3	t1_d5dedo8
t3_4sy806	t1_d5dewvi	1468597449	I can see your point, but your analogs are bad choices.  Serial ports were not widely used outside of computers.  the 3.5mm port is widely used and not specific to a single product or product line.  And yes, going from coax to hdmi took years while the transition provided both choices (many still do have coax).  The drive for change was obvious in that case though, HDMI was simply superior   I do not see why 3.5mm need to be replaced though.  Why are other ports a better solution?  If it is mostly to help reduce width, I don't feel its a valid reason.	Brookstone317	t1_d5dekjy
t3_4sy806	t1_d5df6i6	1468597794	With any luck nor will USB-C, which won't (and isn't) used for just phones.   USB-C is becoming ever more common and popular and brings a great many benefits.   Take Kindle, for most(including amazon) the inclusion of 3.5mm doesn't make sense, it adds cost, bulk and issues with design, but their next gen kindle may choose USB-C at which point the inclusion of audio-out is made easier with little to no additional hardware.  Most external speakers which are typically powered by USB and have 3.5mm can now just have 1 port.   I'm saying that the move to a universal port for everything, audio, video, transfer, power, and high-power, means the death of older technology.   I wouldn't mind my non-standard laptop plug being replaced with USB-C would you?  I wouldn't mind my TV power being replaced with USB-C.  I wouldn't mind HDMi being replaced with USB-C.  SO with all the ways USB-C can change cables why not gradually put it for audio.	mrv3	t1_d5dewvi
t3_4sy806	t1_d5dfvh4	1468598710	I'm not arguing that newer standards that make improvements shouldn't be used.  Some of your points I agree with.  And the idea of having 1 cable to do everything is really nice (seriously, 1 cable to a monitor?  yes please!).  I don't think there is an improvement from the 3.5mm to USB.  3.5mm does everything you need it to do and there really isn't any room for improvement.  What can you add to a basic headphones?  You have power, left and right signals (although the addition of the command was really nice for inline volume, but there they added and made it backwards compatiable).  Don't change something for the sake of change.	Brookstone317	t1_d5df6i6

t3_4sy806	t1_d5dhhf1	1468600833	Quality is largely dependent on the audio chipset decoding the content. The 3.5mm jack is bare metal, any loss in quality isn't happening at the port.  I don't know what "fitness tracking earphones" is supposed to mean.  Battery life on newer smartphones is weak enough as it is, why would you want to draw power out of your phone to recharge peripherals?  Who do you know that daisy-chains wired headphones instead of using Bluetooth?  What more needs to be added to the media controls that isn't already present, and can't be done using Bluetooth?  It seems like you're trying to create a solution for a problem that doesn't exist (or is already solved in much more efficient ways, e.g. Bluetooth)	shdarren	t1_d5dgr53

Soon all phones will use USB-C ports and headphones will use those instead. You can wirelessly charge your phone while listening to music and that will become more and more common place as well as time passes. Also we see tech getting smaller, so in time the space that the jack takes up could give you significantly more battery life. Tech will always be growing and unfortunately that means our old gadgets will need adapters and one day will be irrelevant, but if that weren't true we would still use floppy disks and only have wired home phones.

t3_4sy806	t1_d5dw9az	1468621201	No. I used to own bluetooth headphones and the battery wasn't particularly large (lasted for hours) but on long flights would eventually die, I could eith recharge using an external one and listen over 3.5mm but the cables became a nightmare. Having the phone charge the bluetooth headphones would streamline the process.  Plus if you could so easily charge them from the phone with the standard cable you could very easily just make the internal battery on the headphones much smaller only giving 2 hours knowing for many people that's plenty for a run/walk.	mrv3	t1_d5dvrmt

t3_4sy806	t1_d5ecn45	1468655587	Show me any significant group of people that are happy about losing the 3.5 mm port. The only ones who don't mind are the ones saying that USB C is far better, and should be used more anyway - which is true, but just suddenly dumping a universal standard for no good reason without phasing in an alternative first is stupid, and nothing but a money grab. Heck, even after USB C and wireless charging become more prevalent, there's no reason to drop the port unless you're going for waterproofing - it's not like it's a particularly expensive component.	SirVer51	t1_d5dpddb
t3_4sy806	t1_d5ekyk3	1468681355	&gt; Show me any significant group of people that are happy about losing the 3.5 mm port.   I never claimed anything about it being "significant". All I was saying is "different people have different preferences". Saying something hyperbolic like: "This isn't something consumers want".... is a broad sweeping generalization/stereotype.   But regardless of other factors... it's happening. Multiple vendors (from smartphones to headphones to earbuds to other accessories) are all already moving in that direction. So spending a bunch of energy/time/resources whining about it is a giant waste of time.   No doubt that certain niche/3rd party companies will still continue to make devices with analog ports... and you'll be free to buy those if that's what you prefer.	jmnugent	t1_d5ecn45

t3_4tbdo4	t1_d5g0hdu	1468788466	$109 for something that the public might use once and lose, or they could just use more sunscreen instead. This device might be useful as a free-to-use public beach addition that allows someone to select "self-use" mode or "partner" mode, where the self-use mode will allow you to replay a video once and then it's automatically deleted. The partner mode shouldn't record any video at all. This way people can be confident that the next person using a public device doesn't see the previous person's video. I also don't think it should use an eye port, because that's just nasty. It should have a tiny screen instead.	Buckwheat469	t3_4tbdo4

t3_4tbdo4	t1_d5g1j75	1468790081	Remember folks: you need to *reapply* sunscreen often. Almost everyone uses sunscreen incorrectly. Do not worry about having SPF 100 or some nonsense, either. SPF 30 is fine, and any higher is not doing much for you. Also, for obvious reasons, get waterproof sunscreen. Thorough coverage with frequent reapplication can significantly shield you from unwanted effects of UV radiation.

t3_4tbdo4	t1_d5g2ly8	1468791850	My family would have used the crap out of this growing up. Clip it to the beach bag and it'll probably stick around (keeping track of things isn't hard). Now instead of having to ask "Did you get your ears? Who needs someone to get their back? Are you sure you got your entire face?" mom can just turn on the thing and look over everyone. Putting sunscreen on two adults and three kids is not a small part of the beach or pool routine. This would mean better coverage with fewer mistakes and quicker confirmation of when the job is done or when you're putting sunscreen on your shoulder for the 4th time.  And the viewfinder/screen thing is covered. They used a viewfinder because making screens visible in bright light is difficult/expensive.  It's not for everyone and the form factor could use some work but this pretty good as novel gadgets go.	SparklingLimeade	t1_d5g0hdu

t3_4tbdo4	t1_d5g355j	1468792747	I think it's a brilliant device, especially given the portability of it, but I think they'll really struggle with a price point that high. Given the amount of people who would benefit from the product, I think they would do better to sell more units at a cheaper price, than fewer units for a higher price. It would be very easy to get their product associated with a campaign for skin damage/cancer awareness, but not if the price range is too high for the average consumer.	BOBALOBAKOF	t3_4tbdo4

t3_4tbdo4	t1_d5g3dg7	1468793135	Yeah the only solution I can think of is a UV filter coupled with some kind of UV fluorescent film to shift the UV wavelength into the visible spectrum.	rlrgr	t1_d5g372o
t3_4tbdo4	t1_d5g3mru	1468793580	Photographer here.  Digital camera sensors are sensitive to more than just visible light.  They can record infrared and ultraviolet but if they do it messes up the colors in your normal visible light photo.  To avoid this every digital camera has a filter right over the sensor that blocks infrared light.  It turns out that glass is a pretty good UV blocker and there is a coating on the front of most lenses to block more UV.  There are companies that will remove the IR blocking filter and replace it with a visible light blocking filter allowing you to take photos like this.  The chlorophyll in plant leaves reflects infrared so it looks very white.  https://www.lifepixel.com/wp-content/gallery/mike-irwin-infrared-photography-gallery/3-infrared-photography-mike-irwin.jpg  UV requires using special lenses or carefully grinding off the lens coating.	bobj33	t1_d5g2rg8

t3_4tbdo4	t1_d5g4cdq	1468794784	This seems like a wonderful idea. $109 isn't much if it will last for many years. If the people in this thread had their way, we'd never invent or sell anything.   Pay $109 for a wheel? What! We can pull the plow the field without a wheel for free. It just takes some extra work.  Side note... It would be great if they could invent a similar device for poison ivy. It takes hours for the oil from poison ivy/oak plants to actually cause skin issues. If you could see the oil on your skin prior to that it would be super easy to clean off. Similarly, you could see it on your belongings and wash it off rather than getting repeat issues without knowing where you get it from.	terminalcomputer	t3_4tbdo4

One telescope could be installed on a 2 axis jig that fine tunes for consecutive write operations and another telescope could be installed fixed to the head for read operations. Since random read / write performance would be poor, a drive could be made with two swinging arms each containing a combination of telescopes in 2-axis jig or fixed configurations so that one telescope could always be writing while one is always reading. It would also be possible to achieve RAID 1 level read performance using only a single disk.	HonestRepairMan	t1_d5j45ar

t3_4tpod7	t1_d5jozos	1469031045	For me, it'll be a tough choice to purchase something without a headphone jack.   I have a lot of headphones and speakers I use regularly.   At work, at home, when I run, when I work out.   It's hard to find the right ergonomics in a head set, much less one that's wireless.   Plus, as long as Apple refuses to support a better codec than bluetooth's SBC or AAC (which no headset manufacturers support), I'm really unenthusiastic about the loss of audio quality.  I don't really want to replace all that just because my phone provider decided I needed to.   As much as it hurts because of invested app purchases, I'll probably won't buy a latest iphone or ipad for years if they go to no headphone jack.	Schnort	t1_d5jj5pt

t3_4tpod7	t1_d5jrwtk	1469034826	I mean, if you really think about it, if it becomes a hit, then headphone makers are going to eventually dump 3.5mm jacks for the new iPhone's and above, so once those makers make enough of them, it's going to be really cheap like 3.5mm headphones and earbuds	Daedaly	t1_d5jbhl0
t3_4tpod7	t1_d5jvaic	1469039081	The headphone jack is fragile enough.  I don't want a 2" lever arm on the 1/4" lightning plug that's inserted into my $700 phone.  It'll break something for sure, either itself or the receptacle.	Schnort	t1_d5jrhb2

t3_4tpod7	t1_d5k9a4o	1469057396	It's more than viable. It's better in a multitude of ways. Lightning has 8 pins that can be controlled/reprogrammed on-the-fly. So not only do you get digital sound... but you can lots of reconfigurable things that you cannot do with an analog-port. Not only that.. but it simplifies the internal design of the phone.. and closes a hole which improves waterproofing.	jmnugent	t1_d5k74i6

The *one* thing that'd be useful from it is being able to click on things if there is a bit of water/moisture on your screen and the heat register isn't working... and you can't do it!  The only thing that keeps me buying these silly phones is iTunes and having access to music, but I can find 99% of what I listen to on Spotify. Apple, I don't like you and don't need you anymore.

t3_4sy806	t1_d5lnxep	1469144770	&gt; remember the outburst when laptops started losing disc drives?  As a matter of fact, I don't. Because they kept making them. I did a search on Newegg and they have 3809 different models with them, and only 862 without.   But that really doesn't mean anything because your analogy isn't right. Optical media isn't obsolete; digital distribution has just made it irrelevant. Analog audio outputs on cell phones are neither obsolete (Sound itself is analog; it really can't go out of date), nor is it irrelevant - analog audio equipment is everywhere!  And just because this phone doesn't have a headphone jack doesn't mean that there won't still be phones with them.

t3_4tpod7	t1_d5mbitp	1469195398	5/5s/6se = Hands down best chassis design period. Plenty thin, but the square edges gave it attitude while making it easy to handle. While heavier, the weight is almost welcomed and compliments the hand well. If they made an identical chassis that accommodated a 4.7" screen it would have plenty of room inside of it for continued support and, IMO, become the best selling chassis in the line up.	_cooze_	t3_4tpod7
t3_4tpod7	t1_d5mbyhs	1469196078	&gt; power consumption is gonna be negatively impacted for sure.  Bluetooth LE has a power-usage range starting as low as 0.01 watts... up to 0.5 watts. I think you guys are dramatically hyperventilating over nothing. If you're using wireless BT headphones... you're going to run out of battery in the headphones way Way WAY **WAY** sooner than you will in the iPhone.   Not only that.... but the power-usage of Bluetooth is exponentially tinier than other things on the phone like WiFi-radios or Screen-ON time.

t3_4tpod7	t1_d5nl4u8	1469280303	Are your hands getting any smaller? Because phones are. The first iPhones were 12 mm thick, now they're down to 7, which is almost half. I don't remember anyone complaining that the early iPhones were unusable, quite the opposite, they were a big hit. To me a battery pack is the unusable solution. The whole point of a phone is that it's a self-contained unit. If I have to carry a second box with me and connect the two with a cable to top up every once in a while, well, that's just a load of silly hassle that I'd rather do without. If I'm going to be carrying a big battery with me, I'd rather it be integrated into the phone in the first place and do away with that hassle.	SordidDreams	t1_d5nkayl

t3_4tpod7	t1_d5nljdv	1469281279	As they get smaller they become easier to use. A thinner phone means  it's easier to reach around the whole thing and the way you get to the magical credit card thick phone is incrementally taking off a mm here and there.   The early iPhones were a lot smaller overall. I could use it with one hand. The early big Android phones were quite uncomfortable to hold.   The Note 1 was ridiculous because they weren't thin.   Also our brain normalizes what we have now.  The plus seemed huge, then I had it for a week and the 5s seemed like a doll phone. So doubling the thickness would probably cost a lot of in the store sales.   For me the battery pack works because it's a special occasion item. The 6s+ has only even come close to not making it through a full day when I was going somewhere special and playing Pokemon and just using it an insane amount. I don't always have it, but if I'm going on a trip it lets me not freak out about playing games.	andyster	t1_d5nl4u8
t3_4tpod7	t1_d5no3g2	1469286721	You mean the mechanical piece that ends up getting lose inside the phone and forces you to upgrade because cannot be repaired? Same shit with androids. Ever wonder why apple doesn't use the same connectors as on their MacBook? Then want you to upgrade all the time.	cmatechno	t1_d5ls1l1
t3_4tpod7	t1_d5nojyi	1469287591	Why on earth would anyone want a credit card-thick phone? That seems ridiculously impractical to me. The thin phones of today are already uncomfortable to hold. If I want to hold mine securely, I can't grip it by the edge because there barely is any. I have to wrap my fingers all the way around, and then they obscure part of the screen because there aren't any bezels either. If anything, I want phones to be thicker. 10 to 15 mm seems ideal to me.  I don't believe for a second that making a thick phone would lose sales, especially if you make it an optional extra. The number one concern people have with phones is battery life, and quite frankly I find the idea that it's okay for a phone to require charging every night to be ludicrous. We used to have phones that lasted *weeks* a decade or two ago. I want to go back to that. I want to go back to phones that are comfortable to hold and don't run out of juice after three seconds of use.	SordidDreams	t1_d5nljdv

t3_4tpod7	t1_d5nzw4u	1469307042	I really can't see how making it thicker ends up with a usable size especiallyonce you wrap it up in a case.   The plus size is already stretching my hands pretty far.   Back then when you charged tour phone every couple of days I barely used my phone for anything by modern standards. Nowadays my phone is unquestionably the most important thing I own.  It does more web and email type tasks, games plays most of my media etc. nightly charging seems like a small price to pay.	andyster	t1_d5nojyi

t3_4tpod7	t1_d5oy4gg	1469383148	Phones have been much thicker and were still perfectly usable.  The iphone reducing thickness has not made the phone more usable and easy to reach around, it's the opposite in fact where the phone keeps getting thinner and longer, therefore causing some users to be unable to reach their thumb diagonally across the entire screen.  This issue is caused by diagonal length, not thickness.	SociableSociopath	t1_d5nzw4u

t3_4tpod7	t1_d5pvsl9	1469449710	These aren't a 1 variable problem. A 3.5 inch iPhone could be several times thicker than a 5.5 inch iPhone because it was smaller in those dimensions. It's about total hand feel not just one thing   Thickness causes other issues because it doesn't sit as nicely in the hand which compounds problems with screen size. You can solve for the length issues in software relatively easily; I use reachability a lot just double tap and the top of iOS comes down.   But thickness combined with length makes it very difficult to hold a plus across the back over say a long phone call where the hold is a side to side grip. Also battery is heavy and the pinky shelf grip that is so ideal for one handed plus use becomes wholly untenable for much time.   Try to pinky shelf an iPad mini and the weight becomes quite a lot and if you doubled the thickness to fill with battery your weight would be in that range.	andyster	t1_d5oy4gg

Aldred was familiar with founder James Dyson’s legendary perfectionism, but even that didn’t prepare him for the task that lay ahead. For the next 18 years he worked this singular idea without a single commercial product release to show for his troubles."  Completely irrelevant to the discussion of the vacuum.  Unless you are priming the reader.  The article is 12 paragraphs long.  The first paragraph is irrelevant bullshit that has nothing to do with the vacuum.  The last one is basically praising how great the company is.  So, that is 2 paragraphs that have no purpose in a review for a product.  Lets see what else we can find.    The second paragraph is a bunch of tech speak to basically say that the reason the vacuum is so big, and therefore wont work if you own furniture of normal size, is because of how great the vacuum is at sucking, using the patented cyclone technology.  Its pure bullshit PR to cover for the fact that the vacuum looks like a minikeg.  3rd paragraph.  An actual review and comparison of the product with a similar product.  Where they explain the fact that it cant reach as much as the competition, but it vacuums much better in the areas in can reach.  Again, see 2nd paragraph for why.  4th - 10th paragraphs Filler with nothing to really add other than PR bullshit about how Dyson will improve the vacuum over time.  11th paragraph, the only one that really matters out of all of them, they come out and say "well, this cheaper vacuum is better in every way."

In headphone-land Bose is not great. If you just want great sound, major brands just as Sennheiser, Audio-Technica, AKG, and Beyerdynamic are great.

The thing with all-around bestness of items is that is that their perceived value/cost ratio is lower than a cheaper item's and the point is instead that their absolute value is better. You can't buy ten affordable cars and then say you're getting the better experience than with one Tesla.

My parents bought a dyson 4 tears ago, cheap and flimsy, already broken. I think they started making them less durable in order to sell them more often now.	Hershieboy	t1_d5symf1

t3_4uukoe	t1_d5vo3gh	1469782345	Bose made themselves relevant to modern consumers by simply making speakers small and convincing consumers that with enough bass and surround sound wizardry anything (Bose controlled demos) can sound good.  Truth is that it's crazy hard to make small speakers sound good, and consequently anything larger will just blow Bose away.  Add quality components and a great enclosure plus decent amp to the mix and Bose can't even begin to compete.	joergonix	t1_d5tlb82
t3_4uukoe	t1_d5vplkz	1469787549	I've been testing one for a few weeks – and it's better than any other robot vacuum cleaner I've seen before in terms of quality of the clean, usability etc... Not sure it quite justifies being that much more expensive than other products, though.	mccabeben	t3_4uukoe

t3_4uukoe	t1_d5wa5eo	1469819997	First, a robotic vacuum doesn't have to do a great job. What it's missing in suction is more than made up for by the fact that you can program it to come out several days a week while you're at work.   So even if it doesn't do a great job vacuuming my floors are much cleaner than if I had to rely on myself vacuuming maybe once a month.   So once you've got your robot vacuuming for you several times a week the dirtiest parts of your home are going to be the places it doesn't reach and those dirty spots become *really* annoying. So annoying that I won't purchase new furniture unless my Roomba fits under it. I even purchase new feet for a couch so that the Roomba could do it's thing. I don't think I could ever find furniture that the Dyson will fit under.	big_deal	t1_d5sxr0n

t3_4vrcmt	t1_d60susw	1470128596	Nexus devices usually use OLED displays. On OLED displays each pixel actually emits light (unlike LCD where there's a backlight that gets filtered).

t3_4vrcmt	t1_d60sv2h	1470128624	Correct me if I'm wrong please.

t3_4vrcmt	t1_d60v7r5	1470136456	I quite like it. I missed the pull up drawer from Eclair, so it's a nice throwback. I think it looks sleek.  I switched to iPhone a few months ago, but I still like Android. But since Lollipop not a lot has happened. It's stagnated. iPhone haters like to accuse Apple of not changing, but I went to Apple because I wanted a change. And updates. But with basic phones, getting a new phone meant learning a new phone, not more of the same. Four Android phones, ask that changed was basically the specs. It was still Android. Which is fine, Android is the best mobile OS IMO, but I got tired of it. iOS sometimes frustrates me, but it's still fresh, and though it's still a couple years behind, it gets some things right. Like updates.  If you, to, are getting tired of Android, even though you may think it's the best, don't be afraid to cross the street. It's not bad over here. It's not better but it's fine. Good, even.	dragontology	t3_4vrcmt

I have saved so much money buying games on PC that I could build a PC to beat the PS4/XBone with the savings. Better framerates, better graphics, more exclusives than the PS4/XB1 combined, etc.         I guess all I can say is that you can eat a dick buddy. You want to know what the internet is?

t3_4vsd36	t1_d62721w	1470208264	There is no increased resolution. The new xbox upscales to 4k just like the current xbox upscales most games to 1080p. And the games that get a "solid" frame rate use dynamic scaling to drop the resolution to keep the framerate. So when there is a lot going on it drop the res from "1080" to 460. Besides, there is VERY VERY few content that is even in 4K. You have to use the TVs internet like Netflix and there are 4 or 5 shows that in in 4k, YouTube videos are way compressed anyway so it isn't even really 4k, and forget about TV, it will be years before they go to 4K, besides some havent even gone to 1080p yet. Yes it will look better with the more dense pixles and the better color representation but unless you have a PC capable of handling 4K (with gtx 980ti and above with capable cpu) there is no point in getting a 4K tv, or a "4k" console. And all this is still not the best because none of this is TRUE 4K. Talk to me when consoles upscale to true 4k.	MinibirdPimpstrich	t1_d61f4wp

t3_4vsd36	t1_d63vf3a	1470317368	I think you have confused what I said. I am not buying the Xbox One S. I am buying a Scorpio when it is released. I don't believe that will have an internal power brick (could be wrong) but even if it does, they will have implemented a sufficient cooling system to handle it. Obviously I won't buy the first batch, rather I will wait for any hardware issues to be discovered. The Scorpio will absolutely have increased visuals over current hardware. And the blueray player will support 4k, unlike the 2 BLD players I currently own.	SpaceGoonie	t1_d6386ta
t3_4vz6ob	t1_d63yvjc	1470322345	I'm pretty sure 8K is like the max we can see. But honestly for me QHD is enough and 4K is astounding.	Qu33ph	t1_d63ryi4
t3_4vz6ob	t1_d64290j	1470326616	There is no "max" we can see. It's all relative to the size of the actual screen and, consequently, the distance you'll be watching from.  If you're gaming on a 55'' TV (don't), then 8K might not be enough for you not to be able to distinguish the pixelation, while if you're streaming to a mobile device like one of those fancy nvidia tablets (also don't), the screen is so small that 1440p is most likely enough.  It's like the framerate discussion: even though we can't distinguish individual frames when over 24 FPS, those additional frames smooth out the motion and lower the latency between your input and the response being shown in the monitor, which is especially important in high paced games	Kazzm8	t1_d63yvjc
t3_4vsd36	t1_d64fhjg	1470342835	Don't forget that it can output games and video in HDR now, which  people with some 4k tvs can appreciate even if the games aren't 4k.	THE_darkknight_pees	t1_d61ewlt
t3_4vsd36	t1_d64rk4x	1470360070	Please show me a computer for $300 that will do everything an Xbox S will do.  You can't so don't waste your time on google.  I build my stuff as well but I'm not an idiot.  Can you build a PC for 300 bucks, of course you can.  It will be a hunk of shit.     X99 $350 (old model for 200 or cheaper as you lose capability)  I5 $250 (i7 $350, yes old models can be cheaper I know)   As we can see building a PC with anything that is considered worth a gaming rig instantly tops any console ever.  We haven't even made it to GPU (add another $700 or $800) and god forbid you want to run SLI.     Now on the flip side why people paid for a Xbox s I'll never know.   Could have kept your x1, wait for Scorpio.  Buy a nvidia for home media set up, case closed.   Rookies.	Macnsal09	t1_d61kspp
t3_4vsd36	t1_d64rnf3	1470360208	After you update drivers and google why you have no audio. I'm a PC guy.  Don't be crazy. Consoles are a million times more simple then a PC.  That's a proven fact.   PC has a plus in almost everything.  Simplistic isn't it.	Macnsal09	t1_d61s4qg
t3_4vsd36	t1_d64rwrh	1470360615	Actually you are behind the times.  Who the fuck buys or use a blu-ray player?  Streaming is actually current gen technology.  Bluray players were like 2005 or 2006 technology	Macnsal09	t1_d6386ta

Rest of it is completely wrong. 4K content is everywhere. Every movie I watch is 4K.  Every show that's been produced since 4K, I watch in 4K. YouTube has legit 4K 60fps content.

t3_4vsd36	t1_d65bid4	1470404046	Anyone who wants the best picture and sound experience uses Blu-ray. Really, the best for sound is Lazer Disk. Streaming anything has something called compression rate. It must be compressed from original bit rate or resolution and has to travel then uncompress as it reaches your device. Compression and travel causes something called distortion!! But it's ok because you obviously don't care about the experience, grant it I do have Netflix and enjoy the convenience but that's all it is to me.  Also, 4K Blu-ray does exist. It is better in everyway to streaming in 4K and is being implemented more and more.	MinibirdPimpstrich	t1_d64rwrh
t3_4mysp6	t1_d65bio2	1470404060	The Dash does have 4gb memory, and is the preferred method as the Bluetooth streaming from the phone connection is spotty at best. Flossy did a recent review on gear iconx, and he was really impressed, "major major major go".	1n50mniac	t1_d3zexy3
t3_4vsd36	t1_d65d68y	1470406551	I never argued which is better or which has compression or bit rates.  Also I never said 4K blu-ray doesn't exist.  You made a comment saying blu-ray was this new great technology and people without it are behind the times.   I would greatly argue that people who still buy DVD, rent DVDs or need a blu-ray are behind the times.     I won't get into a debate about compression ratios. Sure bluray sounds great when you consider it next to someone with'a 7mb connection. Also blu ray bit rate is 40mps and usually coded and pressed at 25.  Sooo my internet which I adjust for, actually comes out way ahead of bluray as far as compression goes.  However I will agree bit rates and compression combined will always better on bluray.   Audio I will agree can be tricky and requires some work. 90% of everything I stream is 7.1 and the rest is 5.1.    Unless someone is a extreme home theater user (high end) I can agree bluray will provide an over all better expierence that can match going to the movies.  However for the other 99% people watching movies at home, streaming is perfect.  It's proven by the 20% jump in digital media and the 12% decrease in DVD/bluray sales.  Digital sales outsold physical media period by 20%.   Case and point convenience will always win. VHS beat laser disc, compressed audio files killed the CD and 4K bluray is dead before it even started.   So back to your original statement, bluray is behind the times regardless of which one provides the best quality.	Macnsal09	t1_d65bid4
t3_4vsd36	t1_d65e7d9	1470407971	Back to my original point. I never said Blu-ray was new. In fact I even said it was implemented in the PS3.  And everything else, just went off topic. I was just talking about not getting an Xbox just because of the Blu-ray.	MinibirdPimpstrich	t1_d65d68y
t3_4vsd36	t1_d65flim	1470409827	Gotcha. I was only talking about the comment I responded to, not everything said prior.  I do agree buying an Xbox for bluray is dumb.  Xbox s is a terrible buy for any reason.  Scorpio is right around the corner	Macnsal09	t1_d65e7d9
t3_4vz6ob	t1_d65ho21	1470412471	Developers. There are frameworks like OpenCL that let you perform computations on graphics cards.	veganmane	t1_d62x3oh
t3_4vsd36	t1_d65iht1	1470413518	Interesting,  let's double check some facts boyo. You seem to think you need a skylake i5 or i7 to beat the xb1 s. You could beat it with a few generations old i3 which are stupid cheap. And you can get a mobo for one of those for like 40 bucks. Xb1 is not a powerful machine by any means buddy. The pc you are trying to allude to needing is a monster that can run native 4k at least 60 for on high to ultra. The xb1 s will run games at 900p or 1080p (I believe I saw that it might try to simply upscale to 4k sometimes) at 30-40 fps on low to medium settings.      You also are talking about an 800 dollar graphics card? What card right now costs 800? A 1080 is cheaper than that and a new Titan X is way more but completely unnecessary for gaming and more for workstations. I will reiterate what I said earlier, you are an uninformed Internet stranger who doesn't know what he is talking about and I will be excusing myself from the conversation. Buh bye.

t3_4vz6ob	t1_d65pdh9	1470422155	That isn't true at all. You can purchase a Titan X from EVGA and other manufacturers. Some even offer all in one water cooling.	FigFrontflip	t1_d65nyrt
t3_4vz6ob	t1_d65rs02	1470425251	Is it? I'm sorry...looking it up you seem to be correct. There are no custom cards for the Titan X, however.	-Umbra-	t1_d65pdh9
t3_4vz6ob	t1_d65vnt7	1470430383	Not yet. Basically what NVIDIA does is they say "We're taking market control for two weeks" Then they give the schematics out and let EVGA and others have at it. That's when you'll start seeing the OC versions and such. IMO it's better to wait for those as they are usually a better deal and the water cooled ones are nice	FigFrontflip	t1_d65rs02
t3_4vsd36	t1_d65wsml	1470431997	Correct. The new xboxes have 4K 60 FPS (reportedly I've seen no benchmarks) You are not going to hit 4K 60fps with an i3 on most intense games. Battlefield, GTA, and others all bottle neck on a 980.  So that's been proven an i3 will not compare.  1080s are going for $700.  So that's respectably in the window I quoted.   So once again what else you got?  Also stick with the topic.  What 300 dollar computer will compare to the Xbox s.   Don't even respond with an i3 running a 980. The rig you keep trying to say is 300 bucks won't even run current games worth a shit, much less games that are being produced for Xboxs or Scorpio.   I5 will do the job but we already seen that price.    Buy bye.	Macnsal09	t1_d65iht1

t3_4vsd36	t1_d66b3y3	1470455351	I will say this on last thing and them I am for real finished. THE XBOX ONE S DOES NOT PLAY GAMES AT 4K NOR AT 60 FPS. THE XBOX ONE PLAYS GAMES AT 900P-1080P 30FPS WITH LOW TO MEDIUM SETTINGS. THE ONE S IS A 10% FPS BOOST AND POSSIBLY **UPSCALING** (AKA NOT ACTUALLY NATIVE OR GOOD LOOKING) TO 4K WITH STILL LOW TO MEDIUM SETTINGS. AT THOSE SETTINGS, A 980 WOULD BE WAYYY OVERBOARD.

Kind of how you are doing.  Then I pulled it back to the Xbox s to stay on subject.  Try and keep up.  So you think a 980 on an i3 is going to push 4K.  Lol.  You call me a peasant? 😂😂😂 what's funny is you have yet to tell me what computer for 300 bucks will do the same thing as an Xbox s.  You can't just say you were wrong.   It's okay I understand.  You probably got your computer from geek squad, Best Buy.  Read some articles about how other nerds liked it and what needs to upgraded.  Soon you realized you got a hunk of shit and need $1500 for a really good gaming rig. However mommy and daddy won't buy it for you. You got sad because you wasted money and questioned wether you should have gotten a console. You  Read an article saying 300 bucks for a computer will out do any console as an attempt to justify a master race and feel better. However you have no clue what the article said so you avoid the conversation to avoid looking like a noob.  We all get it.  We've seen it a million times.

All I can respond with is something like trolololololololololol because that is the level of kindergarten shit I am seeing. https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide there is a build in there that will beat a normal xb1 or an xb1s. Read through my posts. I built my first comp at 15 and was selling custom builds in high school. You are too fucking stupid to even realize that the xb1s is not really any better than the normal xb1 in terms of specs. OMFG this is too funny.

t3_4vsd36	t1_d66u35p	1470503700	We will address your comments backwards.  First I told you I'm a PC gamer but I'm also not an idiot thinking a $300 PC compares.  The fact alone you had to goto a Reddit called PC master race is pathetic all in its own.  If you knew shit about builds you would know that build will not keep up.    Second: Your x4 with a 750 is going to blow balls.  If you play Tetris or another GPU dependent  game, your fine.  Play a new game and tell me how it works.  Next the requirement was for a $300 PC that compares.  You went and cited someone else's build and still busted budget and you're not even close to being done.  I'll exclude monitor because I know your going to say something about a tv.  We both know PC gamers don't play on a TV so you need a monitor.    You still need a OS, power supply, speakers, keyboard, mouse, and a few other things.  So again you lose.  I win. Just give up kid.  It's not possible to build a $300 gaming PC that will compete with Xbox s.   Go back to Reddit.   I look forward to your highly educated response. /S	Macnsal09	t1_d66ql1l

t3_4vsd36	t1_d696xq6	1470674835	I completely disagree that I am behind the times. I already have Netflix for streaming, which I use frequently. However for the best quality picture and sound on my current hardware Bluray is my best bet. If I want to watch something I own that is also available on Netflix, I will put the disk in for the best quality picture and sound. Some of this is because I have limited bandwidth due to my geographical location. I am excited for 4k movies and the amazing surround sound that will support them. Your argument fails to take into consideration the immense variety of hardware configurations, human preferences, internet services, and personal economic situations. Millions of people still use basic DVD players because they didn't see a need or have the ability to upgrade to HD and Bluray. You saying they are "behind the time" is insensitive and ignorant.

My point was simply that you shouldn't label people as being "behind the times" without giving some consideration first. It was opinionated and inclusive of millions of people who aren't early adopters or cord cutters, or whose circumstances don't match your own. I still think you spoke in ignorance (both times).

t3_4vsd36	t1_d6cknjz	1470874311	Automatic driver updates if you so wish, and issues like having no audio are very rare. If they do occur, the solution is generally pretty simple and the application probably just needs to be run in some sort of compatibility mode. Once an issue has been troubleshooted (we're talking standard issues, nothing like modding bethesda games) it most likely will never pop up again.	throwthisawayacc	t1_d64rnf3
t3_4vsd36	t1_d6ckr9h	1470874462	With an SSD, a PC can go from off to in-game faster than a console too, and it has a handicap since the consoles (IIRC) are always on, but in sleep mode when not in use.	throwthisawayacc	t1_d61s4qg

Obviously he wasn't trying to say that an i3 can pair up with a 980, and the 980 is still pretty expensive compared to newer cards that match or outperform it at equal or lesser prices so mentioning it at all doesn't even make any sense.      You could throw together an i3 and a 750ti or an RX 460 and have something that matches the performance of the xbox one s and beats it in the cases of more cpu intense games. And that's not even factoring in overclocking the gpu, whereas the consoles out now have mid-range gpus from 2012, underclocked.      Let's not even factor in the cost of xbox live or the fact that xbox games on average cost more than PC games, without even considering websites that sell keys for cheap. These factors exacerbate the savings you get from PC every year after you've made the purchase.	throwthisawayacc	t1_d66l1q5
t3_4vsd36	t1_d6cndxj	1470878525	I actually didn't jump back and forth. Follow the conversation and you will see I only jumped to counter his argument when he left the main topic.  Also I fully awknoledged that gpu he mentioned are perfectly fine just not with an i3.  It's proven ready when you run an i3 with those gpu, it's a troubled set up for new games. People are running the i3 set up at low to medium settings just to get a decent refresh or frames. It's nothing personal or a way to try to win the argument.  Newer games just require more CPU power/ GPU power ratio.  The argument was getting a full PC set up for 300 bucks that matches what Xbox s will do.  And for 300 bucks it's just not going to happen.  I also never argued that games were cheaper or more expensive.  Anyone can research and find this to be a plausible factor.	Macnsal09	t1_d6cli09
t3_4vsd36	t1_d6cnh4j	1470878664	Agreed it's simple once you have done it a time or two.  However fact remains consoles are designed as Uplp in general.  PCs try to be and generally are easy but they are not as easy as consoles.  Never have been and never will be ( which turns out to offer more benefits then downfalls).	Macnsal09	t1_d6cknjz

t3_4vxc1u	t1_d6d4q4m	1470918287	It's just so they can lower the price of the original Xbox one and fanboys will buy the new one cause they like shiny things all they are doing is trying to get there numbers to match sonys,they could have released this console first with 4K but no it's much easier to make a shiter version first wait a while, than bring out a new one and they will continue to do this because most gamers don't have a clue it's all about having the best they just leak it slowly over the first 2 to 4 years of a consoles life span	Hephaestus3131	t1_d629t50
t3_4vxc1u	t1_d6d4ss8	1470918440	Or because the Scorpio is going to most likely use AMD 470/480 based APU which AMD doesn't have yet and the 470/480 are in  short supply, far too short to reasonable support a major launch for atleast a month.

t3_4wb3zu	t1_d6erahv	1471021234	I own one of these, it really doesn't need to be recharged often. Have to remember a room isn't typically that large when you account for furniture.   Have a 2200 sq ft home, 2 floors so really about 1100 upstairs. It can do my kitchen, dining room, and living room in one go. Then I have it do the bathroom and two bedrooms, then take it downstairs to my (large) laundry room/entryway on a 2nd charge.  ~3 minutes worth of setup time total to mop my entire house, it doesn't take more than a few seconds to fill and the pads literally just slide on and release right into the trash. First charge should be ready from the get-go because you should have had it on charge from the last time it finished. So only subsequent charges would cause any delay.  It also does more than mop (damp and dry sweeping - the dry sweeper catches *everything*) which is helpful for our dogs that shed like crazy.  Does it replace actual mopping? No. It is effective though and you'll find your floors stay cleaner longer and you'll need to mop much less frequently.	TwistedMexi	t1_d69cfvn
t3_4wb3zu	t1_d6erhiz	1471021463	If you can mop your whole house and get your car up on a ramp, change your oil, and clean up your tools in 15 minutes, then buddy - you should open up a Mechanic&amp;Maid service.	TwistedMexi	t1_d68hxi7

t3_4yacx3	t1_d6maatu	1471500783	If I had a dollar for every time I thought a news source had been paid recently by Samsung, I would be a tech writer.  They are excellent at marketing, truly a company that knows how to do business, but innovative is something they are not.  They can produce an appealing phone, but really that is just a way of saying they have a design department not consisting of morons. All phones are just the sum of their parts, and all of them are messing up good components with awful software. They happen to have a good panel manufacturing business.  Ironically the most innovative phones are the ones saying "you don't need everything" IMO. This is just more banging on about how much you need more.  Sharp deserve credit for the 507sh android one phone, with its terrible camera, which never had thermal throttling, and could navigate for 3 hours and lose only 30% charge, going on to last more than the rest of the day, and Sony, for producing a critically panned phone who's principle innovation is a battery isn't battered by poor charging optimisation over time (over their life they last longer, just not when they are a day old in the hands of reviewers).  A flashy screen is just silly.	thirdtimesacharmer	t3_4yacx3

t3_4y43hg	t1_d6mih1f	1471524554	I have a D3200 with the 18-55mm kit lens, a 55-300mm zoom lens, and a 50mm prime.   Between 50mm and 35mm, I'd say the 50 is better if you do a lot of portraits or shots with single or few subjects, while the 35 is better if you like to take shots of landscapes &amp; nature or shots with more than a few people. The 50 will also give you slightly better (more blurred) bokeh, since it's a higher focal length.   Between you and me though, my 55-300mm is the star amongst the lenses I own; I got it on sale for around the same price as a 50mm prime, but I've taken some pretty amazing shots with it.

t3_4yacx3	t1_d6mycwq	1471545437	I did have to switch out my original m8 after two months but only because the plastic bit that forms the speaker grille wouldn't stay glued down in one corner. They were happy to oblige. And I kinda wore a thin spot in the oleophobic coating playing Marvel Contest of Champions.  But I'm more talking about the ability of it to not become a hindrance as the software advances. First smartphone that's done that. The rest either ended up stuffed to the gills because of limited capacity and/or couldn't get out of their own way just opening apps. So I replaced them right on the 2-year mark, if not sooner.

t3_4y4i8z	t1_d6sqsr0	1471919665	HP makes even more in gross per-unit profit after various considerations made in b2b deals. For example, AMD may cut HP a deal for 100k RX480 cards at $100 / ea which makes the margins even sweeter (it's not like Sony and Microsoft are paying full retail for what's in their consoles). However, because the cards at retail for, for example, the GTX 1080 founder's edition are locked up by them, there's no real deal that can be made to incentivize the system integrator enough.  I view these kinds of systems more like how supermarkets work - the vendors are paying rent to be on the shelves, the grocer is just there as floor space to be rented out.	djk29a_	t1_d6n609m

Since 90's it has been the only choice for engineers, astronauts, developers, chem/bio labs, medicine and military.    You go to any top league industry/company and all you will see is Thinkpads everywhere. Go to Tesla, Oracle, Microsoft, Volksvagen Group, NASA, ESA, CERN etc.. even the default choice for ISS (space station).  Out of some 100 developers in our company only 7 use Apple excluding designers which all for some reason use Apple PCs. But walk into any of the largest companies or top research centers/universities you will see what I mean.    On top of the Ideapad bloatware/spyware crap they pull lots of these little moves while Thinkpad family receives little focus. Talk about not knowing where your worth is.	deliosenvy	t3_4z4sub

t3_4yhavl	t1_d6v7fa7	1472073365	Too little too late for Blackberry. This is what happens to a company whose management screams "stay the course" while the world changes around it.   It's painfully clear because of the past  corporate appeal of Blackberry products,  the board at Blackberry is not at all in tune with *technology*,  they are in tune with *business*.   This is a problem however when your business *is* technology.   This underwhelming Alcatel phone with BB branding and mild Blackberry OS flavors overlaid on Android should have been released in 2011 when Blackberry actually had a respectable market share and chance at life.   The *only* thing this phone achieves is so they have something to show investors,  "look! We've adapted! We're committed to an android phone! This is where the trend is going!" and they can survive a couple more months of awkward board meetings.   Well congratulations Blackberry, you've done what you've should've done 5 or 6 years ago, which is an *eternity* in the tech industry. Die slow you disconnected fucks, no one will miss you.

But the fact remains,  and anything RIM does now is just to slow the burn,  retain any market value they can for when their investors inevitably come cashing in,  and try to stay relevant enough to be bought by someone,  most likely Microsoft.   Rome didn't fall overnight. Neither do fortune 500 companies.   The smartphone market is already crowded,  and RIM is damaged goods. Like I said,  if they had adopted Android 6 years ago,  partnered with Microsoft, or provided a favorable marketplace for app devs to want to develop for them, they would be in a decent place right now with a nice little market share carved out in the corporate world still.   The fact is,  there is too much ground to make up now. Their execs can probably see this now, but again, it's too late. Shoulda woulda coulda.	RationalLies	t1_d6vt8dg

It's just a matter of time. They have zero market share now,  and after 6 years of twiddling their thumbs and slapping BB logos on oem unimpressive hardware, they have gained zero traction.   I don't want them to fail necessarily, but it's inevitable. They will be bought out and someone else will try to save the name,  but it's going to be an uphill battle after the hole they've dug.

However, the MK2 brought a revolution in DSLR video, that provided a large market to amateurs and professionals, alike.  The expectations from Canon, were reflected from that impact.

t3_4zt337	t1_d6ysgt5	1472306633	I have had the **exact** same problem RE:SD card, but with the T3 model. Unfortunately mine started with every couple of days and then turned into consistently, the SD card would automatically eject itself every time I tried to put it back in. I had also not had mine a full year.  I also had sporadic issues with the screen freezing for up to hours at a time and being able to nothing to stop it (the usual turn it off and on again being disabled by the freeze!).  As the freezing was sporadic, whilst not welcomed, I could deal with this. But with no SD card, and having filled internal storage, I could not install any further apps (without uninstalling others), take photos and it really affected the entire performance.  Luckily I did not buy mine direct, but rather through a retailer and so was protected by a warranty and got a refund.  It was a real shame as I loved the Xperia series and this was the third variant in the series I had purchased but memory card usage is a really basic feature these days, coupled with the sporadic freezing it was time to say goodbye.

We had a group and there was a second group we had never met in the room as well. We all had to work together. We did the hardest one and it was a 2 hour experience and we got out with 4 seconds to spare. It was so intense.  At the end, the host informed us we completed the room that only 3.5% of groups that participated actually completed. It was absolutely crazy!   Highly recommended. We all got a free alcoholic drink of our choice after the room was finished as a reward. So worth.	ZachsSmirkingRevenge	t1_d6z9ltv
t3_4zt337	t1_d70elnc	1472419262	I work in the industry managing a phone retail outlet - we've had very few come back for repair considering how many we've sold.  I can say for certainty that your experience is not limited to the Sony devices. Every phone has the potential to do the same thing, and the service centres don't really care how it happened, they can only see that it has.  You probably didn't do anything, but again, the manufacturer is only obligated to cover you for the initial year. I've had people denied repairs a day outside of warranty.  It sucks, but unfortunately it's just the reality of having a phone these days - a small percentage (very small) will experience defects, no matter the make or model.	one21gigawatts	t3_4zt337

It was a real shame because it was my first Sony mobile device and I wanted to like it. I actually would have preferred that they fixed it but they failed me all around.

t3_4zt337	t1_d714iv4	1472474964	I can attest to this lack of build quality on Sony mobiles.   My Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet has also been receiving mysterious issues that I haven't been able to find an answer for. My touchscreen cannot register movements properly anymore, especially on the bottom right corner of my screen. Whenever I try to slide downward (usually in the YouTube app to pick a "related video"), more often than not the tablet thinks I've lifted my finger and pressed down again, leading me to click on something I didn't mean to click on. Other times, I tap one area, and the tablet thinks I've pressed another area - or worse, completely spazzes out and goes off pressing several areas in a row without my fingers touching the screen. I've scrubbed the glass again and again, but the problem persists, so I don't know of any possible fix.	nervouswreck96	t3_4zt337

t3_503syf	t1_d71zknb	1472518031	Ok. I am 50% here to ask for some advice, and am 50% here to vent my frustration.   I recently purchased a seriously cool speaker, the UE Roll. (I know, I am a peasant, unlike the lords of Boom) This speaker is freaking awesome, and I am definitely stoked to have this thing hanging around.  HOWEVER, if you purchase this through the [official website](http://www.ultimateears.com/en-au/ueroll), this product comes with a sweet ass floatie, that the little sucker and chill on in the pool. Now, being the 3 times a year pool goer that I am, obviously I am hell bent and getting my sweaty hands on this inflatable fun.   First, I check the usual spots in order of preference: Amazon, Official website, ebay, and finally the hail mary of craigslist. No dice.  I break down and contact the support line of UE, and explain my situation. I am cheesin for a floatie, and am willing to trade for just about anything. (but for legal reasons, only mentioned money)  Their response? I will paraphrase, "Get recked m8".   Apparently, you can only get one of these suckers if you buy it on the official site, and they horde these fuckers in a warehouse somewhere like they're god damn WW2 rations.   Anyways. So if anyone knows how I can get one, point me in the right direction. If not, whatever. I will tie that shit to the lid of a styrofoam cooler like a true Reddit life pro tip post would have me do.	patriche	t3_503syf

The GPS is really crappy it's choppy, sometimes decides to stop working for a solid 10-20 second (enough to miss my stop) and the screen sometimes gets so hot that the screen protector melted at some point.

If you're on Sprint or Verizon, you have a lot fewer choices.   &gt; user replaceable battery  This seems to me the main sticking point. It looks like the [ASUS Zenfone 2 Laser](https://www.asus.com/Phone/ZenFone-2-Laser-ZE500KL/) is the only phone that checks all those boxes.   If you're wiling to give up the removable battery, you've got better options like the ever-popular [Samsung Galaxy S7](http://www.samsung.com/us/explore/galaxy-s7-features-and-specs/) and the [Sony Xperia X Peformance](http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/phones/xperia-x-performance/).   If you want a truly small Android phone, the [Sony Xperia Z5 Compact](http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/phones/xperia-z5-compact/) is basically your only option.

For a power bank, I use a Pisen 5000mAh thing that I got for free from a relative's hospital. (Employee benefits, I guess.) It's $16 [here](https://www.amazon.com/Pisen-5000mAh-Foldable-iPhone-Samsung/dp/B0188FHCS6) and also plugs directly into the wall, which is cool.  I don't use either a whole lot, but they're great.

t3_503syf	t1_d74l5po	1472679952	The WiFi on Kindles can be disabled you know. And no they're not gonna turn it back on behind your back to submit data. You can even keep your Kindle updated and load books onto it without *ever* enabling the WiFi, at least that is the case for my 1st gen Paperwhite that hasn't had WiFi enabled in over a year.  The fact that it can't read epubs natively is annoying but converting eBooks to other formats like .mobi is rather trivial.  Also it *can* read pdfs but be warned that pdfs aren't gonna work very well on most eReaders because they're not powerful enough to correctly render many pdfs and there may be issues with the formatting being suboptimal for the device's screen size.  I'm not saying you need to go with a Kindle, but you won't be tied to Amazon if you do. If anything you're losing them money since Kindles are sold at or below cost.	FluorineWizard	t1_d72dypm

That being said, I think that most people realize that having their notes digitized this way doesn't offer many real-world benefits over using a scanner or a good camera. The only real benefit I see is that artists can draw and it will give actual paper-and-pen tactile response. I'm worried about finding ink refills for it, though.	AkirIkasu	t3_50mcsm

If you shoot a lot in burst you will quickly reach the 300. Then you might miss great shoots because of the extra time you spend replacing batteries.	Microham	t1_d6xhq87

t3_4zh2be	t1_d763i12	1472773672	Actually not. Sony is way ahead of Canon here:  http://ilovehatephoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ISO-Test.jpg  https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sony_a7rII_vs_canon_5ds_high_iso_test_100_crop.png (left A7S and right 5D Miii)  I don't even think they are even competing here.  The 5D is a workhorse and a tank. It speaks to journalists, sport photographers, wildlife photographers, fashion photographers etc. Everywhere where you need to shoot quick and long.    The Sony cameras are light, have less noise and are way slower than Canon's top cameras. With that they speak more to photographers who are into street photography, landscapes, night photography, portraits etc.	Microham	t1_d6zkpjw

Everything is as I liked it on the m8 but with most of the 2016 flagship specs and features.   Biggest Pro: Hi resolution audio jack, dude to dedicated builty in DAC.  Con: Not Waterproof I guess and Camera inferior to the s7 edge. But the camera is still great imo.  If i recall correctly there's £100 or $100 off on the HTC website atm for the 10.

t3_503syf	t1_d779i2g	1472850101	I can't personally recommend any as I don't live in the US but it's worth just researching custom laptop makers in your area and seeing how reputable they are according to reviewers.  If budget isn't an issue I guess you could always go MSI,  I hear that's a brand you can't really go wrong with,  for gaming laptops.  The reason for going custom for a gaming laptop  is that they're normally cheaper than branded premade gaming laptops and you can cut out features you don't need,  thereby decreasing costs.

t3_503syf	t1_d77dgmv	1472856447	As far as Western mainstream manufacturers go, I don't see any tablets with them.

t3_503syf	t1_d77g78w	1472861240	There are lots of rumors going around that the iPhone 7 won't have a 3.5mm headphone jack, meaning you'll have to buy a lightning-to-3.5mm adapter to use headphones, or get a pair of lightning-port headphones. If those rumors are true, I'd stay away from the iPhone 7. However, if you don't really use your headphones with your phone, then it probably won't be a big issue.  As far as the Note 7 goes, it's among the best phones on the market today. However, Samsung's been having some QA issues with them, as they're currently recalling the Note 7 worldwide because of reports that their batteries are exploding. So I'd steer clear of the Note 7 for a little while, at least until they've sorted that out.   Google's got a couple of new phones coming out soon as well.

t3_503syf	t1_d77zd5i	1472911841	I am planning to buy a laptop for school and would like to know how big of a deal the screen finish of the laptop? There are very few gaming laptops with glossy screen and the one I plan on buying is the HP Omen 15 (2015) model. The other matte screen laptop I'm considering is the Asus ROG GL502VT. Specs wise ROG beats the Omen but for a regular school work both are good. I am not sure about their processor capabilities. One uses i7 4k and other i7 6k. Another thing is that Omen is a bit old and if something breaks, I don't know if it'll get repaired or replaced. HP has stopped selling it on its site and is only available on Bestbuy.ca.  My uses:  I do play games but not that much. Like 2-3 hours max in a week during school weeks but I tend to watch movies a lot and for this reason I wish to know which laptop will be a good one. I am currently using Dell XPS 15z and it had a glossy LED screen but had to replace it with a cheap matte screen as the laptop slipped from my hand and the screen broke. The color quality/viewing experience was very good when watching movies with the earlier glossy screen. With this Chinese matte screen, it is really not that great. I really don't know if I am giving too much importance to the glossy screen. Also, do you guys know any other glossy laptops that I could look into? Let me know what your thoughts are on this.  Thanks	gauz47	t3_503syf

t3_50yzol	t1_d7824gz	1472916934	I have to disagree. Mine were riddled with wireless audio artifacts that were immensely distracting for me. Eventually I just trashed them honestly. I got them on a good sale though and got some enjoyment out of them, but I wouldn't say they're worth it. I'd recommend wired headphones unless wireless is an absolute must, and ideally has aptX like these. I think I might save up for these because wireless is very convenient.	SunJR	t1_d781jat

To me it seems like it flip flops as time goes on between headphones and hi fi home systems.  I personally love me some 7 channel home theater and cant for the life of me get into headphones. There is nothing like a system that vibrates your internal organs when you listen to music or causes a bowl movement when explosions happen in a movie. Headphones just cant do that. I wont lie I tried a pair on Senns a year ago and I was kind of impressed.	Eyepoopedmaself	t3_50yzol

Even in bluetooth headphones there is still a DAC, and the DAC on some pair of headphones might not be better than the DAC on a phone/laptop/stereo/etc. With digital audio files regardless of where they converted to analog they are still going to be converted to analog at some point. Phones/laptops/stereos also tend to have a larger battery, which means they can drive a better DAC than the battery inside some bluetooth headphones.   That said, wireless has its benefits and sometimes a hit in audio quality is fine. I might pick these up. I picked up some HK BT headphones that were pretty alright, but still sounded better driven by external sources. Ended up just giving them to a friend who had his pair stolen though. I have some Beyers for home listening and earbuds for traveling.	mattindustries	t1_d7827n0

t3_50yzol	t1_d7847j3	1472920372	I get what you mean, but I would disagree that the DAC in a phone would be better than one in a decent set of wireless headphones.   When I got my momentums I gave them a go using the headphones cable and the quality is far superior through Bluetooth than it is wired. It just lacked oomph and clarity. That was also being driven by an old X-Fi and Tidal.   I haven't had a chance to hook them to my record player yet though which will be interesting.	wdb94	t1_d783q8g
t3_50yzol	t1_d784br0	1472920571	I have Bose QC35s. While the sound is more than competent--much better than past efforts--you buy them for the best of class noise cancelling and the sound is a "best effort" feature. B&amp;W will almost certainly have a better sound profile, but no noise cancelling.	geoelectric	t1_d78473d
t3_50yzol	t1_d784bug	1472920575	I don't have this brand but I'm indifferent towards my big headset being wireless.  The range limitation keeps me within 20 feet before I hear, "..disconnected.." and I couldn't find a better reason to not have wired set other than I simply didn't want the cord dangling from my left ear cup.  Other than that, slightly on the pointless side.  If you had to have this brand, I'd save the $50-75 and get the wired set.  Now, if someone wants to put out a decent set of wireless earbuds that don't look and feel ridiculous, just tell me how much.	TalibanBaconCompany	t3_50yzol
t3_50yzol	t1_d784hox	1472920843	I bought a pair of g930s last November. They have been a relentless pain in my ass. They lose connection to my PC five to thirty times a day, when sitting 30 inches from the transmitter. They also get pretty bad sound distortion sometimes. I constantly think about trying to warranty them. Maybe I have a bad transmitter.	Crintor	t1_d781jat
t3_50yzol	t1_d784nlu	1472921102	I have had my P7'S for around 2 years now, I don't have anything negative to say about them to be honest. They sound great the build quality is much better than anything I have had before, they just feel like they will last longer than I will.  In the time I have had the P7's I have gone through 2 sets of sony headphones for around £80 each to use in the office and they just don't last or sound anywhere near as good. So I think they are really worth the money long term.  I would recommend buying extra cables though, they are detachable but have a bent connector on one end, you don't want to find yourself with no available cables in 10 years time. I bough a longer 5m cable to use at home.	jonmh85	t3_50yzol
t3_50yzol	t1_d784o8k	1472921129	The older pair of wireless Sennheisers I have transmit audio losslessly to the headphones, and the audio quality is up there with a set of HD8xx headphones.

Blows the P7s out of the water, and they're planar magnetic, too. The level of precision is superb.	NotAnotherNekopan	t1_d78123s
t3_50yzol	t1_d785k6w	1472922521	For a second there I thought you were talking about being a "Barbiturates &amp; Weed" dealer. All the signs were there, you listed your stock of what I could only assume were street names. Then you even critiqued the shape of the buds and I lost it.  I couldn't decide if you were a cool parent or a really bad one.   On a side note, I think people underestimate the noticeable quality of a good headphone. Although, I think wireless  technology hasn't had the time to perfect the ability to send the data fast enough to match wired ones. Bluetooth just isn't there yet so the price is mostly for all the added processing the headphone has to do. Perhaps, it would be better if they did wifi direct headphones.	CaptainBlues	t1_d784xu4

t3_50yzol	t1_d785tfe	1472922925	I believe headphones have gained a lot of popularity because of younger people. To truly take advantage of a good stereo, you need a room of a good size that allows the speakers to be placed where they sound best, room treatments and traps, and you need to live in a house or an apartment with crazy thick walls.  Younger people often don't have a ton of space, and are often living in a dorm or in a lower end (thin walled) apartment in a city. They also are likely moving every year or two, and lugging around a stereo with room treatments is a pain.  Headphones are also often portable, which is in line with the popularity of listening to music on the go among younger people.  Lastly, headphones provide those small details and spacial awareness elements that are needed for many multiplayer shooters.  Basically, headphones are much more compatible with the lives and lifestyles of young people.	totallywontstabyou	t1_d782yyd
t3_50yzol	t1_d785un9	1472922977	Anyone know if these are good for music production? They aren't noise cancelling and I hear that's pretty important.	waveofblue	t3_50yzol

t3_50yzol	t1_d78651v	1472923441	I'll temper that by saying Bose's customer service is pretty baller, particularly if you buy from one of their stores. I had minor creaks in my QC35s and they swapped them over the counter a month in no questions--indicated they would have done so for any reason up to 90 days in (or refunded within 30). They have a 50% credit trade up program for broken out of warranty phones, etc.   They're certainly not up to V-moda or Master &amp; Dynamics level of metal-dominant construction but overall they've hit better build quality (and service) than my Sonys and Sennheisers where I feel they more directly compete. Plastic headphones all have similar QC issues for the most part.   All said, though, Bose anything vs. P7 or similar is like comparing a nice plush Lexus with a slightly quirky BMW--both good at what they do, but one optimized for set and forget comfort and the other for character and performance. It's not really a direct competition.	geoelectric	t1_d784wgh
t3_50yzol	t1_d7866t7	1472923518	The thing is for the money it's hard to beat a very good pair of headphones with speakers.  Also some of us are stuck in apartments and/or have family members to consider so no insane music/sound levels outside of headphones.

t3_50yzol	t1_d786k25	1472924103	Oppos should be fine without one. Mad dogs are better with one. Magni/modi combo is around $200 and they can drive them well. The o2/odac is around $150 on sale and they'll also do the job.	Vallenium	t1_d786deu
t3_50yzol	t1_d786n7l	1472924241	B&amp;W p7 will beat on sound. Bose is only good for noise cancelling. Otherwise they're mediocre. At the price range though there's also master and dynamics, oppo, sennheiser momentums and a bunch else.	Vallenium	t1_d78473d

t3_503syf	t1_d786sxh	1472924496	#Internet over the power lines. Does it actually transmit through the power cabling or are they simply wireless linkers?  I frequently move house and often require better internet connection in the upper floors. I usually have to drape massive ethernet wires to a router that I use as a second wifi hotspot however I am fed up of doing this when I move house.  I have seen these internet over the power line adapters and do not understand how they would work technically with the three household wires (positive, negative, and ground). I can only think that they are actually wireless communicators which talk to each other and spit out an ethernet signal. So essentially they are a wireless ethernet cable. Is this correct or do they in face work through the power cabling?

t3_50yzol	t1_d788n7u	1472927488	I agree with you in that instance. But do you not use a protective case for them? I bring mine everywhere I go, but I'm very, every careful to always pack them up when not being used.

t3_50yzol	t1_d788qc6	1472927624	If you haven't auditioned the 35s you should take a shot next time you're at a mall with a store. They aren't far off from my MDR-1ABTs for sound quality and they're quite a bit more comfortable.   The main problem with Bose has always been the artificial-sounding DSP vs. natural analog sound, but that distinction disappears for wireless--they're all DAC/DSPed by nature of the tech.  Bose has also found a smoother almost Momentumish sound profile lately and doesn't sound as artificial now. I get a touch of sibilance at the top of the treble and a touch of boominess at mid-bass and otherwise it's pretty solid. Even that has lessened with break-in.   I'd put them in the above average bucket now, allowing for a 50-100 price premium for easy storefront service and the excellent noise cancellation. They've come quite a ways.   Edit: I generally would agree with [this comparison of QC35 and M2](http://newatlas.com/bose-qc-35-review-vs-sennheiser-momentum-wireless/43684/).	geoelectric	t1_d786n7l

Samsung's QA should have caught this months ago. Those batteries have Samsung's logo on them, they're sold by Samsung, and they go into Samsung devices exclusively. Samsung is responsible for them. Samsung seems to agree, judging by how they're handling this.  I mean, I'm not down on Samsung, my last 3 phones have been Samsung and so far I'm impressed with how they're handling this, but to say that they have *no* responsibility is asinine.

At most, I'd now pay no more than $150 CAD for them, probably less. If you have the money, I'd recommend looking at other options.   What other options you should look at depends on how you like to listen to your music and what kinds of headphones you think you'd be comfortable with - open/closed back, in-ear/on-ear/over-ear, etc. There are lots of different kinds to look into.

t3_503syf	t1_d78ngq6	1472952894	In case you don't know what rooting is (skip this paragraph if you do know), it essentially gives you, the user, the ability to change, edit, and/or remove any file on the phone, even files that might be needed for the phone to run properly.    The process of rooting can brick (break) your phone if not done right, so I don't recommend doing it unless you know what you're doing, or you have someone who does. Also, as a general guideline, 1-tap rooting programs (like Kango) that run directly on your phone are usually avoided if possible, as you don't know exactly what they're doing under the hood; when rooting, it's recommended that you do the process yourself, so you know what's going on.

But PC gaming is finally moving towards more mobile form factors with the new 10xx generation desktop grade mobile GPUs, and laptops are meant to be taken outdoors and to other people who are not gamerz.  It is time some manufacturer acknowledges this and develops a gaming laptop that is actually acceptable to use in public.  Size and weight don't matter that much. A 1080 and its cooling solution is always going to be heavy, that's the tradeoff you make when you buy it. But IBM used to make heavy duty bricks with similar dimensions that didn't look like the owner faps to Fast and Furious.	EnaiSiaion	t1_d78bse2
t3_50x9yk	t1_d78zqpa	1472986476	Whenever a manufacturer attempts to make a thinner or lighter laptop than their usual fare, it will be compared to a MacBook and then dissed because it isn't as thin, as light, or if all else fails, because it runs Windows and therefore feels less premium and has less battery life.  Any advantages the device may have (better specs, lower price) are disregarded because MacBooks have bad specs and a high price so therefore these criteria must not matter.  This isn't meant to be a MacBook killer. This is at worst just a generic laptop with a brand, and at best the ideal companion for a Razer Core and external GPU. Does it succeed at the latter? Is this a great gaming laptop that is only missing the (external) GPU for now? Who knows. All that matters is apparently whether Mr. Tech Journalist can bring it to trade shows to type articles on.

I do hope you realize these things you mention are in fact tangible factors for most people looking for a new laptop, especially a portable one to be used for daily work and carried around in a bag every day. I have a Macbook precisely for this reason- there are definitely cheaper laptops and ultrabooks to be found but comparable devices to the Macbook 12 are in the same ballpark in terms of cost but each unit has tradeoffs such as an inferior screen, trackpad, battery life, weight, build quality, reputation, speakers, or something. I'm not interested in saving $200-$300 on a laptop with a trackpad I will hate using irregardless of that machine having more options for playing games.   When you look at the other fanless notebooks on the market the 12 falls just ever so right of the middle in terms of pricing. At least it was six months ago when I bought mine.   But even still, I am profoundly disinterested in other notebooks or ultrabooks or laptops whatever for one huge reason: Windows. In my mind, a true Macbook killer is one which utilizes Linux and also can run applications such as Photoshop. The marketing term Macbook Killer will never be true until whoever is trying to make that computer realizes why people are buying Macbooks in the first place.	iamthehtown	t1_d78zqpa

I know that people mean well and praise Apple design and fit and finish, but in my opinion and in the opinion of people that I respect that have worked in the smartphone industry, Apple uses their famed design and brand cache to cover up subpar components and inferior internal build quality. Not always, I suppose - I also had the Swiss cheese Mac tower and that case was a few years ahead of everyone else.

t3_51hv7s	t1_d7c92lp	1473211363	It's a deal breaker until you start seeing Samsung and everyone else follow suit, cause I got news for you, it's coming whether you like it or not.	Mahadragon	t1_d7c6nel
t3_51hv7s	t1_d7c961b	1473211497	Just add a millimeter to the phone. Lol. It won't make a real-world difference. The iPhone already has a big ass camera protrusion. Just add thickness until that bulge is gone and fill the space with battery. Problem solved.	shanenanigans1	t1_d7c9199
t3_51hv7s	t1_d7c9864	1473211579	I haven't. But I have heard of Motorola. I agree though, this is just a cash grab. Sound has to be converted back to analog by a dac. So the whole 'digital signal' bullshit is just that. Bullshit.	shanenanigans1	t1_d7c7l50
t3_51hv7s	t1_d7c9lme	1473212117	You're right; it's all a conspiracy. Apple is taking the headphone jack out so they can mind-control all their consumers via the new bluetooth headphones. The next step? World Domination.	ZackZak30	t1_d7c7l50
t3_51hv7s	t1_d7cbn9p	1473215120	Well I gotta say a lot this is bullcrap. I already think my phone is thin enough(I have a galaxy s5) and its not like 4 mm^3 is gonna make my battery life double or anything. I think the big reason why everyone is tossing out the 3.5 mm jack is because usb-c has native HDCP compliance. This allows them to stop any traffic that doesn't have this license ie: any pirated stuff just won't play. Unlike the 3.5 mm heahphone jack, this allows companies and producers another way to infringe upon what we can do with our mobile devices. So in the end, its just another way to monitor and control what we do.	scar1em	t3_51hv7s

t3_51hv7s	t1_d7cckpg	1473216541	I didnt realise pogue was on Apples pay-roll??? Apple stand to make a pile of case out of licensing fees as everyone rushes to re-tool their ear wear.    All I have to say is this:   God help Apple if the iPhone doesnt look and feel substantially different to the iPhone 6.  With smartphone design innovation moving so rapidly the market for samey samey design has dried up.	patdude	t3_51hv7s
t3_51hv7s	t1_d7ccxpl	1473217116	It's a cash grab. Plain and simple.  They did it with the new chargers. Now with the headphone jack.   Now selling New Headphones for 30 bucks that probably cost 5$ to manufacture. Except Everyone has to buy them now. Boom instant mass profit.   Blatantly easy to see.	TexanSJF	t3_51hv7s
t3_51hv7s	t1_d7cfeab	1473221534	Sorry, my comment wasn't very clear. What I mean is, why must we sacrifice at all? A phone that's partially larger would allow for both a battery that has a greater capacity and the earphone jack. I'm not sad to see the earphone jack go, I'm aggregated that the pursuit of 'thin'' has come at the cost of practicality. In that sense simply a durable phone that I don't have to worry about charging throughout the day.	Crazycatguy2017	t3_51hv7s

t3_51jhpj	t1_d7cjme7	1473232396	Apple dominates the high-end smartphone market. Android (and to some degree even Windows) has really good saturation on the low end markets, which has swelled total ownership in favor of androids. The LG V20 competes directly with the iPhone (7) and sells fractions of the numbers that Apple does in the high end market. Samsung, right now is the only real competitor on the high end smartphone stage.   To some degree though you're right. The LG V20 isn't coming after the iPhone. It is trying to fight back against the now dominate Samsung.	admronoc	t1_d7ch2i4

Bit of a problem when you are stuck on a 24 month contract as is the norm here in the UK.   Also from talking to friends their G4's were no better, so for me never going to LG again (for anything, my LG TV speaker blew within a month of my warranty running out).

No, it's really not like that at all. This article provides specific arguments rather than giving a hand-wavy, "studies have shown" explanation.   &gt; The only reason apple is getting rid of the the jack is purely to up sell consumers on their wireless headphones  Speak for yourself. Getting rid of the jack creates room to add more components to the phone and it makes it easier to waterproof. Those are obvious, tangible benefits that have nothing to do with selling wireless headphones.  &gt; Like, ask yourself is your current iPhone not thin enough?  A pointless question. I'm always interested in a thinner phone.	mediuqrepmes	t1_d7c7l50

Plus the V20 might have some serious audio recording chops. Which is pretty huge as that's generally the only negative with recording with a phone. That said I would say the 7 is the most innovative product released by apple in a long time. The plus's camera features are very cool and selective focus done right is awesome.

t3_51jhpj	t1_d7dv3gs	1473312980	Same can be said for your metric of choice, comparing a market where there is basically 2 models to choose from with one where tens if not hundreds of options exist will no doubt tell you the one with less internal competition is more popular. That's why we have to look at both how many phones of a certain model are sold, and how many phones with a  certain OS are sold.    Apple dominates the "buy one model"  due to lack of competition within their OS, but over all Android takes a much bigger market share even if it's parkas amongst more phones/producers. The latter is a good example of capitalism at its finest, many fight and the best will rise. The former, well, shows how capitalism can be anything but a free (internal)  market.

t3_51jhpj	t1_d7dxbx2	1473319127	Glitchy software. Taking the jack out and accidentally balsting music in the tram is very embarrassing. Happened few time for no good reason. When i put in headphones, idiotic software trys to determine if it's a headphone, mic out headphone or line out. Usually gets it wrong and for some reason changes the song with your everymove if it's anything other than a headphone. Plastic structure. Clips brake and cover won't staty.  No sodtware updates. Laser focus starched and keeps going out of focus because of that for no other reason. Plastic chassis cracked and lines on the corners. (partially not looking after it well so kinda my fault.) Apps are never optimised for lg. Every device has it's problems. But these little things count big time.

t3_51oa96	t1_d7ec2pj	1473350702	The difference is I can replace my 5 or 10 dollar earbugs at walmart.  No one is complaining about losing them in terms of them being more easliy lost, it's that they cost 160.00 to replace.	lostintransactions	t1_d7dljwf

Losing something isn't an indication that someone is equivilent to 4 years old. Losing someting happens to ALL of us, including you.  These ear buds are not like your iPad or iPhone, it's a tiny device that can fall out of a bag, out of a newly developed hole in a pocket or any of a dozen instances.  There is no long cable attached to easily alert you to where they are and as humans, we are all easily distracted.  There are 1000's of scenarios that I can suggest that will cause even the most attentive person in the world to "lose" one of these and while, YES! we have all lost our 10.00 wired ear buds, they are 10 dollars, not 160.  This also doesn't include damage and wear that doesn't matter much with cheap headphones but does with expensive headphones.  This is not about personal responsibility, this is about the replacement cost.	lostintransactions	t1_d7dxo8i

If you already own a newer sony xperia device I would definitely recommend getting metal case of some sort, just to improve the rigidity .  .  The phone was great, had great battery life/camera and everything, but it was just way too buggy, both with the screen and the SD card always unmounting, I've been using a friends 3 year old s4 as a backup, and it has been really stable by comparison, no issues.  .

t3_51jhpj	t1_d7i0s8r	1473586966	Like others have said, we're in a time where good enough is ubiquitous. A $400 phone is 80% as good as a phone twice its price (i.e. a medium specced iPhone). Apple and android both have payment protocols. 3D Touch will be useful depending on how much you want to use it -- I find it useful for bringing up link opening options and moving the cursor. Mundane, sure, but helpful.   I think phone "innovation" is going to approach a point where the difference between the best and the third or fourth best is predominantly branding, not function. Think about the cameras of the iPhone and nexus 5x/6p. 12 MP shooters, similar performance, 4K, RAW (android first and hopefully for pre-7 iPhones via iOS 10). It's all the same shit. Now the 7plus has a standard and wide angle camera just like the LG G5. Innovation is no longer felt on a year by year basis. It's month by month. Novelty itself wears off and "innovation" is just a marketing term.	TerryTheGnome	t1_d7hyp25

Optical HR that actually works well for changes in HR due to exercise are few and far between, and Apple isn't one of them.

t3_52dzei	t1_d7jkolq	1473690882	Overall, Windows 10 is good. I shut down all the "send data back to MS" stuff, and I've re-configured a few things to look like Windows 7. Other than a few things that are obviously "tablet-y" and having to hunt for a few things that moved a bit from previous versions, it hasn't been onerous.  I'll also say it seems to handle memory a lot better. I've had some issues with apps and browser windows eating RAM in the past, and those seemed to diminish noticeably under Win10. Your mileage may vary, of course.	HapticSloughton	t1_d7jhl29

That leaves the Surface Phone without a CPU.	rtechie1	t3_52dzei

t3_52dzei	t1_d7k17r8	1473712026	I'm not him .. but I use a Surface Pro 3 at work as a desktop replacement.  It's fantastic.  I have it in a dock set up with dual 24" monitors.. really nice setup.  I'm a software dev and do a lot of compiling and database work and it runs like a champ.. performance feels like a mid to high end laptop.  When I need to work from home, I just pop it off the dock and bring it home and I have all my work with me.  VPN into the office and I have everything I need without needing to use remote desktop.  Here is an old pic I took: http://i.imgur.com/DfWHbom.jpg  I've only had a few issues.  My Fiio E10k headphone amp (next to my left monitor in that picture) for whatever reason crashes my Surface sometimes.. but that's probably an issue with the Fiio driver.   Fan can get pretty damn noisy when I stress the CPU. A few times I've had issues with it waking up/turning on, and have had to boot into the BIOS to get it back to life.  I don't do anything in the bios, just the simple act of entering the bios and rebooting fixes most issues.	NessInOnett	t1_d7jx7af
t3_52dzei	t1_d7k3hyb	1473714913	I would buy a surface phone.  I want the ability to turn it into a desktop though.  Like with the Intel PC sticks I want the ability to plug it into a TV or monitor and it be a PC.	atomicvocabulary	t3_52dzei

t3_52dzei	t1_d7kfytl	1473732557	I have an S3 and I much prefer using my iPad 3 as a tablet compared to my surface. Windows is powerful, but its clumsy to use as a tablet. For instance, on the iPad when you select a field, the keyboard automatically pops up. On the Surface, you instinctively tap the field, then you have to bring up the task bar, select the keyboard, and then tap the field, then type. And the apps are just utter garbage compared to the iPad. The best reddit client is the browser, and after loving Alien Blue, it's so much worse. Certainly being able to run desktop apps is nice, but it's not something I would want to do for everything, although being able to run uTorrent on a tablet still blows my mind.  I got my Surface for the digitizer, and I'm not terribly disappointed, but once I graduate at the end of the year I'll probably sell it. I will have to say though, buy used. I got my S3 64GB with the keyboard in like-new condition for $240 on the Amazon Marketplace. Pro 3's can be had for around $400! It's a buyers market for the Surface! Might as well use the poor resale value to your advantage!	KimJong_Bill	t1_d7jx7af

t3_52dzei	t1_d7kqhlx	1473753163	The iPad Air 2 is more a tablet while the Surface, even though advertised as a tablet, is still a PC.  I use my Surface Pro like a laptop and very rarely as a tablet. It's just too big as a tablet for casual browsing or reading while in bed or on the couch. It's great if you use a stylus frequently or if you dock it to use as your main PC.  It's light and very portable if you need a full PC for travel. I use an iPad and a Surface Pro. Both have their strengths.  It's really about what you need in a device.  I think the price is fair for the form factor and performance, but there's definitely some value in getting one on the secondary market.	evilr2	t1_d7jx7af

t3_52dzei	t1_d7m1yf4	1473829704	I think you're assuming a little bit much. The phones really are powerful and to me at least, giving up snap chat wasn't a big deal and I have most of what I need.

The size feels right and the device isn't heavy at all. Despite that, it's a very well made device and the build quality is superb. The main issues I have are the battery life(it's good, but not iPad level good), the tablet app store sucks ass and some weird Windows 10 bugs. So, yes, it's a well made device, but it's a bit overpriced.	thenoisymerc	t1_d7jx7af

Super slow if it even loads properly and all outdated and some apps are not functional at all. The remote doesn't work further than 6 ft away either. Their support, if they could even understand me over the language barrier told me "oh well, it's a few months out of warranty so we won't fix it.

t3_52v3v2	t1_d7npbbz	1473942371	I'll just clarify for a moment that I spend all day using Apple products either for teaching Music Technology or working as a sound engineer. I do have an android phone but I wouldn't consider myself a fanboy for any particular brand...  We'll let the results speak for themselves when these earphones have been properly tested and we have access to frequency response and waterfall plots.  I cannot say for sure but I anticipate that the battery life and sound quality will be laughable, given the price tag. I also question the decision to make them out of hard plastic instead of having a rubber earpiece create a good seal that allows them to perform to their stated spec.  Many people will buy them because they're trendy. The number of units sold won't necessarily be a reflection of the quality, just look at Beats by Dre as an example...  Apple probably has one of the best marketing teams in the world, but they use their high profile to push products that aren't as innovative as they make them appear, or deliberately hiding weak specs and getting away with it.   They make alluring products and have a strong brand identity that counts for quite a lot when shopping for something new.   That's not suggesting that specifically Apple fans are sheep, rather that their marketing team has achieved everything any marketing team for any company (including Samsung etc) wants to achieve: Get people on board, keep them, and then tell them they need a certain product  Apple don't have a monopoly, but they are big enough to tell people that they want what they want them to want.	_STONEFISH	t1_d7np45b

Examples of hardware tech they introduced or were early to adopt in the last few years:  * Touch ID (fingerprint sensor that doesn't suck) * 3D Touch (accurate pressure-sensitive screens) * Taptic Engine (very precise and customizable haptic feedback) * Motion coprocessors (low-energy always-on processing of various sensors) * Secure enclave (on-chip encrypted storage not accessible by software) * True Tone flash (flash that adapt its color temperature to match ambient light) * True Tone display (display that adapt its color temperature to match ambient light) * Two-camera system that elegantly simulates an optical zoom * Apple Pencil (stylus that feels the most natural compared to a real pencil)  They also design industry-leading custom ARM CPUs, ISPs and NVMe storage controllers.  Meanwhile Android phones have lots of hardware features the iPhone doesn't have, but you can't attribute a lot of them to a single manufacturer.	p_giguere1	t1_d7f685n

I'm the best of world's this would be true and the best product would be the best selling. Sadly all you need is advertising to create a demand, use your money to stop the competition and create a walled garden. Lock users to your eco system and force change upon them for the worse. No one asked for this, no one, it adds nothing that the old phones couldn't do. Apples not giving people a product they want, they're forcing them to get it or loose everything (apps, contacts, calender, the white eco system.

t3_52v3v2	t1_d7npm4o	1473942989	&gt;just look at Beats by Dre as an example...  That's a fashion accessory though.

t3_51jhpj	t1_d7nqq58	1473945091	It's 14% worldwide because of developing markets buying billions of cheap phones.  If we stick to the US where more high-end phones are sold (because that's what we are comparing here), then the numbers are completely different:  * Apple 43% * Samsung 28% * LG 10% * Motorola 5% * HTC 3%  https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings/comScore-Reports-February-2016-US-Smartphone-Subscriber-Market-Share  And those are all phones sold in the US, not just the premium ones. If only premium phones were measured (again, because that's what we're comparing here. No point comparing flagships to budget phones) Apple would likely have at lest 60% market share, since that's all they sell.  They are still the leading premium smartphone manufacturer by quite a good margin. Counting cheap smartphones sold in India/China doesn't change that.	p_giguere1	t1_d7ch2i4
t3_52v3v2	t1_d7nrke3	1473946480	They are most definitely a fashion accessory. Some of their streetwear is indeed marketed as such, but I take issue with the claims of them having good sound quality.  I can go and find some test sheets to back up what I'm saying if people are interested (my opinion doesn't really matter so probably not!) but I would argue that they are objectively poor performers.  They look cool if you like the style, but they're marketed very dishonestly, soundwise.  They immediately sound fat and impressive, but they have very lethargic overblown bass and piercing highs, which fatigue ones hearing after an extended listening session.  They are useless in the studio, because their inaccuracy makes it very hard to mix music.  For the same price it is possible to get headphones that are *significantly* better.  While streaming mp3s is of course not ideal, a good pair of headphones will genuinely make a high bitrate mp3 sound decent. Everything except the compression artefacts will sound good.    Edit: I just looked at the official website, at the "professional studio" model. Apart from the lies and deceptive marketing, everything you need to know about them is due to how they haven't published the specs on that page.	_STONEFISH	t1_d7npm4o

t3_52v3v2	t1_d7nz2zm	1473956577	To be honest I called them "mediocre" not "good". And yeah I agree that with a good bitrate mp3 you can hear the difference but we are talking about at least 328kbps (and ideally all your mp3s should actually be VBR0) that most streaming services don't support.   Don't think I'm calling Beats good or anything, but when it comes to how their audio quality is advertised they are definitely going after people without good set ups who will be impressed at how much better Beats sound compared to their cheap earbuds that came with the phone.	back2dashit	t1_d7nrke3

t3_532xtg	t1_d7pqra7	1474058100	It's not a bad point. I think it's a very **very** interesting thing to discuss. Can Apple even go back on a decision like this? What would have to happen for them to basically admit they were wrong and take a **Huuuuuge** PR hit doing it?  Their brand would be seriously hurt by doing so, because it would mean Apple might not be so great they once were. Besides, they're pretty arrogant to begin with, removing the jack and all. They won't budge that stubbornness any time soon.  So yeah, I don't see it happening unless they lose something like... &gt;30% of all phone sales, in such a short period that it's obvious that it's the jack's fault.	Ree81	t1_d7plbld

t3_532xtg	t1_d7q55vz	1474081392	before anyone says I'm an Android fan boy, I've come to term with people buying and using iOS (I myself have though about having an iOS just so I can develop on it).   iPhone is just thinking of this: "Take jack away, the dumb asses will buy iPhone 7. We'll wait a few months and make a plus that has a jack to sell to rest of the consumers." They are trying to set a trend, but it's not going to work because most android/window OEM wont ditch the 3.5 mm jack because its a multi-industry standard. What were the differences between iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus? Screen size, what was trending? Bigger screens. Nexus 6, Note series, Honor 5, etc etc. And imo the plus did pretty well. And now 5.5 is a mobile standard.   If apple really wanted to set a trend they should have jumped on the USB-C train before Nexus and many others did. I honestly would have applauded them, but they missed that train.   Its said because in the Audio industry firewire/thunderbolt used be the norm (and for a good reason), but I've noticed that when audio companies make newer edition of hardware you'll see USB editions and firewire/thunferbolt (when older edition you'll see only firewire or thunderbolt).   Apple did set industry standard as form goes. I will give them that. But software has always been their downfall. But with this move in my opinion, they've just shot themselves in the foot.	mithusingh32	t1_d7pqra7

One example I can think of is like this: one day the screen brightness settings are labeled as dark-bright-brighter-brightest, and the next update, it says it's 25%-50%-75%-100%. Most of the time you wouldn't even notice it, but it's as if they're still experimenting and trying to fine tune stuff.   Anyway, the problem's still apps, so if you're a heavy user, you'd find it wanting, but there seems to have enough  apps to satisfy a lot of people.	acc2016	t1_d7jhl29

You only need to remember their stubbornness to use motorola processors instead of Intel.  How about the time when they wanted everyone to use firewire?  And after years of trying to push for OSX they later introduced bootcamp so users could run Windows.  They really go all out to force you into their system.  Sorry but the audiophiles, DJs and anyone with thousand dollar equipment who care about music and videos are not going to buy into this crap just yet.  My advice is to avoid Apple for at least a year or two until they make something that's actually worth looking at.	sanjugo	t3_532xtg

The only thing I can imagine is screen (matters if you are doing VR I guess), and ram (where the iPhone actually holds more in memory than popular Android flagships, so the number itself is relatively meaningless).  In contrast as an Android fan, I’m actually pretty annoyed that not one top Android phones has caught up to last generation’s iPhone with regards to some really critical (for me) areas where the iPhone excels:   * CPU (Especially single thread performance which matters most for UI and most apps)   * GPU (Especially when in use for long periods of gaming)   * NVMe storage (which has a huge impact on cold load times)   * Hardware (non-CPU) based FDE (no overhead penalty like when using the CPU for encryption)   * Passcode hashing with hardware-only keys to prevent off-device passcode cracking (Qualcomm’s implementation is [totally broken](http://www.slashgear.com/android-soc-security-keys-extracted-qualcomm-trustzone-in-question-31442245/))  Its pretty hard to look at those key features where Apple is dominant and claim with a straight face that they are “nearly a generation behind” when that only applies to VR capacity and the headphone jack.	compounding	t1_d7qw7nh

The iPhone with 2GB of ram had every app pre-loaded and ready to go in the background during the second “lap”, but the One^+ had to reload several apps (especially games, but also the browser) because it wasn’t keeping them open in the background even with 6 GB of ram on the spec sheet.  I don’t know what accounts for the discrepancy, but the experience for the user is that the iPhone often performs better at managing ram and keeping apps open than phones with 2x or even 3x the amount. Ultimately, no matter what the “number” is, what matters is how it performs, so it seems reasonable to dismiss the ram discrepancy if it still performs better than phones that are “maxed out” on ram anyway.	compounding	t1_d7s9xnj

It's also why a lot of people want to keep SIM cards: a physical card means that you can take it out and put it into another phone without your provider's input, and the GSM standard allows any SIM card that already works on the network to work with any phone that also supports GSM networks. With SIMless systems you need to actually ask your provider to port your plan between phones.	accountnumberseven	t1_d7sw9u7

Some relevant tests:   * [iPhone 7 vs Galaxy S7 deep water test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K05cTPeFfyM) * [Boiling an iPhone for 7 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkG4-EgFOM8)  It survived both of those, it survived iFixit keeping it submerged for hours, it survived being dunked in Cola and frozen.

Optical image stabilization isn't there to help people with Parkinson's, it's to provide much better hand-held low-light performance, because you can keep the shutter open for much longer during a night-time exposure.

The iPhone's flash storage is twice as fast as the note 7. So it should be expected that the iPhone 7 would load things like games much quicker.  As for GPU and CPU speed. I can't remember from the top of my head, but while the iPhone 7 is twice as fast in single core, the multi core score is similar. And android does use multiple cores so you can't disregard multi core scores. I can't remember the GPU results. I think iPhone was a bit faster.  And in day to day usage, they're about equal.

t3_537axa	t1_d7tq3a3	1474321158	&gt; The reason why I believe this cannot be a hardware issue is because others have been mentioning this since the release of the phone.

Your reasons for dismissing "this can't be a hardware problem" are not valid/logical.  &gt;  My guess is that since the update to Nougat, which was only a few days prior, some bug must have found its way in.

t3_53h2yq	t1_d7tq82q	1474321337	You mean, apps that are smaller are neck and neck, but the moment they have to load something big, the difference is apparent. Also, samsung and android phones can't handle encryption very well. It slows the phone down to a crawl.	Fatfaggottreat1	t1_d7tq1al
t3_536sxn	t1_d7tr9oa	1474322735	That doesn't make any sense. A new phone is ONLY hardware. You could update the software without getting a new phone.   When Apple includes android features they are "copying". When they don't they are "behind". When they have features android phones don't those features don't matter or are "gimmicks".   When people (mistakenly) think the iPhone is weaker than android phones it's a huge deal. When they find out that the iPhone is about a year ahead of their competition in SoC and that their storage blows any android phone out of the water then it's "speed doesn't matter".   Android phones are great but the constant moving of the goalposts by people who just can't see the good points about iPhones is tiresome. The variety is nice in the industry. Apple offers something different that a lot of people like and a lot of people don't. Don't see why people go so far towards one thing or another.	Lalzballzz	t1_d7tnp5r

t3_53h2yq	t1_d7v5sz0	1474406571	here has been no viruses yet on an IOS phone that hasn't been jailbroken. There was a virus last year built into an app. But it only affected jailbroken phones. It affected jailbroken phones, because you caught the virus by downloading software from a non apple source in china. If I am accept my apology, I am reciting this from memory.    You are 100% right all phones are vulnerable to web or wireless attacks. And even loophole hacks. The last one being siri on the lock screen. The difference is that because IOS isn't open source, you know that when you do a full reboot, then you are back to a secure system. Until it is allowed to go into another compromising set up again. Because Android is open source you cannot get that guarantee.     If I did buy an Android, and I really did consider it, then I would only do my banking on the ipad I own. I wouldn't use my phone anymore.     My freedom to do what I want - I leave that to my PC.	The-Syldon	t1_d7udda5
t3_53h2yq	t1_d7v7izh	1474408877	Note 7 actually has a slightly better camera if you look at the pictures and photos. The screen quality is substantially better on the note 7 (oled display) and the battery life is better too. The only thing iPhone is better at is the CPU. Waterproofing is practically the same, you're not going to notice the different. As for security, ios is better, but if you don't install 3rd party applications you will be fine on android.

Please note - due to the current lack of Pascal support on macOS, the 1060 is recommended for Windows/Bootcamp users only (for now). However, we expect that to change very soon - so we won't make you decide too early.  The kickstarter mentions it.

t3_53h2yq	t1_d7vo665	1474435563	I probably should have phrased that better. It was directed at the two comments above. I am not an Apple fan either. I dislike the restrictive OS they throw out every year. But I do see the merits of it when it comes  to security.      The water rating is Apple being clever. Because they know that there are bodies out there that are going to do a million and one comparison tests.     The note 7 falls well with in its ip68 rating so it is not advertised wrongly. Apple's iPhone will operate at the same rating and has been shown to go further. It is a quality perception gimmick. A lot will see the recent video and think wow well if they underrated the IP rating so low, what is the rest of the phone like. It also means they cannot have any warranty claims for any phone that are slightly below par.     They did the same with the original Applewatch. For all they took away any water resistance rating people were using it for showering and even swimming.	The-Syldon	t1_d7v7os2

Oh, and how about making the phone bigger packing more battery and computing power, instead of making it so thin that it actually bends when sit on. And did they consider that using bluetooth also interferes with wifi? Yeah, those 2.4 and 2.5 ghz bands are completely fucked because of the iphone 7. And how about that front facing speakers?

Personally, I use the 5se because the others are too large for my taste.    Apple isn't the first to do this and they won't be the last.

t3_53xg6s	t1_d7xbbqk	1474544501	Call me old fashioned, but, in my opinion, wireless over-ear/on-ear headphones are the best design.  Bulkier than earbuds, sure, but they have far superior battery life, don't look any different from wired versions aside from not having a cable, and you don't have any risk of them falling out and losing them. Also, when you don't want them on your ears, you can just have them rest around your neck/on your shoulders. Usually better sound quality, too.  Admittedly, on/over-ear headphones aren't great for running/workouts.	ZippoS	t3_53xg6s

You don't miss phone calls or messages, you can use it to change your music tracks, you can quickly reply to messages without getting your phone out and you can use it for Apple Pay.

t3_536sxn	t1_d7y9ho2	1474592631	I was talking about the dongle, not the car adapter. Removable cables have been around for a good while now for reasons having nothing to do with Apple's decisions.  So the crucial difference about the removal of the floppy drive is that there was a vastly better technology already in place to replace it, the CD drive. There's that Elon Musk quote about how something can't just be a little bit better (which the lightning port can't even say it is (there are technical reasons why it's inferior to the 3.5mm)), it has to be a *lot* better if it's going to replace or carve out a space for itself among existing technologies. (He said it of cars but the same applies to tech)  Trust me, if the lightning port/USBC audio was a better alternative, I would be all for it as a tech-geek. There is just not enough of a reason to get rid of the jack. Until something better comes along, I'll keep buying devices, even if they're slightly bigger, *with a fucking headphone jack*, and that don't need a fucking *dongle* to perform a simple function.

In fact, that video actually gives an explanation for the discrepancy which I didn’t know about. The phone uses extremely aggressive ram management even despite having 6 GB RAM to preserve battery life (they say). Whatever the reason, what good is the hardware if it is software limited to prevent it from being used?  If I had to guess, I’d say that the company doesn’t think 6 GB is a good investment in actual performance of the device, but just wants to have a big number on the box for marketing purposes.	compounding	t1_d80ga7o

t3_53e8ek	t1_d82h2es	1474887099	I don't find my hate to be excessive. They're poorly made and underspec'd for what they cost. They're like the AOL of the computing world, getting rich off people's apathy towards choice.  Hey look, what's this.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA3FA4PD3742  it's a thinner and lighter laptop than a 13" macbook pro with basically the same specs for literally half the cost.  I'm not arguing that they're trash, they're not trash, they're fine, they're perfectly serviceable, occasionally they have significant design flaws that need to be repaired, sadly they are an incredibly consumer hostile corporate environment that makes servicing these necessary repairs expensive and time consuming and yet another profit center for the company.  Imagine a really expensive luxury car, like an Aston Martin. When it breaks down you can't just go to your local garage, you need a special Aston Martin certified repair shop, the work and the parts are expensive and you don't really have a choice. Apple is like that, except instead of the car being an Aston Martin, it's a Kia Spectra. There's nothing at all wrong with a Kia Spectra for what it is, if what you want to do is drive to work each day and have it basically work, good, great. If you try to take it to a street race or a car show they will laugh in your face.  When a Kia Spectra charges $90,000 MSRP and has exclusive certified dealership programs and uses arbitrarily frustrating and proprietary parts that could easily have just been stock and don't improve performance but just make it expensive to replace.. car guys get mad. That's apple. Here comes this product, "The Wolfe" as an aftermarket kit to cherry up your kia spectra into a muscle car by quite literally installing a second engine in the trunk to have two seperate engines, one rear wheel drive one front wheel drive, and they kit costs $40,000 on top of the 90k you dropped on the Kia Spectra in the first place, and to be fair to the 40k price tag you're getting an L92, a 6.2L beast of an engine throwing out 400+ horses and 415 foot pounds of torque, you're not getting all of that to the wheels sure because this is a slapped on after market kind of chop job but hell, it's a serious fucking engine. And yeah, you could probably race in it now. But by this point you've spent 130K and could have just bought an Audi A8 outright and still saved money on the deal but then, oh no, it wouldn't have been a Kia, wouldn't have that little logo on the front of it.   That's my problem with apple, and it is a well justified one.  -edit to remove erroneous response to the wrong dude. My bad.	Steelcap	t1_d82g03p

t3_53e8ek	t1_d82hble	1474887857	Also they aren't poorly made at all, I can't think of any Apple products that are poorly made. The MacBook is a finely engineered laptop, the Mac Pro is another incredible feat.  &gt; sadly they are an incredibly consumer hostile corporate environment that makes servicing these necessary repairs expensive and time consuming and yet another profit center for the company.  Simply not true, Apple are widely and regularly regarded as the industry lead for customer service within the technology industry. In fact one of the main reasons I stick with Apple is the ease and simplicity of being able to walk into an Apple store with a (not always) defective product and walk out with a brand new replacement.  Check out the guys in /r/Apple it seems every other week there's a post in there about a guy taking in a faulty MacBook Pro from 2011 and being given a 2016 model as a replacement free of charge.  AppleCare is also extremely cheap compared to insurance alternatives and the solutions of rival companies like HP, so I struggle to see where you're getting 'profit center for the company' from.  &gt; That's apple. Here comes this product, "The Wolfe"  Sigh. This product isn't exclusive to Apple products, it works on any Thunderbolt device, (you know, that extremely expensive Intel technology that was first adopted and pushed out by that shitty Kia-esque company known as Apple, despite the fact most other manufacturers still neglect to include it)  You're very good at pointing out non-existent faults with Apple whilst neglecting to mention their actual faults (which there are many, none of which you've listed), and also neglecting to mention their strengths.  You seem entirely clueless and just have an excessive hatred for Apple, it's almost you replied to my comment to prove it as a parody of yourself.	Rogerss93	t1_d82h2es

Sure it gets less battery than your Surface 3 and is more expensive but it's also significantly faster, like almost as fast as the fan using Surface Pro 4. Much much faster than the Atom in the Surface 3. Plus it has a real SSD instead of eMMC and way more RAM. This thing will be significantly faster and more usable in Photoshop than a Surface 3. The Surface Pro series also doesn't charge by MicroUSB, it's just not an option with more powerful processors. Charging by USB C is possible though, so points for that.  This is really a Surface Pro competitor, the Surface 3 isn't really in the same performance league.	PersimBerry	t1_d82ik3r

The only reason I'd think these hybrid machines are cool is if the keyboard is detachable and still works as a wireless keyboard. That'd be cool I suppose. If hybrids aren't doing that, they should.  I could imagine cases where I'd be more comfortable if I could place my laptop's screen in one place while typing nearby, like in bed I could put the screen on the night stand and type from my lap or something. I wouldn't have to sit up to use the keyboard.   I imagine there are use cases for tablets that involve drawing or something.

t3_54ixzq	t1_d82lzyf	1474897670	I tried an HP Spectre x2 first - got one for $450 from Amazon recently, but it was by far the least stable Windows computer I've ever used (out of 5 Windows 10 machines in our home, 2 that I built).   Ended up buying this Acer from Costco - $650 for the i5, 8gb ram, 256gb SSD version that also includes the pen. Like it a lot so far. Recently took it on a 3 night family vacation, using it to check e-mail and news in the morning and evenings. Didn't have to charge it once, although I left the battery saver on.   One thing about the screen not mentioned - it is BRIGHT, which is probably one of the reasons battery life takes a hit. Much brighter than the HP, and some reviews I've seen say the max brightness is higher than other 2-in-1s, including the Surface.	eyefullawgic	t1_d82bxro

t3_54ixzq	t1_d834uhs	1474921948	Acer had few bad series of lower end models like 10 years ago. the bad name stuck. it didnt help that Acer seels mostly dirt cheap laptops, but that is changing in recent years, especially last two years show very different Acer. Their market share in 500+ and even 900+ USD segment is rising and rightly so. Before Alpha 12, which beats its competition in the price/performance ratio, there were V13 and S13 laptops with genuinely unique price/performance proposition and the Nitro family which has quite some following. And their gaming stuff under Predator Brand? The best gaming monitors out there and their laptops are very well reviewed as well.  I have reviewed quite some Acer PCs during the last 5 years and used them personally (on my own money) - Chromebook 720, Chromebook 13 and V13 and now I have my Alpha. All that while having access to PCs like Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro, Dell XPS 13 or HP Envy. What I like about stuff I buy the most is what my money get me, and with Acer i have found the best value. Your mileage may vary of course.	otaschon	t1_d82j5l1

t3_54y74o	t1_d8610rz	1475095675	U.S. regulators on Wednesday warned owners of certain top-loading Samsung washing machines of "safety issues" following reports that some have exploded.  The warning, from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, covered machines made between March 2011 and April 2016. It did not specify a model.  The commission suggested people use only the delicate cycle to wash bedding and water-resistant and bulky items because the lower spin speed "lessens the risk of impact injuries or property damage due to the washing machine becoming dislodged."  The agency said it is working with Samsung on a remedy.   The warning comes more than a month after Samsung was hit with a federal class-action lawsuit by customers who said their machines had exploded during use. Customers in Texas, Georgia and Indiana all said they were washing clothes when they heard a violent boom.  A washer belonging to a McAllen, Texas, woman "exploded with such ferocity that it penetrated the interior wall of her garage," according to court filings. A woman in Dallas, Georgia, said it felt and sounded as if "a bomb went off."	BigAstra	t1_d860qle

I can safely say my 3 iPods never bent however.  But every apple cable I've never owned sure has.  I've gone through a laptop charger and roughly 3 iphone/ipod cables due to bending.

I talked to someone from the call center and they asked for the model number and serial number of the washer. I gave it to them and they told me that it wasn't covered under the recall. They told me that it was built in July of 2013 when we had a receipt from Lowe's that showed it was purchased in January of 2013.

Kicks the shit out of the craptastic whirlpool washer that failed exactly after the warranty period was over.   I did plug in my serial number on their website to check "if my unit is effected" and it is.   *shrugs* I'm a single guy and maybe do 2 or 3 loads of laundry a week, not a big deal.   Hope they wind up doing someting cool -- like giving me a wad of cash back, or swap it out for something newer/safer.   If it blows up I'm covered either way, with my luck on washers I got a square trade warranty for a pretty good price. I figure it something happens I'm covered either way.   I've seen the results of some of these washer "explosions", mostly pieces of plastic everywhere, and in some cases damage to drywall or whatever is sitting next to it. When in a full spin cycle there's a serious amount of kinetic energy flowing, and it could seriously mess someone up if they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.	MrNerd82	t3_54y74o

I had 2 samsung galaxy phones back in the day, both had numerous issues including screens just failing, batteries dying within a few months and various other weird issues. Also had a Samsung smart TV that would disconnect from the internet consistently. Called support literally 11 times, they would push update after update to the TV all of which over time REMOVED features I bought the TV for, the built in guide GONE, the smart hub features GONE. Finally a support tech got sent out who replaced literally the whole tv mainboard, wireless adapter everything. Still had the same issues, Samsung's official word was I had to be within 10 feet of my wireless router in order to get a dependable signal. WTF? Then when I informed them I work IT and 10 feet is ridiculous for a wireless N device, they offered to either BUY back the TV for $500.00 I payed 1,300 or I could swap it for a 4k tv refurbished for $500.00 but would have to give them the TV. The "customer support" side of Samsung is a shit show. I had to fight for a month to even get THOSE options.	livevicarious	t3_54y74o

t3_53yldx	t1_d87ytb1	1475213127	Lol, Battery is the most important thing for smartwatch users many people use smartwatch for fitness tracking which requires constant use of battery and Apple Watch looks are great, Apple purposely chose square design for proper usability because smartwatch has small touchscreen, it was wise decision by apple and for performance Apple Watch was given bad reviews because it was slow at doing task like opening apps slower thus performance boost a huge thing for smartwatch users. It does lot of things for me like I can pay with my Apple Watch no to remove smartphone with Apple Pay using NFC, I can take calls, I can glance at my notifications even reply back using Siri,  its and  awesome fitness tracker for me, the heartrate sensor are quite good, I can control music app too.	piyushr21	t1_d87ycl0
t3_54wa0e	t1_d88b04v	1475245110	Yeah it says so in the article:  &gt;The stick costs $40, the same price as the previous model, but now includes the voice remote, which used to cost an additional $10.  It's not far down, did you not see it?	Farcrypanda	t1_d8784y4

t3_55ifox	t1_d8bfqla	1475451047	Antennas are basically strips of metal, I highly doubt this will effect the signal in any meaningful way.   Edit: Here's pictures of when I made an Xperia Z Ultra with no external inputs. One of the pictures is the antenna I created for it put of aluminum foil and some heat resistant electrical tape. The antenna actually works much better than the original and for a few days I used the phone with no antenna attached. It still had service. Though the reception was awful.    http://m.imgur.com/l4Rr1KW,bt93AiI,G4gwQra,rwjyASm,oDyvJKr	qwasz123	t1_d8bbap4

t3_55ifox	t1_d8bgn0k	1475452424	If that were true then why would Apple, a company that prides itself on good design, put those ugly strips of metal on their phones? It's out of necessity.	TurboChewy	t1_d8bfqla
t3_55ifox	t1_d8bgtym	1475452732	I'm well aware, I've built antenna for a number of design in school. Just attaching a chunk of metal to the circuit will prove to be a sufficient antenna. While it might lose some efficiency the vast majority of signal can still be picked up.   That's why on older antenna TV sets you can attach aluminum foil or hold onto the antenna yourself to clear up static. Antenna technology is complex, but fractal antenna designs aside you're not getting a huge difference.	qwasz123	t1_d8bg2l1
t3_55ifox	t1_d8bgvul	1475452813	They don't want to ground the signal. Most electronics use the case as a universal ground. The Moto 360 (OG) uses its housing as an antenna.	qwasz123	t1_d8bgn0k
t3_55ifox	t1_d8bh3yn	1475453173	Wish Apple would go back to the slab sides, made the phone much more attractive, architectural, etc.    Instead we have this useless and mindless quest for "thin" simply because some POS Android was "thinner"...  Thin hasn't been an issue for generations, and as we've seen THIN just means fragile and bendable.  The dimensions that are an issue are X and Y, Z doesn't benefit anymore from thin.	Merovean	t3_55ifox
t3_55ifox	t1_d8bhj1d	1475453841	That POS android is actually a fairly powerful, very versatile machine with about double the battery life of any iphone.	guiltyandstupid	t1_d8bh3yn
t3_55ht30	t1_d8bhk00	1475453883	Nope there's some Android phones with 7000mah battery or something crazy like that. Think it's made by THL  quick search, Gionee Marathon has much better battery life (6000mah v 3500mah)	jaw2floor	t3_55ht30
t3_55ifox	t1_d8bhu0a	1475454310	It's been said time and time again, but I feel it needs repeating here: power, versatility, and battery life mean nothing if your software is sub-par. When every tech review site still complains about proprietary skins and sluggish performance on modern hardware, there's a very clear problem at the core of the platform that needs to be addressed.	JaredWsSb	t1_d8bhj1d
t3_55ifox	t1_d8bidzr	1475455183	Those exact same proprietary issues and sluggish performance can be said about the iphone. Pick up a 1 year old android load the most recent version and works like any new android. Pick up a 6s and you instantly have issues with even the last update to ios 9 let alone ios 10. As a person who works with phones every day and has honestly gotten to the point where I realize phones are all about personal taste, iphones are equal to android in os.   Both are solid, both are going to do everything you want to just as well as the other. Android can be customized to do a hell of a lot more with a lot less work, but out of the box, they are 90% equal on what they will do. Cameras are about the same, processors are roughly the same, but batteries have always been better on android. IOS is terrible for battery performance from my experience but still a good os. Where ios shines is versatility across devices.   That is honestly the one area where android hasn't done it first and struggles. Your Apple ID has enough stuff attached to it, it's easier and faster to switch from phone to iPad to MacBook than it is with android. Android has a few extra steps or a couple extra apps you have to use to make it happen. They haven't quite gotten there. I am impressed with ios 10. It's the first ios to impress me in a while. But it impresses me because it's starting to see things the way androids have for a while.   Neither are POS. Androids biggest downfall is LG and their insistence to cut corners and put out phones like the risio, k4 and k8. They have underpowered processors, too small batteries and shit touchscreens. Androids downfall is the fact that every phone manufacturer has to make budget phones where they can't put the high-end pieces in it. IPhone feels they don't have to cater to poor people because they actively don't want poor people using their products new. They want to keep their phones a status symbol.	guiltyandstupid	t1_d8bhu0a
t3_55ht30	t1_d8bin0o	1475455584	Yeah but that can't be bought in the US where the op probably lives	osiris355	t1_d8bhk00
t3_55ifox	t1_d8bjxw0	1475457531	Such as? I gave points and arguments for my perspective with hands on experience working with both types of devices everyday. You briefly mentioned biased reviews with no sources and I did the same. I even included the pros and cons of the devices and things I liked about both and didn't like. What is your counterpoint? Or are you so caught up in thinking you're better than  an android user because you have a phone that hasn't really don't anything innovative that android didn't do first in about 4 years that you just disagree without reason?   Water resistant? Motorola turbo was water resistant and even has a shatterproof screen.  Dual cameras? Lg has a dual camera on the g5 and dual pixel cameras have been around even longer than that while apple still used a 12 megapixel.  Apple pay? Apple pay has to be used at select vendors only where as android pay and Samsung pay can be used at dozens more without the vendor having to invest in specialized scanners.   The card system ios 10 uses? Google cards have been around for at least 3 years which do all the same things.  Drawing in messages? Thanks to androids more open source coding, apps have been around that let you do this since the original Droid when it launched 6 years ago.  What if anything other than the cross compatibility can an apple do better than an android out of the box? The 7 yes has a better battery life than the 6s but when most 6s' last 8 to 10 hours on average usage, it's not hard to beat. Androids have batteries in the moto z that last 48 hours on the same kind of usage and the note 5's still last 16 to 20 depending on the apps on it and os version. Performance is comparable. As far as the "sluggishness" that you slightly mentioned, that is all about settings you can actually control yourself through either on board settings or by downloading a different laucher.   So again, you sound like an idiot when you do nothing but say android is a pos. Android has constantly been innovating and creating new things while apple has been chilling waiting to see what has worked that they can copy and what hasn't so they can avoid it. IPhone is an elitist status symbol at this point. Yes they are quality devices that work incredibly well. But an iphone compared to an equally price ranged android, performs no better no better on any metric. The only features that are ios exclusive are live photos (app for that) and 3d touch(app for that too).	guiltyandstupid	t1_d8bj1ee

Opinions alone don't sway me. So far I've given honest opinion and facts regarding my position. You on the other hand keep leaving leading comments that contribute zero to anything. Maybe you should reconsider the value you believe you bring to this and actually drop it or you can contribute and actually say something that backs up your opinion.   So far all you've said was about a review regarding a mystery device with no information about said phone other than its android nor did you provide any source. That leads me to believe that you have probably never used an android and you hold your nose up at people who do. Walk into a cell phone store and see what the people who do nothing but compare phones day in and day out use as their personal phones. You'll probably see a 75% android, 25% apple with the majority of apple users being the female employees because of the symbol and fashionable accessory it is. So contribute, down vote or actually drop it.	guiltyandstupid	t1_d8bl4k6

Ideally, I would like some sort of sleep tracking capability, but that is not super important. 4. Must work with my phone (a Oneplus 3) 5. A leather band is a plus. 6. Good battery life.

t3_55mjtw	t1_d8c1vrf	1475500316	I'm looking for an outlet or outlet-covering gadget that will connect to my wifi and a server and allow me to turn off whatever is plugged in from the internet.  The device needs to let through a lot of power.  My wife's hair iron thing is like 400 watts.  "I don't remember if I turned off my hot iron, can you check it?"  This is my wife calling me about once a month, asking me to leave my work and go reassure her mind.  And about one out of 12 times that I go check, she really has left it on and it's so hot that the bathroom countertop (ceramic/porcelain) has begun discoloring where it rests.	justinsayin	t3_55mjtw
t3_55mjtw	t1_d8c28wv	1475500992	Number 1 tip that I found when I started playing, is don't expect to get a great device for rock bottom prices. Watches are still quite young tech, and the best formula hasn't been figured out yet, particularly in the lower cost range. You can expect a smartwatch to last you a relatively long time so do invest in it.  I'd recommend a round face, as this effectively renders as a larger screen but with the corners trimmed off. This makes a huge difference to usability. Also you'll want one with wireless charging as on a device this small having a plug is inconvenient and fragile.  I've got the newer Moto 360, which ticks all your other boxes and is Android Wear, so I'd recommend that, but Samsung have also come into the market with a similar design (but not based on Android Wear)	Veranova	t1_d8bw0r7

t3_55mxpk	t1_d8clnll	1475526556	I don't believe this argument holds up anymore.  So many unique phone designs have been released in the past year that don't look quite as similar. The Nextbit Robin would be the most dramatically different example. Samsung did a lot to differentiate itself, and now they have a stellar design language that I think they can really call their own with the S7 Edge and the Note 7. In my opinion, those two devices have some of the most interesting designs on the market right now. And Motorola and Sony have always been doing their own respective things, and with the Z family and the ZX, this year is no different.  Hell, I don't think that any point in Google's Nexus series, including the 6P that I'm typing this on, ever brushed so close to the contemporary iPhone design.	jehsn	t1_d8cj4d5

Mostly been used as a Netflix and AirPlay device over the years, but it being as ancient as the iPad 2 it has started feeling a tad bit out of date and I am genuinely surprised it was still actually being made and sold.

I got a loaner iPhone 7, to try out, and still prefererred the Note after 2 weeks with the Apple. Now the Replacement Note 7 is having battery problems.   I am done with the Note 7. A great phone is not great if it is inherently unsafe. I understand the issues trying to manufacture quality electronics, but I'm done waiting and swapping phones over and over.  Here are my options as I see them: 1. Wait for a Google pixel xl  2. Wait for a LG V20 3. Trade in the Note 7 for some other high end smart phone that is not super brand new  Thoughts?

It's actually a law that they must cover any loss due to theft and fraud.  So that money is paid and gone whether fraud is committed or not. So it's in their best interest not to really stop fraud, because that money is then put back into their control instead of the insurance company.

t3_566p26	t1_d8hjzma	1475819300	Actually not too weak.  Basically you would have to try and use the card 500 times on average for each period it changes to try and guess the number correctly.

However what would be an issue is asynchronous charges.  Put the info now but the company actually doesn't check it till tomorrow because their CC link is down.  That should fail 99.9% of the time.

I suppose it's good for card-present transactions, but the card still has a number that can used for non-present transactions. I really don't get why they didn't just implement 2FA with exchanged keys or text messages. It could completely do away with PINs as well.

It may be 199.99 or 200.01 or the client may call and say MORE! Or just cancel... Also, would make the card useless for any scheduled payment, like your cellphone bill.

Additionally the way that's often worked around is a holding value for $1000 with an actual charge for $200 further down the track (refunding $800).

t3_566p26	t1_d8ho8gr	1475832480	All someone needs is your SIM and they have your phone. And all that takes is social engineering to the cell phone companies.   This is oftentimes how the big youtube channels will get hacked; because your google account is linked to your phone for the event that you get locked out of your account, people will figure out a youtuber's phone number, call the phone company and manipulate them into sending them a replacement SIM.  Now that replacement SIM gets all of their text messages. So they go through the standard password recovery thing for Google. And for any other site that uses a phone number as a means of identification.	Yuktobania	t1_d8hk4jm

Maybe they will, I don't see a cost though (link to where you're getting $50 cost from?) - plus if they become standard then the bank will just move to replacing them like they currently do for 'normal' cards. * Fraudsters move to a different bank? Sure, but that's why it's "Help eliminate fraud" not "solves the problem of fraud overnight". This is more secure than a fixed CVV. That's a good thing. People still accept signatures which are less secure than Chip+PIN - that doesn't mean no-one should move to chip+PIN just 'cause some people don't. * If someone steals the card - the same thing that happens if someone steals the card now. Being just as secure in some cases, and better in other cases, is still better overall.	PyroDragn	t1_d8ho55k

There is no such thing as privacy, and it would be nearly impossible for anyone on Earth to have that ever again.  1. Cellphones have the ability to record audio and video even when turned off. Unless the battery is physically removed, a government agency such as the NSA could easily track you, record your conversations, and has already seen your dick pics.  2. There are cameras EVERYWHERE. Not just in cell phones, but on streets, buildings, keeping 24/7 tabs on people. The government didn't invest so heavily on facial recognition algorithms for shits and giggles.  3. Your expenditures are not private. Your info is sold to any and everyone. Advertising isn't going to respect your privacy any more than a government would. You can't avoid this no matter how much you use cash.   4. If you don't like these things, then protest, write your law makers, vote with your wallet, write the companies, and get your reasoning and ideas out there. Don't just whine and scoff over one device while you ARE USING a device right now that is being tracked. Grow some self awareness people.	Kronos_Selai	t3_56afe7

They are great from a CC company perspective and a vendor perspective because it is easier to argue that a charge wasn't fraudulent (even if it was).    Exchanged keys is a pain to manage on a small basis, and would be a nightmare to handle for something of this scope.   Text messages is a possibility, but there are complications with that too.  Lose your phone?  Can't use your CC.  Don't have a phone?  Can't use your CC.  Phone get cutoff because you didn't pay the bill?  You can't use your CC.    One time use credit card numbers are their own tracking nightmare.    Honestly the ApplePay type model is the best in my opinion though ApplePay isn't implemented with all the protections it could have.  I haven't studied the Google/Android model but assume it is similar.  With those approaches the vendor never gets your CC number, only Apple has that info.    To make it more secure, setting up the CCs in ApplePay should require a step on the CC card side to approve it.   It seems a bit too easy to link someone else's CC to an ApplePay account you control.

Yes my phone's GPS is tracked probably all the time, yes some government agencies could tap into my mic, but are you mad at people for not wanting to be the ones who personally take it a step further?

t3_566p26	t1_d8i27qa	1475858360	Yeah, I mean I get this, in its current state it's not viable (but there are a variety of ways you can use your phone as more of a debit card, and they have pretty good track records), but many of these are also CC issues. You can fake a credit card just like a SIM. The point is, as some point it may as well go that way, because it has a lot of potential benefits over credit cards that you have to fully consider rather than just the potential flaws. Credit cards had many potential flaws, and actually flaws that ultimately caused security problems, but we figure it out scam by scam.	Iksuda	t1_d8ho8gr
t3_566p26	t1_d8i2daj	1475858544	Yeah, definitely, this, but the problem is, at least last I checked, they're more of a debit card or a much better version of those Visas you charge up without a bank. I know a lot of college students who use Google Pay, and it works great for them, but it would never suffice for the older generations, and they'll ultimately push something else on us lest we forget to put ourselves in insurmountable debt.

The only places I see have the tap terminal are places with a lot of college students going, and as far as I know they're not actually credit cards - more debit cards.

t3_566p26	t1_d8i2prc	1475858972	Google had it first I think, but the point is why make a stupid changing card when banks instead of tech giants could use the technology. Also they're all basically debit card equivalents I believe - not actually credit cards.	Iksuda	t1_d8hmt4k

t3_56afe7	t1_d8i40is	1475860573	My point is that almost every person already buys a device that either does that, or can do that. Laptops have webcams and microphones, cellphones have several cameras and obviously a microphone, not to mention tons of other sensors. Cars have computers that record speed, and some have GPS as well. Buying additional devices that track us is what we do now. We all have 1 or 2 cellphones (work cell), lots of people have smart tvs, lots have netbooks/tablets/laptops.... etc.   I think people vastly overestimate how important they think their inane chatter is around the house. "I don't want a device snooping on me!" Ok, fine, but unless you're prepared to live in a pre 1980's world again, or even further back...there's no escaping it. I hated the idea of the Xbox 1 when it came out, because it forced an always on microphone and sensors.   The issue isn't privacy being invaded, it's about what that data is used for once collected. Does my device enforce DRM if people join me on the couch to watch a movie? Not acceptable to me.  If I purchase online computer parts from Newegg.com, will that info be shared? Will it target me with relevant ads? Thats ok to me. I only care when my data is being shared to people who will harass me such as robocallers, or in any way that impedes my day to day life. The Amazon Echo improves quality I believe, and doesn't make it worse. As paranoid as I've been over the years, I had to learn to accept that my chatter around the house means nothing to the government, and the only people interested in it are companies wanting to sell me crap. Is it right that we live in a time where privacy is no longer existent? I don't like it, but that's the reality of it. I say, have fun with it. Take those dick pics, be glad knowing some guy at the NSA is looking at it. Make it..."interesting" for them :P	Kronos_Selai	t1_d8i1cqz

I thought they were supposed to be smart" syndrome).   &gt;The latter are too old to understand that this is like a direct line with a corporation that may or may not be compromised by the NSA will just see it as a practical way to interact with their computer. If you think about it from their perspective a computer is like magic (see /r/oldpeoplefacebook for examples) and this is just another layer of magic on top.  &gt;The former are so young that they don't give a shit about privacy because they have never not had this kind of toys, and they will just see this as an early version of Jarvis from Iron Man. They have grown up with a Google account and a Facebook account and a smartphone etc. and everybody already listening to them all the time.  https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/56afe7/google_home_will_give_amazon_a_run_for_its_money/d8hpymx?context=9	ZaneHannanAU	t1_d8hpva2

t3_56afe7	t1_d8iq1b5	1475891559	Don't pretend to know me and assume I'm willfully giving away my privacy and constitutional rights. I would absolutely love to see the day when the general populace gave a shit, but that simply will not happen unless people are informed and turn up to vote. As it is now, I have 2 choices.  1. I cut off all connections to the digital world. That would include things like Reddit, or basic email. No credit card, no going outside near any camera, no cellphone, etc. Yeah, I'm not living in the year 1900.  2. I accept the reality of the modern world and I try to limit exposure to things I deem harmful. I don't like Facebook for this very reason. I'm forced to keep it for a while longer, but the only info i dish out is my name and city.    Having an Echo is no more intrusive than having a cellphone. I talk to the echo, it listens and no doubt uses all the info I give it.  I have a cellphone, if I wanted, FBI could show up in mere minutes by saying stupid shit in proximity to the mic. I do NOT use facebook on my cell for this reason, as it does listen in to you. Google is considerably less evil than Facebook, and they already have all my info. I can't take that back, and I'm not going to sweat and worry over them knowing what I beat my meat to.   You have to weigh convenience with your privacy. I choose to find a balance. I mean, christ... you're typing this up right now on either a cell or a desktop/laptop.

I am logged into facebook. They track me on the internet, they track my personal life. I even have revealed damning evidence on Facebook chat. I accept all that for the benefits I receive from using facebook.  I could store and encrypt my files locally, I could share photos by driving to friends and showing them physically. I could write my messages with pgp. But I don't because of convenience. There's also other benefits I cannot participate in in any way. I can't be a part of the group chat between my buddies without facebook. I can't see photos of my relatives. Those services are hosted on facebook.  A phone or home automation hub that always listens is what I want because I am able to make my life a lot easier with voice control.

t3_566p26	t1_d8j8xr6	1475939230	This is entirely redundant if you use 3D Secure and have the user authenticate with their card provider on checkout.  Who actually needs a card like this? 60 minutes is a hell of a long time to rotate the code. Criminals will react by simply using your stolen card details faster.  Also I would bet that it's feasible to electronically detect what numbers are displayed on the card without looking at it or touching it. We already have the technology to see what's on a screen by the radio frequencies it leaks. This screen is just 3 digits - unless it is a Faraday cage it's probably going to leak.	tddp	t3_566p26
t3_566p26	t1_d8jceay	1475944692	Absolutely, but I didn't say get rid of CCs right away. Even these new CCs will take years to roll out and you'd have to expect the same of phones. Frankly the fact that people still don't have phones in the USA disgusts me anyway, it's essential to modern life. It's arguably a right all Americans deserve to have that connection. The people who can't afford phones, with the exception of some elderly people, have the least security risk because they live paycheck to paycheck and generally don't make as many purchases as a wealthier person would. My basic point is simply that scrolling numbers on a CC seems to be a nearly useless and redundant technology, and is becoming ever more so by the day. We should act on the expectation that someday soon everyone will have a phone. A great number of advancements humans have made are similar, and once upon a time it was said that the phone would never be more useful than perhaps a line to every town. Now everyone has on in their home, even the tremendously poor in the US, and there's no reason that they shouldn't have one in their pocket, especially if they're working. They both deserve and need it.	Iksuda	t1_d8iv44d

t3_566p26	t1_d8jl6tt	1475957679	I see your point. Mobile phones have become an integral part of the lives of essentially everyone on Reddit. It would be a long road before they could totally replace credit cards, for these reasons:  1) Not everyone has a mobile phone; b) Many cannot afford the cost of buying and using a mobile phone (I think many have become a bit desensitised to the amount we pay for them) iii) Not everyone here lives in the US, myself included. Maybe this plan could work in the States. In many parts of Australia, however, this would not.  I'm all for new technology, as long as no one is left disadvantaged by what is meant to be a step forward.	PonyKiller81	t1_d8jceay
t3_566p26	t1_d8jswav	1475969347	Yeah, I'm talking about the US particularly but I didn't think of the number of places besides the number of places besides extremely poor countries that might have this problem. Australia and the US may be alike to some extent though if you mean what I think you mean. It's a big place. Not everyone could use a cell phone even if they had one. It's true of the US too, it's a massive country and even I live somewhere I get an occasional signal if I'm lucky. Again though, I'm totally not saying we should just leave those people behind. The size and wealth of that demographic would mean that, should we begin to use cell phones to pay more, this card would be of very little real importance.	Iksuda	t1_d8jl6tt

My option's are,   **- Samsung 55 inch  - Sony 55 inch  - Panasonic 65 inch**  Now for the specifications and why I am confused about buying them.  - The picture quality of Sony and Samsung are very good but Panasonic is not at par. Most difference I have seen is in colour reproduction and a teensy bit in sharpness, although that can be alluded to se quality video on a bigger device ( 65 vs 55 inch)It's not a earth shattering difference, I think, but I don't know if it will make much difference. If the Sony and Samsung display is 100, then Panasonic is about 90. I am also assuming there is a minimal difference in sound quality but I cannot confirm.  - I want the biggest screen possible but also want an actual Smart TV ( Android TV maybe?) . Sony and Samsung are Smart TVs but Panasonic is not. It's just a simple Flatscreen with a remote and HDMI spot. Not much else. But then it is also 10 inches bigger than the others.  - Samsung is 2k display and the others are Full HD.  Other things-  - I am not at all willing to buy a Chromecast. It's just too expensive here for very little it performs.  - Panasonic TV may be a tad cheaper than others. Sony is the most expensive of the three. All are roughly about the same price, although I am not sure about the exact price any one of them is gonna cost me.  Thanks. Any input is appreciated.	svparty	t3_55mjtw

It's got a 2.1 and 1 A outputs on it and can almost fully charge my iPhone 5 3x before dying. It was also cheap as dirt too, like 8 American dollars with my Amazon prime discount.  If you're looking for something with more kick- Amazon essentials has a 16,000 mAh (this number might be wrong, but the capacity is still absurd) for 20 USD. It claims it can charge an IPhone 6 9x before dying, and if I didn't have a use for it I would have probably picked that one up when I bought my last one.	draco_venator	t1_d8dzjwv

t3_56q4f7	t1_d8li22k	1476074735	TL;DR  Samsung devices of all kinds are getting closer and closer to looking like Apple's designs with each generation, and now Samsung's newest tech is going to be evaluated by the Supreme Court to see if it indeed violates any of Apple's protected designs.  The article goes on to say that Apple has done this before in the past, taking huge chunks out of Samsung's profits in damage claims despite their devices then looking less like an Apple product than their new ones do now. It seems like Apple's just trying to whack the shit out of Samsung as a competitor and is attempting to monopolize the generic smartphone archetype, which is what Samsung hopes to argue against the damage suits.

t3_56q4f7	t1_d8lijc5	1476075612	Quoted directly from the article, this is literally what there are arguing about:  &gt;At issue were design patents for a black, rectangular, round-cornered front face; a similar rectangular round-cornered front face plus the surrounding rim, known as the bezel; and a colorful grid of 16 icons. Those three patents are what's being considered in the Supreme Court case.  They are not arguing about the innovation of a new technology or idea, they are simply arguing about the *looks* of a device. This is a fucking joke.	ComradEddie	t3_56q4f7

t3_56q4f7	t1_d8ljc52	1476077185	Samsung phones don't look anything like iPhones.   Unless you look at them as flat rectangles with rounded corners that have icons on a screen.   In which case ALL smartphones look like iPhones.	Whipit	t3_56q4f7
t3_56q4f7	t1_d8ljoez	1476077898	Could a ruling on a case like this potentially change patent law?	Beareagle1776	t3_56q4f7
t3_56q4f7	t1_d8ljowv	1476077929	To be fair, I think a lot of the appeal of both phones lies in the aesthetic of it. I prefer the  iPhone because it's simple with the icon grid - if Samsung offered the same, I'd probably switch eventually.	vampyrekat	t1_d8lijc5
t3_56q4f7	t1_d8ljyot	1476078529	Eh, Samsung saying this "stifles innovation" is odd. What it does is say "look, innovate your own darn look".	ConradGoodwin	t1_d8li22k
t3_56q4f7	t1_d8lk3e9	1476078821	What is important to you does not default to what should be relevant to everyone else. Which, interestingly enough, is one of the points that can be made about this whole ordeal.	Tim_Depp	t1_d8li0wt
t3_56q4f7	t1_d8lk5qk	1476078970	The patents are for a phone with rounded corners, a bezel, and a screen with 16 icons. If we give this design patent to Apple, it *will* stifle innovation. What sort of phone can you make without a bezel? Without rounded corners? Would a screen with a max of 3 icons wide or 5-6 icons wide be empty-looking/cluttered? When you're forced to create something with such ridiculous "design patent" rules, you are literally stifling innovation.  The fact that intellectual-property law professors are siding with Samsung on this is probably telling, and even more so when the only ones siding with Apple are huge design powerhouses who benefit from huge payouts from these "design patent" lawsuits.	pre4edgc	t1_d8ljyot
t3_56q4f7	t1_d8lkts3	1476080542	No I get that but at a fundamental level (and all the bros downvoting me for thinking that means I side with Apple can stop...) saying "you can't do this", means "you need to do something else".  Just because you or I can't think of something that doesn't fall under that guise, doesn't mean no-one can. Look at that gorgeous edge to edge screen Samsung came up with, I wouldn't have thought of that, but that is very different.	ConradGoodwin	t1_d8lk5qk
t3_56q4f7	t1_d8ll7or	1476081513	I feel like it would lead to a horrible precedent should we let it continue, however. What would stop them from having a design patent that indicates having a forward-facing camera placed somewhere above a screen? From having the speakers placed on the bottom of the phone next to the charging port? From having a single power button placed somewhere on one side of the phone?  At what point does a design patent stop protecting a design and start to prevent competition in a given sector?  Also, I feel like you're enabling a decent discussion and certainly don't deserve any downvotes, even if you're supporting a point of view that many don't agree with (myself included).	pre4edgc	t1_d8lkts3
t3_56q4f7	t1_d8llj3w	1476082360	Fyi I agree with your issues and don't support the patent suit.   I think those things you said would be much much harder for Apple (or anyone) to muscle in on mostly due to the fact that they are much longer standing features.   I'll be honest, when I saw the new Google pixel phone I did think "wow, that's an iPhone 6". I'd love for some new creativity to be injected into all of these companies.   Huawei, Samsung, new Google, iPhone, they all look the same. If it takes one company going "nah we own this look", to make that happen then I sort of maybe kinda support it.   Tldr: phone designers have gotten lazy, suit is douchey but may be a blessing.	ConradGoodwin	t1_d8ll7or

t3_56qtnd	t1_d8lv2oo	1476108945	Hey, I bought the Note when it first came out. I had been an iPhone user my entire life, so the change was welcome. When I saw the explosions I went and exchanged it and then waited for the new replacement phones. When they came out with the new version of the Note, I waited a week just to make sure they were all safe. So I go exchange my temporary phone to get it back, and now all these explosions are happening. I have the green battery symbol, I checked the serial number, Samsung says my phone is safe. But so were all the others that exploded. I want to give it back, but I'm not sure.  If you think I should, can you give me a few suggestions for other phones.

t3_56q4f7	t1_d8m08bc	1476116034	This is about the older phones though. And some (like Galaxy Ace) were pretty close to the iPhone look. That said, the patents seem to be really broad so I hope that nothing comes of it.	akstro	t1_d8ljc52

Nothing about the watch seems advanced or worth the money they are asking for, when for just slightly more you can get a real Smartwatch. Heck even their display looks like something ripped off a Tamagotchi.

While many people complain about their sleep, they still have the advantage of being able to lay down and go to sleep without having to calm their brains first. For others our brains are wrought with anxiety, madness and neural activity that no matter how tired the body is, the brain refuses to shut down. Silence at night is the enemy. We need white noise machines or music in the room. Or with the Dreampad from Integrated Listening Systems (iLs), music in our head.  Originally conceived to be a therapeutic tool to calm children with autism, the Dreampad was created to be a sleep aid for those with complex sleep difficulties. As someone who cannot shut down the spongy central processing facility in my skull, the Dreampad seems like a solid replacement for my white noise machine or the speakers across the room. The Dreampad is not a pillow with speakers in it, as I may have implied. Rather, it is a system of transducers that deliver music straight into your head through vibration.  Unlike headphones or posting speakers next to your bed, the Dreampad transducers pump the music right into your nervous system through vibrations to the inner ear. You can hear the music — it is not a sense of the music or a distant construct of music — it’s whatever music you are playing, just delivered a bit differently. This method triggers a response that kicks your brain into relaxation mode and helps calm the mind. That’s the intent at least.      Oppenheimer FundsVoice  By Land, Sea Or Air: A Closer Look At A Smart Supply Chain [Infographic]  Also see: Don’t Hit Snooze: How Your Alarm Clock Engenders Your Reality  There is a pocket with a 3.5mm jack in the pillow to jam your phone into, or you can order the optional Bluetooth receiver. Or plug in an extension cord to your tablet on the nightstand like I did. The Dreampad app has a selection of music, but there was no way I wasn’t going to play my own music.

It takes a lot to relax me. At night I pace and toss a baseball around while trying to focus my thoughts on not all the things. If you know me, you know that I may seem like the zen master on the outside, but can easily switch to a hyper focused madman. At night — alone — this is amplified by silence. I take meds to help me fall asleep but still need music or white noise to focus my brain on something other than the billion or so anxieties slapping my neurons around like they just pissed off Tommy DeVito.  Using the Dreampad was an adjustment. Usually I plug my tablet into some speakers on a nightstand, but have trouble finding the right volume. The Dreampad just flows that music into my head without worrying about volume. When I want to get lost in white noise instead, there are apps for that.At first it was a little strange, as I was used to music filling the room instead of in my head, but like Green Day becoming a political pop-punk band, I got used to it. The Dreampad was surprisingly calming; vibrational music snuck directly into your head is a comfort that I’ve been waiting for just as long as bath towel warmers. The Dreampad is like a bath towel warmer for your tired, anxiety ridden brain.  So did the Dreampad succeed in shutting my brain down for the night? Sure. It was definitely better than my white noise machine, which can often cause my brain to create auditory inferences with the ambient sound, making achieving sleep more difficult. The Dreampad certainly beats fussing with the volume on my speakers. The Dreampad delivery system for music was certainly better than the other two sources. Did I feel that it calmed me more than the others, or erased anxieties? Not entirely. I doubt it overrules or would replace the meds, for me at least, but I can see how it would be a great supplemental product for those faced with difficulty calming their brains at night.  While I was a bit skeptical of the Dreampad being more than a gimmick for listening to music while you sleep, there is some research from iLs that shows the company is at least not focused on the gimmick part.  Its PTSD study, autism study and parent blogger study have shown positive results. It should be noted the Dreampad is not marketed, nor claims to be, a medical device.  Integrated Learning Systems is no newbie to neurotechnology. The Denver-based company trains therapists and educators to combine iLs sound and movement therapy techniques with other interventions. It has trained over eight thousand professionals, some in service at pediatric hospitals of Stanford, Harvard, Duke and other outpatient clinics. The Dreampad is a consolidation of a lot of this research and a product that can reach a larger part of the population without the need for direct sleep therapy.  The Dreampad 26 (reviewed) is available in the iLs store for $179. The Dreampad app is available forGoogle Android and Apple iOS.  A review unit was provided by the manufacturer.

The Dreampad is a consolidation of a lot of this research and a product that can reach a larger part of the population without the need for direct sleep therapy.  The Dreampad 26 (reviewed) is available in the iLs store for $179. The Dreampad app is available for Google Android and Apple iOS.  A review unit was provided by the manufacturer.

t3_56qtnd	t1_d8os2qr	1476281673	I've got the LG G Watch R (the name is pretty shitty) and it's been pretty solid so far. But from what I've noticed, it doesn't really do anything to improve my life. Sure, it tells time and has a few interesting features, but it's entirely inferior to just using your phone.    If you're absolutely committed to getting a smartwatch, your options are the moto 360, moto 360 v2, samsung gears, lg g watch r (or urbane, same shit), asus zenwatch 2 or 3 (not out yet), huawei, the pebble round, fitbit blaze, fossil Q, and the horde of other ones.   You should focus on battery and form factor over anything else. The square smartwatches are kind of uncomfortable (depending on your wrist size / hand size, they get in the way of your movement), and look less like a watch and more like a tiny calculator. *All* smartwatches are actually pretty large, but the smallest on that list would be the pebble round ( I might be wrong though). If you have a tiny wrist like me, consider the huawei, moto v1, or pebble round.  Battery life for most watches is ~ 2 days, with the exception of the moto v1 and zenwatch 2 which are 1 day, and the zenwatch 3 and fitbit blaze which are more than 2 days (the zenwatch 3 needs to be tested first, though).   My personal recommendation would be the huawei, mostly because I like the way it looks.    As for tablets, I would actually recommend you pick up a netbook with a touchscreen instead. They've dropped to roughly a similar price point, and are way more versatile than a tablet.	ketseki	t1_d8mugse
t3_56qtnd	t1_d8ot6nd	1476283158	The pixel is a pretty decent looking flagship, but like most google products I wouldn't touch that for at least a month after release. LG has the G4/5 and the V10/20 (the V20 comes out later this month), which are all very good phones within that mid-high end range in terms of specs and price. The Samsung S series is exactly what you've already experienced, but slightly stronger. The s7 edge is the high end phone for samsung and has a slightly different look than the normal s7. The note 5 has characteristic unique stylus, but the size makes it kind of unwieldy.   I don't think there's anything that a mid level phone can't handle though, so getting a high end phone seems unnecessary. My recommendation would be an s6 edge (which for some reason is cheaper than the s6) or an lg G5. If you're looking for something larger, try the LG v10, wait for the V20, or go for the note 5.	ketseki	t1_d8orsat

I'd like to buy directly from Google instead of Verizon, but I'm worried about how Asurion would handle a claim if something happened.  Would they replace it with a Verizon version? I've never had to file a claim before.  I would be OK with the device protection right from Google, but it only works for a couple years and doesn't cover loss or theft. I'd also like to have a wifi hotspot every once in awhile, but I don't know how it works.  Do I need an unlocked bootloader for that so I don't have to pay Verizon for something else? I could live without the hotspot, it would just be handy to have.  The insurance issue is pushing me towards Verizon. Any help or advise is much appreciated.	red_0217	t3_56qtnd

t3_56q4f7	t1_d8qfu8i	1476376550	The real issue is that apple has been awarded patents that it shouldn't be allowed to register. That is all. Proof is in the fact that they have happily been suing for the last ten years to protect their "innovations" which are basic designs that had been in use for years prior to their own usage of them.  Some companies innovate and others patent the unpatented innovation of others. Apple is the latter.	Dodgerider26	t1_d8loex5
t3_56q4f7	t1_d8qfy3j	1476376685	No. Patent laws have to be challenged separately.

t3_56qtnd	t1_d8qi5fw	1476379369	I just bought a Moto 360 and I'm having a ton of issues with it. I will try to include them all in a proper sequence.  1) The device does connect via bluetooth, and notifications do show, but on the Moto 360 in settings, my phone doesn't show up. This isn't really a problem it's just confusing.  2) I noticed the above because the watch is only showing about half of the notifications (It sometimes doesn't show notifications for a certain app that shows notifications at other times) despite only having only 3 apps with notifications filtered off. This is while my phone is not in use.  3) The fit options don't work. My phone tracks Google Fit steps and such, but it doesn't sync to my watch even after 24 hours of constant use. The watch tracked 0 steps after 4 hours and randomly went up to 7 steps and stayed there. This is after walking about 6k in one day.  4) I selected the watch to use Motobody but after a few minutes it automatically switches to Google Fit (I did not click anything, and it once even happened while I was watching it check my heart rate)  5) Almost none of my phone apps show up in the start apps section. Some apps show up occasionally and randomly  6) Sometimes it sets my watch face to simple and when I go to settings no other faces are available. They become available again after some time...  I cannot find answers to these issues on other forums, and I have solved 6 issues that I was able to find including constant freezing, restarting by itself, etc.	J_The_Wizard	t3_56qtnd

t3_56qtnd	t1_d8ql9ss	1476383125	The general consensus on smart watches is that they're not worth it.

If you're big into IFTT programming on Android there are tricks you can do when connecting to Bluetooth etc. but other than that there's not much to do.  If you want one for the fitness tracking capabilities, you're better off getting a fitness tracker that can get notifications.	rtechie1	t1_d8mugse

I work offshore and from time to time I'm close to land and can get some 4g signal on my phone, if I stay outside the vessel,  If I go inside, to my cabin, this 4g signal goes straight to 3g and fluctuates a lot, even though outside the signal is great and I can download at 5mb/s, when I go inside is shitty, it gets to 5mb/s eventually but then it just drops to zero, then 100k, and so on..  I understand is shitty because the ship is a metal box and I'm inside it, so its understandable that it would fuck my signal up,  I'll go home again in November and I thought of buying a router for 4g sim cards, and I hope that with a router having better antennas that my phone I'll get a better signal, but until then I'd like to be able to use the fu**ing internet on my cabin,  So here is my question, do any of you guys know any gadget or homemade antennas or anything really, that can boost my phone signal?  Btw, I have a Moto X Play,  Thanks in advance,  PS.: If this is not the right subreddit or anyone knows a better one please let me know,  TL;DR.: Any tips to increase phone signal with homemade stuff, I work in a vessel and want better reception inside my cabin when close to a city.	hemplayee	t3_56qtnd
t3_57dnb7	t1_d8rix2f	1476436028	It's more than that. Their reputation took a hit too. For us who knows about phones and the fact that it probably won't happen again it's fine, but a lot of the uninformed public are now scared to buy Samsung phones. I'm willing to bet that the s8 will sell worse than the s7.	18981995	t1_d8rg5v5
t3_57dnb7	t1_d8rj9m6	1476437270	Indeed... I agree it sucks for them, and future revenue is probably impacted far more than current costs to fix it.  I still think they happen to make excellent hardware (phones or washers lol)   For the actual number of fires that have been reported vs how many phones are in the wild... I still don't think people should adopt "the sky is falling" line of thinking.    Any lithium powered device runs the risk of things like this happening.  I remember there was a brush up of the cheap chinese cells in Ecigs and vape devices suffered a similar scenario a while back.   Hell the washer they said explodes that I have... it's actually the best washing machine I've ever had. If it does happen to explode, samsung pays to fix everythign.  Personally I'm hoping they either do a buyback, or a swap for an equal unit. *shrugs*	MrNerd82	t1_d8rix2f
t3_57dnb7	t1_d8rjjem	1476438243	Maybe it will force them to make the s8's price point cheaper to entice more people back into the fold	Just_wanna_talk	t1_d8rix2f
t3_57dnb7	t1_d8rjwgu	1476439540	Good. Maybe they will go out of business and take their shitty phones with them.	sandyvag69	t3_57dnb7
t3_57dnb7	t1_d8rkad0	1476440888	Then you have to deal with people thinking that it's made of cheaper materials. The psychology of sales is what matters to them now.	XxVelocifaptorxX	t1_d8rjjem
t3_57dnb7	t1_d8rkd2d	1476441139	They do, plus $100 towards a new one.	CelestialSnake	t1_d8rj0ob
t3_57dnb7	t1_d8rkfd4	1476441353	Unless they address this mess at the same time as they introduce a lower price point. A sort of apology coinciding with a price drop. Or even offer a free upgrade for those that bought the faulty device.	supamon	t1_d8rkad0
t3_57dnb7	t1_d8rkhjk	1476441552	It's hard to say what the right call is (pun intended)  I think in a perfect world they'd keep the next iteration at the same price point and try to appease the 'let us replace our battery' people, and probably add in a bit more to the package. They'll probably back down from advertising until the reviews start rolling in, and then finally everything should resume as normal if the phones don't- well, light people on fire anymore.	XxVelocifaptorxX	t1_d8rkfd4
t3_57dnb7	t1_d8rkrck	1476442400	I'm not really scared. I just have always thought of Samsung phones as these half assed spec whores that look good on paper, but delivers a terrible user experience.   Their Android is full of bloatware and it's buggy af.    Being prone to explosions makes me distrust how they go about producing these things.   I got a short fuse with phones. I need things to work. I'd rather have stable phone with worse specs than a buggy phone that is a powerhouse on paper. iOS is almost free of bugs and have been so for every iteration. Haven't tried pure Android yet, but I'm kinda on the fence for Pixel. Maybe I'll wait for the next Pixel phone.	crashing_this_thread	t1_d8rix2f
t3_57dnb7	t1_d8rkucu	1476442654	I hope so too. This hasn't swayed me from buying another Samsung phone. They are the best.  iPhone 7 = Haha, iOS? Nope.  Google Pixel = 99% advertising, 1% phone.  LG V20 = Specs are acceptable, aesthetics are not.	tmogmo	t1_d8r7lzq

t3_57dnb7	t1_d8royxo	1476451655	The email app and calendar. Both Gmail and Outlook (I use Exchange through my work) SUCK compared to the email app on the note 4. I'm sure I'll "get used to them" with time, but email threads don't display well, embedded photos don't always work (come through as attachments), and more. The calendar app also isn't as nice, although that's mostly me getting used to the appearance rather than any loss of features. Some may consider it bloat ware, but the note came with "Samsung health" pre-installed which was great. I really only used the pedometer, but it did a good job of tracking my activity levels. I was able to install Google fit on my s60, and it works well enough, but the pedometer doesn't seem as accurate? It's definitely a lot harder for me to do something like view a historical time-line of steps per day since it wants to break things into "workouts" (half of which are my GPS malfunctioning and me spending 4 hours walking through my neighbors yards in geometric shapes around my house). I opened fit to write this comment, and I'm watching the pedometer go up while it's sitting flat on my desk so that's fun. So nothing earth shattering but I generally miss Samsung.	paracelsus23	t1_d8rn91c
t3_57dnb7	t1_d8rplrz	1476452656	Granted shitty companies do exist I still don't think they should take it out on the employees as collective punishment.

t3_572egt	t1_d8s2m6b	1476469104	totally agree that the percentage of exploded notes was minuscule, but does anyone else find it odd that such a high percentage of the explosions happened on planes? is there some correlation between note owners and spending excessive amounts of time flying?   also @tioznerdo, they could do that, but that doesn't explain the problem. imagine if they had a few explode in your experiment. what's the conclusion? "using it" causes it to explode? how about the 2.99999 million Notes that didn't explode? not to mention all of the other models that don't explode. they have to be more systematic.	ocelotofdeadbodies	t1_d8pz3vm

But since it's a 6 month old phone (ancient tech) and the new s8 or whatever the hell they'll call it now will be coming out should I wait for it or buy a s7 edge? I'm not an iphone guy by any means and use it for basic stuff and my note is my daily driver. I'm also a Samsung fanboy (I know, not a good time to make claims like these) and haven't touched a nexus or a lg ever. I love the features they provide with the spen and other things.

t3_57nat3	t1_d8uehdr	1476633215	for over a thousand dollars, you can get a normal laptop with a gpu and i7. You are paying over an extra $500 just so the laptop is the tiniest bit lighter and smaller, which I don't think it is worth it. a $500 laptop isn't that heavy to begin with.	poochyenarulez	t1_d8ue35e
t3_57nat3	t1_d8uene0	1476633477	I'd appreciate a link, please. Also, what's your definition of a "normal" laptop? Is it a laptop that's almost an inch thick?  If you're still buying those types of laptops and you haven't tried living with an ultrabook, then that would go a long way towards explaining why you think an ultrabook isn't worth a few extra hundred dollars to save weight and space.	magus-21	t1_d8uehdr
t3_57nat3	t1_d8uh5la	1476637268	I do believe the price is alright for the specs. Considering this has 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, a latest-gen ULV CPU and a 1080p IPS display.  Your typical $500 laptop will have a less efficient CPU, spinning mechanical hard drive and a crappy 1366x768 TN display, be made out of creaky plastic and likely have a worse battery life.  You have to look at the whole package, not just CPU/GPU performance. I believe the price is in line with the rest of the market for that hardware.	p_giguere1	t1_d8u5vfk

t3_56q4f7	t1_d8vfhmv	1476687495	Literally patenting rounding corners or having a grid of icons is too broad and generic a patent. It's akin to patenting round wheels or curved panels on a car - it's simply an obvious and optimal solution.  Apple can't be allowed to force every competitor to have arbitrarily differentiated design choices for what is the basic framework of a phone.  The point of the patent process is to reward genuine investment and innovation, not to allow someone to take something generic and hold an industry hostage. It's fine for Apple to have unique features and protect the look of some of those features, but it can't be to the point where no one else can make something that looks like a phone.  I don't think forcing competitors to add sharp corners or only have plastic cases would genuinely represent innovation protection. It's not exactly a bold idea to make a case out of metal, can your really say only one company can use entire elements?	celestiaequestria	t1_d8lkts3

t3_57w37a	t1_d8z9m0d	1476909015	Hi everyone!  I need help finding a good phone. I am a male, live in the USA, and I got big hands. I currently use a Note 3 but it has been giving me issues, example I can't use the GPS as it gets stuck thinking I am not moving... and since I am new to this city I end up lost. I would like some recommendations, I looked into the OnePlus3 and the iPhone SE. My significant other has an iPhone 6s and I would like to be able to comunicate with her easier plus our parents have iPads... but I hate Apple phones. I also don't know how long the SE will be supported with updates and I wonder if my hands will be too lare for this phone. As for the OnePlus3 I think it is a good size phone, it is at a good price and I can get the guarantee for 24 months just for 80 bucks which is awesome, but a lot of people don't like it and I fear that it will not be what I aspect. I have been an android person for about 6 years and about 2 years with apple. Budget is about $500 for a phone... let me know if you have any ideas. Thank you!	FullMetalSoulHunter	t3_57w37a

t3_588dw2	t1_d8zd5v2	1476913145	It is funny that a company who makes such a huge profit margin is so arrogant when it comes to supplying their consumer base with half-way decent technology.

t3_58czk4	t1_d8zgh4l	1476917382	Well.. "twice as much RAM" is a pretty useless metric.  The iPhone 7 has 2GB. That's really plenty. An application is rarely going to use over 300mb, or maybe 500mb, and you don't multitask very hard on these devices.  What's more important is a powerful and efficient CPU and GPU.  Thought it does feature a Snapdragon 821 which should have an Adreno 530. Same that the Google Pixel has. That's quite good, really.	sadtaco-	t3_58czk4

t3_57w37a	t1_d90q7wm	1476991416	I'm on Verizon Wireless, and my wife and I need new phones. While I don't know if any of you can answer questions about the plan so I don't have to call them, this question is about phones: we need new ones. I have a Galaxy S4 and my wife an S3. The battery is going on my phone, and I hate the keyboard; it won't let me disable Swipe, the emojii shortcut is annoying as fuck, and the typing isn't super accurate (I have smaller hands). Not sure if a new phone can fix this.  Anyway, I want to stay with Android. My top choices are Pixel XL, S7/Edge, and Moto Z. Despite the size, I'm leaning towards bigger phones (e.g., Pixel XL) for better battery life. While we're both 30 and technically millennials, we don't fit the typical millennial typeset of being constantly glued to our phones. We probably use the phones for calls more than anything, but an approximate ranking of what we use the phones for is: phone/text (tie), email/taking photos (tie), web browsing/reddit (she doesn't reddit), navigation, everything else. I use Google Now a lot (oftentimes to do one of the aforementioned things), but I think any of the phones I listed would do a good-enough job at that.  I'm leaning most towards the Pixel. I know people are whining that it's premium-priced without premium hardware, but honestly the software seems like where most of the cost is coming from. I'm clumsy with my phone so while the glass on the back is worrying, I'll probably get some sort of case for it (even if I'd rather not).   Buying the phones outright isn't an option for me; I can't justify spending $1200+ (upfront) for new phones that'll probably wear out in a year or two, though if I'm understanding the new Verizon plans right I might be able to upgrade more frequently without a lot of added cost	CaptInsane	t3_57w37a

t3_58czk4	t1_d914bz1	1477010790	Phones (generally) use LPDDR RAM - the LP stands for low power.

I saw on the internet some tricks with a shoe box and foil paper.. but it didn't work for me (I probably did it wrong);  Unfortunatly the terminals I usually go to are not close to a big city, because if it was I could go ashore and buy myself a 4g router with huge antennas and stop having this issue..

The only slowdown I face in my 150 USD off contract Redmi 3 Pro is on games, so if I have Switch, obviously it's good enough for my needs. If you're in US where carrier subsidized phone are common, a decent one like BLU R1 HD can be had for less than $50, this kind of phone should be good enough for non-gaming purposes.  Now I personally don't find the need for playing console, so I pick a good enough phone for casual gaming on the go and fill the itch for FPS &amp; RTS on my laptop. For someone who actually relish consoles, especially Nintendo libraries, it's no brainer, they may even forgoes laptop/phone upgrade to save for Switch.  Doesn't matter how fast is your smartphone, there's no way it can compete with Nintendo game libraries. People still play old games in their console/PC because of the gameplay, not because of how many pixels are moving around.  As always, there's the [third](http://www.gpdxd.com/) option of getting cheap portable game emulators with physical control where you get the portability, full libraries of semi-legal 90s era console games, all for $150.	martheen	t3_58k03t

It consumes resources. A lot. Perpetually. To the point I think having 2 smartphone, one for normal stuff and other for "game only", is more practical.  2.The best game I have played on my nexus 7(2012) is MACHINE KNIGHT (kemko). And it is mostly gba style graphics. And still have some frame drops. You have to turn off wifi to load games faster. Adventure Capitalist takes 1 minute to load. I can't participate on events because it just crashes. And my Nexus 7 is supposed to have way more stronger hardware than a PSP.  3.Touch only controller sucks for many kind of games. Platformers is umplayable. I would like the smartphones have physical buttons like XPERIA PLAY or Shield. &gt;You can bluetooth regular console controller and special controller for smartphone.  It's half-ass compared to nintendo switch and way more inferior than 3DS. You have to sync every fucking time the controller to play it because you have to turn sync off in order to maintain battery longer. Nintendo switch have to do so but it would take less time since it has only to deal with games. 3DS is just pick up and play.  You know what? If I had money, I would buy an laptop and Nintendo Switch. Smartphone stuff for gaming is the worst of both PC and console world.	ntbxp	t3_58k03t

But you are right... if somebody's going to pay $3000 for this thing I'm sure they will be happy to adapt to the misalignment.  I think they should've gone all-out by using an ultra-wide display, centered keyboard, and trackpad on the right-hand side. For $3000… Hell put a trackpad on the other side too.

t3_58ob5n	t1_d92bzxj	1477086154	This looks.. weird. I'd much rather preferred it be like a normal Razor Blade - thin and seemingly unpowerful, but a monster inside. The touchpad on the right just looks weird to me.	keyboardical	t3_58ob5n
t3_58k03t	t1_d92hfn8	1477094994	I have to agree with you on the Smartphone gaming. I have poured countless hours trying to get my phone configured enough to where it's at least comfortable to play some games. Even then, it's a kind of 50-50 whether or not the game will actually work with the controller or even detect it at all.  Portable devices do a better job at gaming when they're designed for gaming. Spending more time trying to get things to play games rather than playing said games is not worth it. At all.	Psilli	t1_d91okic
t3_58ob5n	t1_d92hj3g	1477095149	It appears that the trackpad is actually a touchscreen, and you can program it to be whatever you want, including a number pad.  There's a picture in [this article](http://laptops.reviewed.com/content/razer-blade-pro-17-laptop-review).	FrancisHC	t1_d925qog

t3_58czk4	t1_d92hp0p	1477095414	It's more about the people than the companies. For example Apple fanboys piss themselves like happy dogs when a new apple product is released even if a similar one or better one already exists on the market. And then many journalists and everyday joes compare products to Apple products as if it is an industry standard. They do not do that with cars.. Why not.	Jokesonyounow	t1_d92f782
t3_58ob5n	t1_d92jw0y	1477099323	Remember, someone's gotta figure out how to cram all that stuff in a laptop. You're not doing that yourself, and you're not getting this from anyone else. We call that an engineering premium.	JaredWsSb	t1_d91zumv

t3_58k03t	t1_d92nnsn	1477106480	I think it was the same one that they used on their shield tablet.   And that is the most powerful tablet processor tho. I don't think it will be the exact same, maybe more powerful?	Renato_Lopes	t1_d92ng95

t3_58k03t	t1_d92ogay	1477107983	It would be very nice if this gpu was as or more powerful to the shield, although I could see that having a detrimental effect on the battery. I guess everything portable has trade offs tho, but I hope the battery life is pretty good on the switch.	alahu	t1_d92nnsn
t3_58k03t	t1_d92ox46	1477108930	pretty sure they could add a more powerful battery right? I once saw a phone with fucking 10.000mh of battery.	Renato_Lopes	t1_d92ogay

t3_58s4ir	t1_d936o0r	1477155338	Considering Nintendo's past history with offering backwards compatibility, I'm sure they would have made this backwards compatible if they reasonably could. However, considering the big change in hardware architecture (powerPC to ARM) as well as a change in physical media, there's no reasonable way to offer backwards compatibility.  The GameCube to Wii to Wii U generations all used the same hardware architecture. Therefore Nintendo offered backwards compatibility (which I used greatly).	mathteacher85	t1_d936gir

t3_58k03t	t1_d93nt3d	1477182597	Depends on personal preference. It would have more battery life but be heavier. Nintendo is pretty good at this tho. I remember reading that the ds lite had a 20h battery life and about a 1Ah battery. That's pretty amazing imho, so hopefully Nintendo can do something like that with the switch.	alahu	t1_d93mlo8
t3_58s4ir	t1_d93t5ds	1477191084	They are probably going to release digital versions of all the games that aren't on it.	KingKrisspyKream	t3_58s4ir
t3_58s4ir	t1_d93u5uj	1477192845	That would be the dumbest decision Nintendo ever made. Almost all Nintendo 's games are more of the same thing, Mario, starfox, metroid, etc.  But old fans enjoy those games and they are likely to be the early adopters. I still remember buying the original DS at launch and spend the first 6 month play GBA games on it. If there is no back compatibility, whose gonna buy it at launch? To play the 10 launch games? It will be wiiu all over again.	owenhehe	t3_58s4ir

t3_58s4ir	t1_d93vm0k	1477195425	I never understood why these console makers don't throw a line out to the better emulator communities?  Say "hey guys, you're using our IP illegally but we have gone over your coding and it seems pretty good.  How about coming to work for us and get this console backwards compatible making this piece of hardware the best it can be?"  But then again you would be giving the exact blueprints on the new machine and all its in and outs to the "enemy" or people that have already thumbed their nose to the IP laws to begin with so I can see why they would be hesitant	RobotJiz	t1_d93jp9k
t3_58s4ir	t1_d93vr38	1477195691	But they decided to go with cartridges.  The cost, and durability of memory has dropped so low that discs seem old news.  I kind of like the cartridge.  You can add more capabilities to a game like the 3D chip for Star Fox for the SNES.	RobotJiz	t1_d934xcg
t3_58s4ir	t1_d93vthh	1477195818	UMD.  Never understood why they didn't use minidisc as the format instead of a completely new format.  I still have a minidisc player around here and people don't even know what it is.	RobotJiz	t1_d92usb3

t3_58s4ir	t1_d93yagf	1477201089	Don't get me wrong, I like the cartridges too. I'm just pointing out that Nintendo's normal stance is to include backwards compatibility when they can reasonably do so.

t3_58s4ir	t1_d9431z9	1477216932	Yeah, the prices are very steep on these consoles.  Thats the overpriced amount you pay for proprietary hardware.  Sometimes PSN has flash sales to go along with the famous Steam sales, but Steam and Humble have really spoiled me as to what to expect from a digital game sale.

The last Nintendo system I've had was the GameBoy Advance SP, and I've had frequent access to my friend's Wii (which he sold sadly), after that I never had reason to go for Nintendo again (in too deep with PS and PC)	ddgamer83	t3_58s4ir
t3_58s4ir	t1_d949aew	1477234025	Yeah, but like Stan Lee said, in comparison to a boob, he'd rather hold a comic book than just see it be there.   The only drawback is the DRM applications of it, they could take away your games anytime.

t3_588dw2	t1_d94nwyv	1477254234	What non-Apple users always miss are the numerous features that are added with every free OS X upgrade, amazing customer service and support, the ingenuity of the little things that other devices don't have (Handoff, Instant Hotspot, AirDrop to name a few).   Btw, those OS X upgrades have been free for years and the current newest macOS supports devices as far back as 2008/2009. You can call in about 99% of issues and receive world class support (as in First in customer service in the world 5 years running).   Oh Windows 10 is free? That's cute, too bad it was practically a forced upgrade and turned 3 year old PCs to junk. These upgrades bring new features to years old Macs. So instead of forcing you to buy a machine every other year, just upgrade macOS. Sierra has my 2012 MacBook Pro running like new.   How much is Office? Well that sucks too since Pages, Numbers, Keynote among several other productivity and creativity apps come with every new Mac and the digital license is linked to your Apple ID for life so you can always update these apps and reinstall them to other Macs you own.   I could go on and on, but you get the picture. Yea the price is premium but so are all the 'extra' benefits.	iphoneguy321	t1_d90cty2
t3_58s4ir	t1_d94pes3	1477256224	Holy crap, I just got an epic idea! What if the switch is the last nintendo console? All you need to do is include a gpu and cpu inside the game cart, then you wont need to ever buy a new console! Terrible idea on nintendo's side due to the fact that people won't need to buy another console = Less money for nintendo. Also it would be very hard to implement due to the small size of the cart. It would be the bane of battery life TBH.  Still fun to speculate though.	John117HALO	t1_d93vr38
t3_588dw2	t1_d94thzd	1477261931	I had been trying to buy a Mac for my friend for a year but it never got upgraded and he finally gave up. All of your points are fine for someone who doesn't need the latest computer. Like I said before: Apple is geared toward non power users and grandmothers who need an easy computer; it always has been. Apple has spent way more R&amp;D on the iPhone before the Mac because it makes way more money through sales, so why satisfy a demand that isn't there? As Lucky Palmer has said, he won't put VR on a Mac until they stop making low-powered computers. If you're ok with that, and only plan to use Pages and Safari, then spend spend spend away:  http://www.shacknews.com/article/93547/oculus-palmer-luckey-will-consider-mac-support-if-apple-ever-releases-a-good-computer	strangeattractors	t1_d94nwyv
t3_58s4ir	t1_d94wa9a	1477266040	What if the switch is already future proofed by design.  Think about it.  The tablet that holds all the processing power can be upgraded down the road.  Nintendo keeps the software/instruction set the same, but that tablet can get bigger in any direction except thicker.  It's pretty good thinking downgrading the res to 720 when it's popped out of the stand(if that's true).  With that size your not going to be noticing graphics.  If Razer can put an i7 and discrete GPU into its super slim laptop then Nintendo won't have a problem at all.	RobotJiz	t1_d94pes3

[ It's either 128 bit/DDR3 or 64bit/ddr4, to get the 25.6GB/s from the spec list ]  To put that into perspective it's a bit like something between the GT930M and GT940M, closer to the former.

Sony hasn't had good drivers at this price range since they discontinued the MDR-MA900.

t3_598e4f	t1_d96t631	1477386679	Might happen, I'll just go take it to service and get it changed. Saves me some time over doing it myself (backcover is glued supposedly but possible to take off) and even a couple hundred to solve that problem for another year is no big deal considering how nice this phone feels every day.

t3_598e4f	t1_d96uwvr	1477392564	I mean, it depends. If you're one of the people that trade up every generation, or even every other generation, you likely won't be experiencing problems like that before it's time to trade up anyway. Sure, if you want to be able to use the same phone for years on end, I think that's a perfectly acceptable criteria to have a removable battery. But myself, I won't need a new battery before I get a new phone so I much prefer built in fast charge, wireless charge, waterproofing, and aesthetic to the the convenience of a removable battery	DigThatFunk	t1_d96rt5h

t3_58s4ir	t1_d97vr8l	1477444588	Interesting thought. TBH consoles are a major bottleneck to pc, (Holding developers back to the hardware limitations of consoles, when pc can handle it no sweat, i.e map size, gameplay, etc) so therefore, if consoles become upgrade able and are marketed as pcs that are easier to set up and manage (I'm thinking of implementing upgrades with snap on parts that connect to the motherboard via port, or maybe NFC?) developers won't have to hold back their game's full potential due to hardware limitations, of course if your console doesn't have enough firepower, there may be a graphic settings menu like pc games have. We already see Nintendo is leaning towards mobile gaming, and this is great. I am worried about price, but most devices with tegra's in them retail at about 200 - 300 USD, which is WAY less than the scorpio, so thats quite good considering those have windows on them (+100USD) so the switch will be probably the same price as Xbone or PS4.

I think this was made for people who play lots of games. (Previous commenter mentioned that this off-center design would improve game ergonomics.)   I'm just an IT professional that uses a laptop for development and design all day. (Not the target user.) But, I'm still attracted to the hardware specs and unconventional design that was put into this laptop. I like seeing this kind of stuff on the market.	grokcodile	t1_d97ob2d

A big part of Apple's appeal is the ease of use and lack of issues with both their hardware and software. Bring that to Windows, which they've already begun with their own hardware, and you'll have proper competition with Apple.  Especially now that they're marketing to the design crowd, which the Studio is definitely directly aimed at.  Or they could partner with a handful of quality software developers for entry-level design program suites on Surface devices.

The Cintiq is not portable but it is a workhorse along with my MacBook. The Surface Pro is for doodling and fucking around. I love it for that, but I find it clunky (problems with software, updates, crashing and freezing). I am much more familiar with working on OSX, which in my opinion is better for design softwares.

t3_57nat3	t1_d9am1kb	1477606388	I don't think there's an "official" one per se, but the MacBook Air is the prototypical ultrabook. The XPS 15 is probably thin enough, but it's almost 5 lbs. I'd say ~3 lbs is the heaviest a laptop can be to still be considered an ultrabook, since that's the weight of the first MacBook Air, and that's what every other ultrabook has pegged itself against. Also, 15-in laptops are generally not considered ultrabooks because of their screen size, anyway. Ultrabooks are generally 13-in and smaller.  To give you an idea, the Retina MacBook Pro 13-in is not really considered to be an ultrabook because it's 3.5lbs. Some people might consider it an ultrabook, but it's definitely on the bigger/heavier side of what ultrabooks can be.	magus-21	t1_d9aluyn

In my opinion, it's better than iOS and Android (I haven't used Blackberry or Firefox OS, so can't compare against those) in terms of how intuitive, easy-to-use and appealing the UI was, right down to the well-defined design language.

t3_59t192	t1_d9bky67	1477671360	It's obviously a matter of taste but I have to disagree.  I didn't find the layout or design of Windows Phone appealing at all, the UI was unintuitive compared to a modern Android (or iOS but I haven't used that in a long while so I can't really weigh in on that). The settings didn't "feel" like they belonged in the categories they were put in etc.  I'm not a huge fan of the Metro (not sure what it's called now) design for everything which would have certainly played a part in forming my opinions but the whole experience just didn't feel right for me.  I agree with the app thing though, that is definitely the biggest reason that the phones didn't do so well.	schmuelio	t1_d9bdymj

t3_59t192	t1_d9bof9j	1477675553	Fair enough and, yeah, liking the visual design is very subjective.   I too can only speak from my own experiences. My mum had a Samsung Galaxy (an S2, IIRC) which she used to use strictly for phone calls and to take photos. Then she moved to a Windows Phone once she saw mine. And her usage dramatically changed. Next thing I know she's emailing me attachments, sending me things on WhatsApp, customising the look and feel of her phone, whatnot. She found the phone so much easier to use that the value of a smartphone (to her) changed.

t3_59t192	t1_d9cx4o8	1477761083	Yeah it's about on par with the 13" MBP, depending on the exact model.  It's faster than the base model 13" MBP, which has a Skylake 15W Core i5, but slower than the top model 13" MBP, which has a 28W Core i7.  On the GPU side, a 13" MBP with integrated graphics is better than a Surface Book with integrated graphics (since it uses Iris graphics aka GT3e), but compared to a Surface Book with discrete graphics then the Surface Book is obviously better.  Microsoft claimed the Surface Book is 3x faster than a 13" MBP but that's a little misleading. That's only true of GPU performance, if you compare a (significantly more expensive) SurfaceBook with dGPU to a MBP with iGPU. That comparison is now outdated too as they used last year's MBP for comparison. This year's MBP (with ~75% better graphics) was announced literally the day after Microsoft's keynote.	p_giguere1	t1_d9cwxpw

Samsung issued a "replacement program" because they didn't want to  issue an official formal recall which would have brought the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission into the fold and would have made it illegal to sell any more Note 7's.   Basically the US Government stepped in and forced Samsung's hand. It's called Thermal Runaway and tt's 600 degrees C which translates to 1,110 degrees F.	nerd0001	t1_d9cz3ev

Apple overcharges on additional parts to make money, it's just normal business practice for a lot of companies not just Apple.  Because of this most people use loopholes to getting discounts but this option isn't available to just everyone.

They fired the entire Nook division along with their tech departments to save costs and outsource any future iterations of the Nook. It will likely be a tablet manufactured by a 3rd party with Nook branding if they do anything at all. Similar to how they did their last lign with Samsung.  However, this was a few months ago when they had someone else at the head of the company. The board forced him to resign and the founder stepped back in as CEO. With his re-entry they started adding "restaurant" additions to some stores in-place of the Cafés. The company was not and still seems to be in a pretty poor position.	Kurcide	t1_d9dcrdm

t3_592vwn	t1_d9dsb70	1477819489	For me it didn't justify the price increase over the Bose QC 35's  Granted I only had about half an hour to test them but they didn't feel as comfortable, I didn't like the touch controls and noise cancelling seemed identical to the Bose.  They did marginally sound better but again, (for me) not enough to justify the price increase. Still not audiophile quality.  Looks wise I preference the Bose over the Sony's.  Construction, you get metal with the Sonys but also means they're a little heavier, though it's not that drastic it's still noticeable.  All in all, I got the QC35's and I'm happy with them. If the Sonys were the same price as the Bose, it would have been much closer though I think I would have still gone for the Bose. I really liked the clicky controls on the Bose opposed to that touch nonsense and the noise cancelling was identical. The physical buttons on the Sonys were so hard to find and press for me.  I don't think I would have used the extra features on the Sony often either. And when someone's talking to me I'd rather take the headphones off than put my hand over the right ear cup.  Great pair of headphones, gives Bose a run for its money but for £40 more I think the Bose is still the better buy unless you really need those features.	Ryowxyz	t3_592vwn

I got given a straight talk, Android powered, ZTE, Unico, LTE most awesome phone I've ever had. The model has been discontinued BTW. Or I'd have bought another.   The phone stopped charging. Sporadically.  Sometimes would, most times wouldn't. Yes, I tried the plethora of diff cables, charging ports, outlets. Yes I tried it all.   Went to Wally world. I needed the same phone (right size for hand, can wear on belt at work for quick whateva's).  Discontinued model.   They sent me to battery plus. There I was told battery fine, go to Boost place to check the charging port.   I go to Boost. After 30 minutes of listening to Trump/ Pence insanity, I was told the charging port cannot be fixed, because it isn't a separate thing, it is connected to the whole contraption.   Please someone, please, tell me there is some secret voodoo fix for this. Any help is greatly appreciated.  The phone was perfect for me, my hand (carpal issues) and I need it on my job.   Any help I will be so grateful for. It's a freaking charging port. Surely a plan for fixing was RIE'ed into the possible mess of what could go wrong.   Thanks guys/gals.

So going PC. Who should I be buying from (in the UK)?  And any recommended specs (want something very quiet, ideally utterly silent and while I don't do anything fancy in 3D, other than the odd sketch up design, would be nice to have an option to buy into VR at some point...) my budget is around £1k (or a little more-don't need screen/don't need keyboard/mouse) and my preference is for solid build quality.

There's nothing that feels like a real clear upgrade, especially in the ~1,000 dollar price range.     Maybe I'd end up with a fully loaded iPad, or this or a MBr.   Moving to Windows would be a really painful experience, especially losing iMessage as it's the only thing that can reliably reach me at work since social networks are blocked on the wifi and the cell signal is bad.  None of the Apple solutions seem like a clear win at this point, I just have to hope my MBA lasts until the dongle life seems less painful and hopefully they can move the prices back down as new designs tend to slowly go down market a bit.	andyster	t3_59ziwz

t3_59ziwz	t1_d9ein8l	1477866050	Data has shown that people with touch screen laptops don't use them. At all.   And if you think apple is a rip off and dell isn't then you are in a dream world. Apple offer world class support. They provide updates that usually outlast the machines and their products are proven to be built to the highest standards. Dell offer the most hideous support. They use cheap off the shelf parts and their machines are made to the lowest standards they can get away with.   People buy apple not because they innovate. They don't buy them because they are sheep. They buy them because apple has shown time and time again that their products are the best. And more often than not, the outlay far outweigh the overall cost in comparison to others.	slartibartfastr	t1_d9dkno7
t3_59ziwz	t1_d9ejgzg	1477867209	Dell used to be cheap and nasty but they've come a long way.  I got a Dell XPS for an excellent deal ($650) and it was okay.  To be fair, US brands like Dell, HP have come a long way.  I'm currently using a HP Spectre x360 and for $900 it is the best laptop I've ever owned.   I've been in the technology,IT and educational space all my life and unfortunately for you I have never owned a single Apple product for a number of reasons that still remains today:  - overpriced  - technologically behind  - restrictive  I was already using an MP3/AVI phone, I didn't need an iPod or an iPhone.  I already had a 1080p screen on my laptops, I didn't need to wait for years for Apple to make one.  I already had a touchscreen on my laptops, again I didn't need to wait for Apple to make a touchscreen laptop.  So in essence, why do I or anyone else need to wait for Apple for anything?	sanjugo	t1_d9ein8l

Sure, they may have similar specifications - but the form factor of the Surface Book along with the utility of the pen gives it an entire world of capability absent in the Mac.  Doing residential energy audits for a few years, I honestly can't tell you how uniquely useful and versatile that device was.  That's not to hate on Macs - I'm quite the fan of how their laptops are put together, and I think the GUI of OSX is vastly superior to that of Windows (the file explorer particularly) - but a Macbook really isn't in the same kind of category as a surface.  You'd need to look at devices like the Yoga tablets, Inspiron 7000 15, Transformer Book Pro, etc. to make a more apt comparison.	John-Carlton-King	t3_59t192

However, I have never used or seen a cromecast before so I have a little doubt.  You use your phone to stream the video to the chromecast, right? How does that video get 4k as my phone's display isn't 4k.  And why does the chromecast have an ethernet option if the streaming is done by the phone? Does it have a built in interface for apps and such?	ItsAWrapParty	t3_5aayfn

t3_5aayfn	t1_d9f69a6	1477911858	I think the way chromecast works is that is retrieve the video from the internet and plays it. So when you pick a video from YouTube or Netflix on or phone and cast it, chromecast goes to YouTube or Netflix and streams the video from there. So you can turn ur phone off when you start a video and the video will still play.	AmenR	t1_d9f3vnr

t3_5aayfn	t1_d9g0a7f	1477951636	Here in the US most use TI and HP calculators so dont see much of Casio and dont know too much about the differences.  I honestly wouldn't worry about it too much. These are all fairly inexpensive and will not have all the functions that your current calculator probably can do. You can probably get by with just the basic one. I think the only differences would be the display, memory, and functions that you will never use.  Just going by sequential number I'm assuming the 83 might have a few more functions than 82 and the 85 might have a few more than 83. Again, these are probably functions you wont use anyways.   Edit: I think the ES means it's supposed to be for electronics (complex number support), and MS is for any other application (statistical calculations), basically more general version.  Not sure what the others are, but if it's general it really wont matter.  Here in the US the books required for each class can cost in the hundreds of dollars. A separate $15 calculator for each class would be reasonable in comparison.	evilr2	t1_d9f9dec

t3_5aayfn	t1_d9hagl5	1478030138	Looking for advice on bluetooth tracker that can use geofencing:  Where I work we have some iPads that customers use occasionally. We want to set up some sort of geofencing tracker to alert us if they go outside the premises. Our locations are very small, so standard bluetooth is probably fine.  Some preliminary searching has brought the XY3 tracker to my attention. It seems to be one of the better ones that does geofencing.  If anyone has any experience with the XY3, I'd love to hear your take on it.  I also am specifically wondering if there is a way to make the tile beep if the iPad goes out of the area (that way we don't need to have someone with the app on their phone at the desk and can instead keep a tile at the desk, if that makes sense.)	mbush42	t3_5aayfn
t3_59ziwz	t1_d9hfyki	1478036555	I feel the same way here too.  I actually bought a tablet and then realised that a laptop with a touchscreen was so much better.	pieceofrice	t1_d9gjv4a
t3_59ziwz	t1_d9hgwyi	1478037750	It is difficult to hold and type on a tablet as many people have experienced so having something to hold up the touchscreen on a table, sofa or while lying in bed is incredibly useful.  Nothing can ever match the speed, intuition and accuracy of the physical keyboard, and nothing can ever match the screen gesturing (ie. scroll and zoom), intuition and incredibly flexibility of the touchscreen.  Combining the two is the logical and smarter thing to do because you also get better battery life, faster processors and better storage.  I love the fact that I can use my hybrid laptop/tablet in virtually any situation like in bed, on the table and flat down with the screen up.    Nearly every single devices with a screen now uses touchscreen gesturing including watches, phones, tvs, monitors, led/oled readouts on electrical appliances etc etc.  People like /u/slartibartfastr/ don't understand technology at all and can never see past the outdated touchpad lol	sanjugo	t1_d9hfyki
t3_59ziwz	t1_d9hgx8f	1478037760	This is so strange.  I'm seeing a lot more people using laptops with touchscreens than tablets now.

Yah, let's put $6 versions of Minecraft in every school as something "educational"...

t3_59zmg3	t1_d9jxe12	1478180670	I had a first gen Nook.  I did almost no research before buying it and quickly learned (once it was in my hands) that I would only have access to B&amp;N's own little app store.  But I told myself that was ok because B&amp;N was a serious player in this game and they would totally deliver.  It was badass for the first few months and I eagerly checked in a couple times a week to see all the new and exciting apps that were being released for it.  About 8 months in, after I had played Angry Birds to death, I was bored and frustrated with the Nook and barely touched it anymore.  The B&amp;N app store contained very few quality releases and hadn't even released a facebook app by the time I passed my Nook on to goodwill and bought a Nexus 7.  Had the Nook been more expensive it would have been the biggest tech flop I've ever purchased.	nowmakeyourthrowaway	t1_d9d2v7b

t3_5aayfn	t1_d9mjq3g	1478321535	Router and a coaxial-to-ethernet converter thing-a-ma-jig.  Looking to drop my stock Comcast router. Been a subscriber for two years paying their $10/Mo for their router rental fee.   Googling an acceptable router for my needs is easy enough, mostly Hulu and very light gaming are my most bandwidth-demanding tasks. But I do hope to upgrade my setup for more intensive gaming soon.  But what is the converter box thing that converts my Comcast coaxial cable to a usable Ethernet? There seem to be so few consumer options for this piece of hardware and I don't understand what this thing does, how it does it, or how to make an educated purchase. I don't understand the product well enough to know what search terms I want to use to research further.  I always hear how Comcast is one half of the duoplpoy, along with time Warner, when it comes to internet service. And that's certainly the case in my area; Comcast is the only game in town but a few miles out of my city's Verizon FiOS is available but Comcast is not. (Me, personally, I haven't experienced the customer service hell other subscribers have described, but I do live everyday in fear that a data cap will be imposed).  So if Comcast's internet service is so widely used, why don't more companies incorporate the coaxial to Ethernet thingy into the router the way Comcast's hardware does, that I'm currently renting?  I'm a networking newbie. Advice, resources, and info on these topics are appreciated.	0110101001100001	t3_5aayfn

t3_5aayfn	t1_d9oac4x	1478450439	The processor difference is going to be negligible. The S7 processor has marginally better performance, but since it runs more under the hood it'll even out. It's the same reason why the S7 edge has a larger battery than the Pixel XL, but you get more battery life out of the Pixel.   There's give and take on both; you've just got to decide what's important to you. I personally have the edge for a few reasons: I have a lot of music which by nature can't take advantage of the infinite cloud storage, meaning 32 GB unexpandable is out of the question. Likewise I don't have very many photos and don't care about the Pixel's superior camera. I use Nova Launcher so the Pixel launcher and TouchWiz don't appeal to me. What's more, I root my phones so Samsung's excessive bloatware isn't an issue (but unfortunately locks me out of Samsung Pay's MST compatibility).  Again, that's just my reasoning. Everybody is different.	Marcello_Cutty	t1_d9njlc7

t3_5aayfn	t1_d9p1oe9	1478486941	That depends. Do you want a more reliable phone with less bloat,  better speed,  and faster updates? Or,  would you rather the cool gimmicky features? In the US, the pixel phones will easily outperform the s7 edge. Or,  it will out perform them in general because of the lack of bloat. The pixel is more of an iPhone running Android. You get updates directly from the maker when they come out. The pixel uses the snap dragon 821 as the s7 edge uses the 820. The 821 is 10% faster.	hzumbru1	t1_d9njlc7

t3_5byyjp	t1_d9svgvh	1478703472	Shouldn't there still be a difference for your average Joe with an average 1080p screen, like crisper picture and better fps? Genuine question as I'm not fully aware of the Pro's general capabilities.	SupaBloo	t1_d9sso40

t3_5byyjp	t1_d9svls3	1478703666	ELI5: If the developer patches it to utilize the full potential of the Pro, then yes. If they do not patch it, then the game will play exactly the same as it was already programmed to play. Apparently all future PS4 games will support the Pro, with a good amount of the most popular PS4 games already having patches made for them.	SupaBloo	t1_d9su4k5
t3_5byyjp	t1_d9svpho	1478703810	There is, but not with all games. It's up to the developers on how they want to optimize the game as well as allow you options to switch between different settings.	FlashArrow	t1_d9svgvh
t3_5byyjp	t1_d9svs9g	1478703919	Yes.  Eg 60 fps even for video alone is a *huge* difference. You'd have to be blind to not see it. I now record 60fps for all my home videos with my phone, because it's just so much more natural and closer to reality.  Not sure how 4k TVs are. Haven't had the need for that yet because I'm kinda waiting for more content.	PM_YourDildoAndPussy	t1_d9svgvh
t3_5c050q	t1_d9svsr6	1478703938	The price point is pretty similar to the Olympus E-PL line of cameras.	pointy	t3_5c050q
t3_5byyjp	t1_d9svtkb	1478703969	The PS4 Pro is billed as showing high quality improvements when 4k is used in conjunction with HDR. Obviously, testing HDR on a 1080 screen isn't going to showcase the full performance options of the console. As neither would only testing 4k without HDR supported.	FlashArrow	t1_d9svg3e
t3_5byyjp	t1_d9svwct	1478704077	Yeah, I knew developers would have to patch for it, just wasn't sure if it was worth it as a general player with a basic 1080p screen to even consider getting it. If games will run smoother and look sharper on my basic 1080p with the right patches, then I am more likely to consider getting the Pro.  Gamestop will supposedly be doing $200 trade in credit for OG PS4 systems (with all cables and controller) if it's put towards the Pro. With some other games I've been wanting to trade in I could probably get a Pro for under 150-200 which makes it tempting. I don't really *need* the upgrade, but I don't know when a deal like that would be available again.	SupaBloo	t1_d9svpho
t3_5byyjp	t1_d9sw645	1478704450	&gt;Eg 60 fps even for video alone is a huge difference. You'd have to be blind to not see it.  I'm not much of an fps whore (not trying to insult with that term), I just want to have fun. If I can get a nicer picture/fps at a good price then it's worth it, but I don't *need* it.  I play Rocket League on both PS4 and PC, 30-40fps on PS4 and solid 60+ on PC. I can honestly say I've never once made the conscious thought that one looked/felt better than the other, and I've put plenty of time into both systems. That's not to say the difference isn't there, it's just not something that is gamebreaking/making for me. I suppose if I noticed enough of a difference I would think about it more, but I imagine games with more detail in general would show it more.  I've seen some screens of Titanfall 2 on the Pro, and I will say I was impressed, but I can't recall if those were supposed to be HDR/4k images or just your basic 1080p TV screenshot, which I think more people own and would be interested in seeing.

t3_5byyjp	t1_d9t8o4t	1478719762	Sony also heavily backed the blu-ray format with their PS3 at a large upfront cost to them and gamers but ultimately leveraged that to pave the way for the format and their content. To not just step off the gas, but really park the momentum they had built on that format from the PS3 going into this generations console updates is a very poor business decision. Microsoft has managed to leverage the updates in the One S into a path for significant market growth, while Sony's PS4 Pro offers next to nothing special. ~~Since the patch to the original PS4 allows for 4K gaming out of those boxes, the sole incentive left for most consumers is HDR.~~ *(Basically the same but opposite now, just flip 4K and HDR.)* The only thing I can see making a big difference to kick up their growth would be if PSVR becomes an undeniable success.	statenotcity	t1_d9t7h2p
t3_5byyjp	t1_d9t9iy2	1478720784	This is not really at all correct. Theres been a lot of variation in how games implement the extra power, not everyone is including a 1080/60 mode.	turtlespace	t1_d9t4bx9

t3_5byyjp	t1_d9t9x94	1478721252	&gt;It's beyond me why streaming and digital games are becoming so big when home Internet data caps are as well.   Because we don't have a choice.   The Internet providers impose the caps, we have to bend over and take it.  The two main reasons they impose the caps are:   1. It's free money. Data costs cost literally nothing to transmit. Actually and factually nothing. So if you can charge for something that's free, why not? It's pure and complete profit.  2. They have their own services. Who would pay $100 a month for a 4k TV channel when you can pay $15 a month for 4k Netflix? Or from various other streaming sources?	tempest_87	t1_d9sv7qj

t3_5c050q	t1_d9tfh6g	1478727899	Ok, at first I was intrigued but really there is nothing special about this camera. It uses a m3/4 sensor which in the mirrorless market is about as small as it gets (bigger sensors are good mkay).    You could in fact get a much better deal with the FANTASTIC Sony a5000 offering at $380 (B&amp;H photo). The a5000 uses better glass AND comes with an APSC (bigger) sensor. Bonus, you get NFC beaming and smartphone control via a direct wifi (not to be confused with wifi-direct) connection  Source: am m4/3 and NEX APSC shooter.	Codeford	t3_5c050q

t3_5byyjp	t1_d9th8g5	1478730073	Yes, no, not right now...  Right now Sony is jumping up and down about "4k". Can't speak for all devs, but acquaintances on twitter don't really see that as a priority. They'd rather go from 30 to 60 fps, or make the game look a lot prettier. But right now there's a lot of pressure to get "4k" out because a lot of people are buying 4k screens, and like with the One's "resolutiongate" thing, bigger numbers are easier to market.  Come a year or so from now, when there's been more time to work on the thing properly and "Scorpio" gets a name and release, expect to see things other than 4k/HDR being obvious. But not for the initial release.	Tombofsoldier	t1_d9svgvh

t3_5byyjp	t1_d9tmkdg	1478737220	If you have a gigabit internet connection then you're bloody lucky. Most of the world doesn't have a connection this fast, Google Fiber is the only service I've heard of offering it. And this is just the theoretical maximum speed, not what you'll get most of the time. Most people's internet connection wouldn't saturate a quarter gigabit port like the PS3 and xbox 360 had. If your internet doesn't saturate it, you will find zero improvement from switching to a gigabit port on your device.

t3_5c3900	t1_d9tqosj	1478743111	Agreed. The real kicker of course is the battery life, the new MBP will literally last over twice as long on a single charge. You can't even watch 2 movies in a row without running out of juice.  It's easy to push as many features as possible to tick off boxes in a comparison matrix, but you can't lose sight of the end user's experience, and that's unfortunately an area where the vast majority of PC manufacturers are failing at horribly.

t3_5c707b	t1_d9u87tn	1478781011	S7 edge has the same processor and only 4gb of ram compared to on plus 6gb there arguably same speed.  399 for oneplus3 769 for s7 edge   The Google pixel phone has a faster snapdragon 821 which is only a tad faster then the snapdragon 820 in the one plus 3 &amp; s7 edge.   I currently have a s7 edge great phone but does seem a little over priced by like 100-150  I got buy one get one free from tmobile though so I was fine with what I paid overall	gbeezy007	t1_d9u6zaq
t3_5c707b	t1_d9u8inl	1478781741	... is no one checking the benchmarks for these devices? Why am I being downvoted?   Geekbench puts the S7 Edge on top of the Android list, but 200 points behind the iPhone 7.   The Pixel gets 4147. 1000+ points behind the top phones.

I wanted to buy their iPhone case and they couldn't figure out a way to ship it to an address that was different from my paypal billing address. They then told me that it wasn't their problem and it was stupid that I didn't live at my paypal billing address and hung up on me. I liked the idea of them but I have never received worse customer service.	morrispated2	t1_d9u6khx
t3_5c707b	t1_d9ubq41	1478787768	People are complimenting OnePlus on their product quality, but isn't it weird to be releasing a phone just four months after their last flagship?

t3_5c707b	t1_d9ugrtf	1478794499	I want to like oneplus because they do a lot of things right, but some of the stuff they do is just confusing.   Their method of success was top specs for a very affordable price. They have slowly been increasing prices since the op1. They have reduced the battery capacity. They got rid of invites but the op3 is never in stock anyway and now they're releasing a new phone less than 6 months after their last. At a rumored even higher price.  Oneplus, this is what I want. Fill the body out with more battery. Screw dash charge, I want standard quick charging compatibility. 6GB is plenty, 64GB is plenty, 1080p is plenty. Keep the price the same or reduce it and release nougat and keep it to to date. Then release the op4 next year.	cuddlepuncher	t3_5c707b

t3_5c707b	t1_d9ujg19	1478797645	Yeah, dash charge is pretty cool, but i don't think it's worth the incompatibility with all other quick charging and cables. I would rather be able to buy other chargers/cables/battery packs or borrow someone else's and still be able to get quick charging. Oneplus isn't popular enough for anyone else I know to have a dash charger and cable. And having only one manufacturer making the chargers and cables worries me too once the device gets older.	cuddlepuncher	t1_d9uizuw
t3_5c707b	t1_d9ukxjf	1478799341	I've had a very good experience with their customer service. The additional back cover for my OP2 didn't fit properly and I was sent a new one after giving them a link to the imgur album of the fault.	feline_lunacy	t1_d9u6khx
t3_5c707b	t1_d9ukzvx	1478799413	I used to own the s7 and the note7  both are a pc of crop and slow down after you use it for a few weeks.  I now own the OP3 and its way better than any other phone I've ever had.  Don't go off of those numbers	sr_grey	t1_d9u8inl

t3_5c707b	t1_d9um83k	1478800802	Sure this isn't even a considerable problem. What I'm saying is problems with battery or problem with any other part of the phone which can't be fixed like you back cover was.  If that's the case you'll have to ship the phone over a quiet long distance and will need to pay lots of transport costs. I didnt even mention the shipping duration which is hugh mungus.	malcolmX_	t1_d9ukxjf
t3_5c707b	t1_d9umha8	1478801096	Perfect. Myself and my girlfriend are still using our Oneplus Ones. I just changed the USB port on my girlfriends because it was acting up. Hopefully we can score some used Onplus 3's for a decent price in a few months.	pewnflap	t3_5c707b

Went to sleep one night with it working, woke up to it not.  A bit of research on XDA shows that it's a common problem due to a manufacturing defect (the daughterboard the sensor plugs into isn't properly grounded).  Having to use my phone without a home button has soured my opinion of OnePlus a bit.	dion_starfire	t1_d9u9j7z

t3_5c707b	t1_d9vryow	1478869906	Others have said it but Benchmarks dont mean Much as you think there good for Guideline estimates and thats about it. Especially only geekbench that doesnt account for other parts of the phone like if the storage is slow or not which makes a huge difference hence why SSD in computers is big now.  at the END of the Day the Onepuls and s7 have the same exact processor Hardware wise. and you can buy almost 2 for the price of 1 yes the software or themal limits lower the oneplus a little but it does not justify the price	gbeezy007	t1_d9u8inl
t3_5c050q	t1_d9vvztr	1478876849	Yeh, and when I read "rock bottom price" I actually expected a cheaper price. I don't see the point of it, mediocre at every level, sadly. Even if not used, you can probably get a refurbished one that's better. Heck, I even just found a Mint condition NEX F3 with kit lens for $280 that's probably way better.	oMalakai	t1_d9vfp9t

t3_5byyjp	t1_d9wi3b7	1478905965	&gt; Data costs cost literally nothing to transmit. Actually and factually nothing. So if you can charge for something that's free, why not? It's pure and complete profit. &gt;   This is ridiculously untrue. The cost is the upkeep on the lines, paychecks for technicians and support, upkeep on the machines, etc.	snookums	t1_d9t9x94
t3_5byyjp	t1_d9wiba6	1478906296	The lack of UHD cooled any desire I had to buy it honestly.	snookums	t3_5byyjp
t3_5byyjp	t1_d9wr19i	1478919926	Notice how I said "data costs nothing to transmit" and not "networks cost nothing to maintain or create".  There is a ***massive*** difference between the two.   If you build and maintain a network it costs you a certain amount of money. However, whether you transmit one byte of data in a day, or terabytes of data in that day, those costs are *exactly* the same.  I'm not saying that we shouldn't pay for internet, or internet *speed* (I have no issue with people paying more for faster speeds than others). I am however saying that we shouldn't pay for  *data* because as I said, it costs factually nothing when you take out the network building and maintaing costs.	tempest_87	t1_d9wi3b7
t3_5byyjp	t1_d9wtbld	1478923905	But bandwidth isn't an infinite resource. For the company, they could split the same pie among 40 customers or 10.	snookums	t1_d9wr19i
t3_5byyjp	t1_d9wx9xk	1478932311	I'm not arguing about bandwidth (I actually specifically said I support different prices for speeds). I'm arguing against data caps.   Data is the electrons of the signal. The cost an ISP incurs to move one electron (essentially a bit) from a source to a destination is factually, literally, and exactly 0. It does not corrode their lines, it does not fatigue their hardware. It has absolutely zero effect on their system.   Now, how many bits they can move at any given timespan is the bandwidth you were mentioning. And this unit of measurement actually does have limitations and costs associated with increasing the size. Which is why it makes sense to charge people for more or less access to this finite resource.   But *data* itself is not finite, and it costs nothing  to produce or transmit (once the hardware is in place).   Imagine if the current hardware on the Internet suddenly stopped and it was just two computers talking to each other across the country. All the switching hardware and transmission lines are still working at 100%, it's just that every other device has taken a break for some reason.   The cost to maintain the Internet as a whole *doesn't change*.   99.999% of the traffic went away, and nothing would change in regards to ISP costs.   So, now let's have everyone get back online and now we all have data caps. Say I hit my data cap early in the cycle and get throttled in speed. But if I live in an area where the network isn't taxed (read: bandwidth is still largely unused) or at a time of day when few people are using the system (like 3am on Christmas), what is the physical, logical reason that I get throttled? A reason besides "that's what you agreed to".   There isn't one.   Now, throttling me more so than others when the network *is* stressed, fine. But since we established that in all other situations (when the network is not stressed), my data traffic isn't costing anyone any money, time, or effort there is no reason to penalize me for data usage.   At best, data caps are a lazy way to get people to not stress the network infrastructure so that the company doesn't have to upgrade anything. The most likely situation is that data caps are just a cash grab to get free money from customers. The worst case is that it's a way for ISPs to actively hinder competition for services they offer (like Netflix and hulu).   (That last bit is actually what Net Neutrality is all about.)   Does that make sense? I can come up with slightly different explanations and analogies to help round out the argument if you want, because sadly this is a complex enough topic that a single analogy can sometimes fall short or be confusing (like the traditional "pipes and tubes" analogy).   Edit: minor formatting changes.	tempest_87	t1_d9wtbld
t3_5c707b	t1_d9x7n73	1478963665	The point of Dash is that it charges your phone super quickly without heating the phone, which does wonders to prevent battery degradation. Other fast charging standards can't do that.	dmnw0w	t1_d9ujg19

t3_5coil0	t1_d9y7nsv	1479021353	I'm gonna be "that guy" for a minute here.  Are the shoes fresh to death?  Absolutely.  Fucking fly as fuck.  But... the negative impact of this trend could be enormous on both a human and environmental scale from rare earth elements mined to manufacture flexible lcd.  That mining fuels shitty situations like low-intensity civil war in places like Congo and DRC, and has significant negative environmental consequences.  And that is happening already from current market demands on rare earth extraction.  Do we really need to expand into shoes and other wearables?  I think the problem is that most people have at least some level of a disconnect between a finished product and the long, meandering road involving huge multinational corps who deal with the materiel that ultimately produces things in the marketplace.  And people rarely remember to ask not just the "can we" but also the "should we" be doing this.  One can feel bad enough knowing their fly Nikes were stitched up by exploited workers, but do we really need to bring fucking mining companies into this?  Just for a more fly pair of shoes?  It seems dumb to me, considering that rare earth elements are rarely recycled, and in a product like a shoe or some other wearable, the likelihood of it being recycled is probably even less.  I think the shoes are definitely cool as fuck, but c'mon.  I dunno, maybe it is too much to ask to expect your average sneakerhead (or average person) to consider where shit comes from, to really think it through.  And I am not saying this without acknowledging that to some degree it is hypocritical to say shit like this comment and even exist for one day in the modern world.  I'm guilty of bad behavior due to this disconnect just as much as anyone can be on a random day, but I really do try not to be.  I'm certainly not out in the market making and trying to sell products like this.  I dunno, yeah, it is a bit of a rant, but I see shit like this and think "whoa, cool" and then my mind takes a step back and I think, "fuck man, do we really need to add mining companies to the list of entities benefitting from a significant share of material cost for making a pair of sneakers?"   To me, the answer is no.  And before anybody comments to take a shit on my rant saying "why are you taking a pair of shoes so seriously bro?", consider that products like this could be the avant garde of a trend toward more and more wearable, tech-infused products, and then think about the increased load of strain on the earth such a market force would inevitably produce.  I could go on and on, but if anyone has hung in there this far down into the comment, they probably already agree with me to some extent.	ricard_anise	t3_5coil0

t3_5coil0	t1_d9y9b9f	1479026105	My mate Petersen once bought a pair of shoes with artificial intelligence. 'Smart Shoes' they were called. It was a neat idea: no matter how blind drunk you were, they could always get you home. But he got pissed one night in Oslo and woke up the next morning in Burma. You see, the shoes got bored just going from his local pub to the flat. They wanted to see the world. He had a hell of a job getting rid of them. No matter who he sold them to, they'd show up again the next day. He tried to shut them out, but they just kicked the door down.  Last thing he heard, they'd sort of robbed a car and drove it into a canal. They couldn't steer, you see. He was really, really blown away about it. He went to see a priest. The priest told him it was alright and all that the shoes were happy and that they'd gone to heaven. You see, it turns out shoes have soles.	Fnhatic	t3_5coil0

t3_5coil0	t1_d9ya09g	1479028501	I live near Portland, Oregon. We have a lot of homeless, and I have insomnia so I walk around a lot at night when the streets are mostly empty. I've been stopped quite a few times when wearing my normal shoes and such. But when I wear the boots, I can almost always walk without being bothered.  I think the first thought of any mugger is "does he look easy to mug?", so I try to look as intimidating as possible.  The boots belonged to my uncle. He toured 3 times in Iraq.  Chinatown is literally riddled with homeless drug abusers and I've been followed and screamed at for 20 minutes until I called police.  I guess the boots are more or less me *thinking* I'm safer. I just have a lot of confidence in my ability to protect myself when I wear them, so I walk with a longer stride and look straight ahead instead of looking down and listening to Spotify or something.

t3_5coil0	t1_d9yshdn	1479066563	Is there anything you would accept as evidence to the contrary to that, or would I be wasting my time?  &gt;Several investigations have found, however, that no action by Clinton -- or anybody in the administration -- could have moved additional forces to Benghazi before the last American deaths...  &gt;There have been eight congressional investigations of Benghazi so far, most of which were run by Republicans. Several of their reports criticized Clinton and her State Department for the security setup in Benghazi, for their part in the administration messaging after the attack, and for not holding themselves accountable afterward.  &gt;But **they [the Republican-led investigations] generally criticized the Defense Department or other parts of the administration, not Clinton or the State Department, for delays in deploying military assets the night of the attack**. When Congressman Mike Pompeo asked Clinton, "Why was heaven and earth not moved at the initial sound of guns," in terms of sending help, Clinton told him to ask the Defense Department.  &gt;...In fact, **it wasn’t Clinton’s responsibility to send troops to the scene — the military chain of command took that responsibility**. The Defense Department attempted to send help to the scene, but was unable to reach Benghazi before the deaths occurred.  Criticizing her for the initial security issues would be fair. Criticizing her for things that were not her responsibility or within her control just shows you are not informed about the issue and are serving as a parrot. It's important to not just accept things at face value regardless of who is saying them.	movzx	t1_d9ys2hd
t3_5coil0	t1_d9ysmbd	1479066745	Wow Clinton needed a lot more investigations than I originally thought. Isn't this man acting like a parrot up here? Saying the same shit about trump over and over again. Are you a Clinton supporter?	i_bhoptoschool	t1_d9yshdn
t3_5coil0	t1_d9z1smu	1479078614	I would not say he's being a parrot because his statement is fairly generic. If you had said "Dumb Clinton" or whatever we wouldn't be having this conversation. You can't really cite anything to prove or disprove that claim. If he would have said "Rapist Trump" I might be having this conversation with him instead because that is about a specific, falsifiable claim.  I'm not a Clinton supporter nor am I a Trump supporter, but I benefit strongly from either side being in office. Clinton's social plans align more with my interests, but as an upper class white male with real estate and other investments Trump will undoubtedly benefit me financially.   I am, however, a huge fan of both sides doing their own research into topics instead of just parroting talking points.  If you feel that she deserves more investigations because of what I quoted above then the more power to you. I just want your disdain for her (or any candidate) to be based in reality and not lies put forth by the media. I defend Trump the same way when people make outlandish claims that are provably false. For example, being against welfare programs doesn't immediately mean someone is racist just because a higher population of black people might be on welfare.	movzx	t1_d9ysmbd

The other reason it's a good solution for you, is that I assume those movie files are already on your PC.  You can install Plex on your PC and download Plex app on Roku, and stream movies on your PC through your Roku connecting to your TV via wifi.

However the newer Roku 3 and 4 does have a USB port.  There's also the Intel compute stick which has a full Windows installation on it. And the Chrome bit which is Chrome OS on a stick.

The iPhone connects to the Bluetooth in my car and then the watch so responding to texts is out since it makes it wonky there too with the mic pickup being the car's instead of the watch's (I think) and basically not responding after I speak intooooo the microphone.  Declining phone calls is the best part for sure --  reading texts after that...  emails not so much, and the occasional 007-Esque phone conversation..  it's a kinda fun toy, not a particularly useful tool.

Yes cuts, etc all can lead to ulcers which can lead to amputations, but if we can prevent the pressure ulcers, then we prevent the amputations.   And I completely disagree with the notion  that the disease process and therefore amputations are an inevitable party of having DM. Intervention can have positive effects in many aspects of the disease. This sock  is only one part of prevention, but it seems like a very simple way to help someone with diabetes have a bit of control over it.	notthefakehigh5r	t1_dagfa2k
t3_5ez4c6	t1_dagiw6c	1480184238	How would you wash them? I feel like that's a super important factor to a pair of socks.   Edit: It's says you can machine wash them in the article. I should've read it first.	DoubleCrescent	t3_5ez4c6
t3_5ez4c6	t1_dagj18c	1480184430	Sorry, I thought I was on /r/medicine and not on a general public one that focuses on the promising device of the future, not the practicality of them. I deleted the comment so I could further explain what I was saying with a basic explanation. Diabetes leads to microvascular damage meaning it destroys the blood vessels. That's what causes kidney failure, blindness, neuropathy, etc. We check these things for yearly but it's more to get a sense of how the disease is progressing. By the time you are getting ulcers, the damage is pretty far along and isn't reversible. The ulcers don't get infect because of neuropathy they get infected because the person doesn't have a good blood supply anymore to bring in white blood cells to fight. High blood sugars have also been shown to impair the function of white blood cells.   What I was also saying in the original post is that the type of patient that needs amputations is pretty far along in the disease process and already isn't taking care of their disease. An expensive pair of socks which detects for heat changes isn't going to replace basic foot care. Especially when inflammation is a sign of a functioning immune system, which isn't true in someone nearing amputation stage of diabetes. These socks help catch ulcers early, but so do a cheap pair of brand new white socks.   Edit: I'll also add that I treat all new devices with pessimism until they have data to back them up. I'll gladly eat my words and recommend these socks if they are shown to change outcomes. But current wearable devices haven't been shown to change the underlying pathology, just give a false sense of security.	DrBabs	t1_dagh7fg
t3_5ez4c6	t1_dagj63z	1480184607	Doctor here. Certainly the problem of diabetic foot damage is a huge one. However I have some concerns that this sock isn't the best way to address the problem.  The special socks here sense changes in heat. However that is a crude measure. Diabetic feet have poor microcirculation. The blood flow is too low to mount a good healing or immune response. Therefore an infection would likely have to be raging before part of the foot got measurably warm.  Second, foot temp varies wildly depending on activity, type of shoe, weather, if the foot is near an air vent or many other factors. Detecting a true signal from noise will be very difficult.  In short, even if it could be done, detecting an infection based on heat would only alert you far too late in the process. Pressure sensing may do better.	IdRatherBeTweeting	t3_5ez4c6
t3_5ez4c6	t1_dagji33	1480185057	Yup, MS4 here.  Your comment implied someone who gets foot ulcers will inevitably get an amp. It's more likely, but to say early recognition and treatment of ulcers wouldn't lead to decreased amps is just wrong.  Completely agree on the practicality/cost argument. However, while new white socks could work, you're assuming your patient is going to look as you recommend which you and I both know just isn't true in many cases.	TheBlackAthlete	t1_dagj18c

Kind of cool... pricier than your socks but if they work, $20/month is probably cheaper than potential wound care and definitely cheaper than an amputation.	tavery2	t1_dagfqp8
t3_5ez4c6	t1_dagmhla	1480189176	I was thinking much along the same lines. I'm sure the product works wonderfully *as a temperature sensor*, but a temperature sensor is a crude and poor measure of foot health in anyone, diabetic or otherwise.    Along those same lines, sensing pressure would require a pretty controlled environment.  I mean, wouldn't pressure sort of go off the charts if I started running?  How's that going to mesh with my daily treadmill time?  I don't know _much_ about pressure sensors, but I'd expect the sock itself would have to be tight enough to maintain a constant pressure on the foot to be able to sense changes in the foot, which seems like it could be fairly uncomfortable.  Compression pants are fun when it's your pants, but not so much your feet, I think.	ew73	t1_dagj63z

t3_5ez4c6	t1_dahgogk	1480244143	Happy to help. The answer is very simple. In type one diabetes, the patient doesn't make insulin but responds to insulin just like a normal person. Therefore the most insulin they would ever need is the amount of insulin a normal person would make throughout the day.    A type two diabetic is different.  They not only stop producing insulin,  their tissues also become less sensitive to insulin. Therefore it is common for a type two diabetic to require much more insulin and the total amount of insulin a normal person would produce in a day.     In short,  The difference isn't in insulin production because you can have very low or no insulin production and type two diabetes and you have no insulin production and type one diabetes.  The difference is how the body responds to the insulin. Type two diabetic's do not respond correctly to insulin. They are insulin resistant.	IdRatherBeTweeting	t1_dah5it9
t3_5ez4c6	t1_dahgvky	1480244860	Once the fracture has already occurred, there isn't a ton to do about it. The focus of the sock is on prevention and frankly there is in a good way to prevent the fractures that cause Charcot foot.	IdRatherBeTweeting	t1_dah6az1
t3_5ez4c6	t1_dahh15b	1480245442	What is interesting about your comment is that it proves my point perfectly. You seem to think that a type two diabetic cannot get diabetic ketoacidosis, only hyperglycemiac hyperosmolar syndrome.  The fact is that some type two diabetic's produce so with a little insulin that they too can get diabetic ketoacidosis. Distinguishing between the two diseases by which one causes DKA is incorrect.   Using vague terms like "insulin-dependent" and "insulin resistant" and "insulin requiring"  contributes to this common misunderstanding..   You should use the terms type one diabetic and type two diabetic like the rest of the medical community to avoid confusion.  Put simply, it is just a much more accurate way of describing the differences between the two diseases.	IdRatherBeTweeting	t1_dahcla6

t3_5ez4c6	t1_dahk218	1480254982	Any cuts or red spots, discolouration, especially on the soles of the feet. Anything that is an open wound, or blister appearance.   (TL:DR at end)  Long story: the disease process can slowly cut off blood supply to your extremities through a couple of different mechanisms. Once this happens the nerves die, so you loose sensation. This happens in a "sock and glove" pattern.   So without nerves you can't feel your feet/hands. And you don't have blood supply, so any simple cuts or a stubbed toe, and your body can't heal it.   The loss of nerve supply also changes the structure of the foot, because the passive tension of the muscles is lost. So now the foot has a different shape, so instead of just the heel and toes taking the pressure, other structures are. But you can't feel this!   All of this leads to pressure sores. So something like a pebble in your shoe, or even just wearing shoes that don't fit result in a wound that is very hard to heal. If it gets infected, it will often lead to amputation.   It's  very important for diabetic patients with neuropathy to check their feet. We tell them to use a selfie stick  to take pics of the bottom of their feet to look for red spots or cuts. For those that don't have access to a selfie stick, we have them attach a mirror on the end of something like a broom or yard stick, or whatever they have so they check feet daily.   TL:DR Diabetes restricts blood supply, which will damage nerves. Some people loose all sensation in their hands and feet. When they get a minor cut, they can't feel it and their body can't heal it. This leads to infection and eventually amputation.   Fun fact: diabetes is the leading cause of amputation in the US and it's believed that about 90% are preventable.

My budget is around 800-1300 dollars and I want to play games like tf2, CS:GO, and newer games with a relatively good performance.	Hail_Cheesus	t3_5facip
t3_5facip	t1_daj8dkz	1480354671	Would anyone knowledgeable able to talk with me via PM. I am buying a new phone, tablet, e-cig, and tablet today while everything is on sale. Right now I am thinking of getting the Pixel, the Boogie Board with bluetooth and internal memory for note-taking, and either a Thinkpad, Latitude, or XPS, or maybe the Thinkpad Carbon X1. I don't know which e-cig to get yet. I am also thinking of either the Boogie Board or an Android Tablet, but it must be able to take notes. Being able to watch media would be nice, but I always carry a phone with me. I was going to get the Note 7, went from Note 3 to Oneplus One skipping the Note 5; but now, I can't wait for the Note 8, so I have decided on the Pixel.  Suggestions for a tablet, laptop, and e-cig would be nice.  I am a computer engineer and electrical engineer student, and I am learning to program and hopefully the tools necessary for server administration. I need a laptop that would be able to use any programs I would need in the two fields I am studying, and I am hoping the laptop will last me the next 2 years to use for my masters in EE and finishing a process engineering degree simultaneously.   I'd like to game on it as well. I used to be a big gamer but lost interest. So I am also looking at the XPS, but I could also build a mini/micro tower computer for that. I need to look at the weight of the XPS to see if I want to be carrying it around in a backpack all day. I'll have my tablet for notes and possibly media and the phone for media.  It is Cyber Monday. I'll wait to get a mini/micro PC if I don't get the XPS because I can only spend so much in one day. Any recommendations would be very appreciated.  My uni also has 2 3d printers and scanners. I know there are Android apps to take multiple pictures that will estimate the measurements, but I am hoping a Thinkpad/Latitude would also be powerful enough to allow me to edit a 3d model for use in a 3d printer.  Thanks.	techmonday	t3_5facip
t3_5facip	t1_dajb3oj	1480357912	Hi folks,  I'm on the hunt for a budget-friendly security camera for my mother. Her husband recently passed away, and she's a little nervous about living alone. Blink ticks off most of my requirements, but I figured I'd see if anyone had a better suggestion:  * Battery powered/wire-free ('cause I'm not confident in my ability to figure out wiring for the locations I'd like to install these cameras in, plus I'm certain my mother won't let me drill holes in her exterior walls) * Wi-Fi capable * No monthly fee * IOS or Window10 compatible * Low light * Weather-proof a bonus, but not required - the locations are fairly sheltered from rain  Ideally I'd like to snag two cameras for around or under $150. Blink is on Amazon for $169, which is stretching my budget a bit. If there's a coupon code, that'd be fantastic.	SandD0llar	t3_5facip
t3_5facip	t1_dajh2v9	1480365025	Hi guys,  I built a PC about 2 years ago and there are some great deals going on today on parts so I was wondering if someone could take a look over my current build and suggest anything if there's any real great deals going on today.  I haven't used this computer in about a year since I've been traveling but I'll have it in my hands again soon and looking to upgrade if possible  Few things I DEFINITELY need:  1.

Harddrive: Samsung 850 EVO 500GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E500B/AM)   I don't remember what graphics card or RAM I have but I think they are both pretty decent, however I think the graphics card was my weakest part.

t3_5facip	t1_dak9zfs	1480407183	Hello! I'm looking for a mobile device as a gift for a sweet but... *silly* womanchild who casually games.   (Please forgive my own tech-illiteracy, I have no idea what I'm looking for, only the functions I'd like to see.)  I would like it to have the following features: access to the Google Play Store, camera, email/Gmail, *Pokémon GO!*, phone calls, Spotify, texting capabilities, *Zombies, Run!*, and perhaps a few other apps of her choosing.  Something basic that can handle all that. Her last phone could barely access the Google Play Store, much less download a single mobile game. I don't know that she'll need too much space, as I don't expect her to try downloading large videos on to it and she has her music on a separate device. The idea is that she'll pay for the phone plan herself and use the existing Internet utilities where she lives.  EDIT: Oh, and not an Apple product, please. We'll be taking a look on Craigslist.  Much thanks for any advice!	al_bert-o	t3_5facip
t3_5facip	t1_dako47j	1480437145	So, I can't point you to an exact phone, but most phones released then the past few years should be able to do what you're looking for. I just wanted to make a note here as far as space goes, videos/images/music are typically not what take up the larger share of space on a phone, normally it's the apps themselves that take up large amounts of space.

t3_5facip	t1_dalgtdy	1480472561	Ok looks like your best used options are HTC one m8, galaxy s5, lg g3, or iPhone 5s. I would say your best new option would be the Moto g4 play prime edition which is $99 or the Blu advanced 5.0 starting at $59.99 (I do not recommend the advanced 5.0 but it is an option). If possible I would highly recommend getting the lg g3 out of all these options because it has 1 gig more of ram and a quad HD display.	AllGoodMenDie	t1_dalbp2j

Once you go down the fitbit path though and have to deal with warranty and replacements, and have that cut off even though their products suck and they continue to sell products they know will fail, and then offer you a new, more expensive product without the same features for a 'deal' you begin to realize that you're not buying a product, but rather paying a monthly fee to be a fitbit member.

t3_5facip	t1_damdjt2	1480531032	Not sure where you live, so I'm assuming the US. See if there happens to be some sort of local headphone store near you. I've never seen Grado's in store more than once, and never somewhere where I can try on enthusiast headphones. I haven't spent that much time looking either though, so you may have better luck. Real expensive novelty stores could have it, when I was in London I went into Harrods and tried on a pair of HD800's. Something like that near you could have what you want.	fuckflyingpigs	t1_dalg9t1

t3_5facip	t1_damdttd	1480531356	[This article](http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/question110.htm) explains the prongs pretty well. Essentially, the third prong that isn't always there, is for grounding. The idea behind grounding is to protect the people who use metal-encased appliances from electric shock. Because you're moving power and not just plugging something in, I would look for something that includes the third prong.   Not sure what you mean by the amount of prongs on the back, but I hope I answered your question. By two prongs do you mean it plugs into two outlets at once? If so it probably won't make a difference, I've been running at least 700w of power through one outlet for a full year thanks to a power strip, you should be fine and not lack power.	fuckflyingpigs	t1_dakt3eo

We were able to connect to it via our phones in less than five minutes from making an account, and it's easy to control.   End choice is up to you.

t3_5fpvek	t1_damjhqj	1480537666	I think it depends on whether you're evaluating the watch primarily based on the elegance of its internal mechanism vs its aesthetic appeal. The $50 watch and the $200 watch may have comparable inner workings, but often the more expensive option will have more aesthetic appeal and have better quality materials incorporated on the outside (gold, silver, gemstones).   I don't think it would be off-base for me to say that for the vast majority of users, the tiny improvements in the quality of the *timekeeping* between low end and high end watches is virtually unnoticeable - the main motivation for spending extra money is aesthetic. This is why I think the better analogy is to clothing, not something like headphones.   In the case of headphones, the difference in *sound* quality between low end and high end is very noticeable, and for most people the improvement in sound quality is the main motivator for spending extra money on headphones, not that the expensive ones *look* better. That is, they're less a fashion statement then they are practical tools, and most users evaluate them as such.	olivish	t1_damivg7

t3_5fpvek	t1_damkxp3	1480539227	I think if I sent this comment to my friends they would think it was me. How can they not replace a product that has a clear manufacturer's defect because it is "out of warranty", even though the warranty they're using is on the original device. That's like buying a new car and having the warranty be based on your trade-in. Sorry, but why would I buy their new product when they won't even honor the quality of their old ones?

Long gone are the days of a loud offending noise waking me up. My wrist just vibrates slightly (enough to wake most).  I am always skeptical of first iterations of new tech. I laughed at the Fitbit originally and the entire 'smart watch' market.	IrishNinjah	t1_dambrpm

t3_5facip	t1_dammqj7	1480541160	I hope this is a right place to ask for an advice:  I've been recently gotten interested in Smart LED systems and home automation aspects of the technology.  I see that there are LIFX and Philips Hue for the starters but would anyone have an open suggestion or recommendation?  What I would like to achieve below at a minimum:  - Be able to manage lighting in home wirelessly via smart phones and if possible with voice commands. (And by the way, are most Light units controlled On-The-Product or from the power outlet with the help of special parts between the power source and the light unit? It looked like most of them have their own chips et that manages brigtness, color, etc.)  - Motion sensor activated (Looked like separate units are required for motion sensing capability)  - Be able to tie the light control system to a hub/system that will help me use in junction with  What other things can I look out for when it comes to quality of LED units than the brand names? Some brand names I can think of include Philips, CREE, GE..  Thanks in advance! :)	kconfire	t3_5facip

t3_5facip	t1_damoqgo	1480543368	Hi all!  I've been looking for a replacement gadget for the Zeno.   It's essentially a handheld battery operated zit zapper.   AFAIK, it has a small metal plate/dot on the end that, when the zeno turns on, heats up to a warm temp, which is then placed on a pimple (maybe shoots oxygen into the pore?) which helps to reduce bacteria and swelling.   A gadget I've been pointed to is the "Tanda Zap Acne Treatment" but this hardly seems to work at all (doesn't heat up as much, just seems like a bunch of LEDs)   Any hints?	eysemple	t3_5facip
t3_5fpvek	t1_damoytb	1480543635	You're not getting anykind of gold, silver, or gemstones for $200. Just higher quality mechanisms and construction. To put it simply, the watch will just feel a bit more solid.	Sirsteezly	t1_damjhqj
t3_5fpvek	t1_dampkge	1480544329	I have a Garmin HR. Tracks my sleep, my workout sessions, steps and movement during the day.  I can control my music (previous, play, next) and see the temperature.  At first, I didn't see the need but it has I noticed my fitness for the last 3 months (Made it easier as a physical reminder and tool)	funinsyd	t1_damnx58
t3_5fpvek	t1_dampz40	1480544802	Compared to watches, they are cheap. Got mine on sale for $50 and just got my wife a new one for $59. We are by no means "financially endowed"...nowhere close.   Surprisingly they actually do get you to walk more. My wife runs around the house late at night to "get her steps in". I walk my dogs more, will park further away from a store and walk to the mailbox instead of getting mail on the way in. So I say they are worth it.	ryancunderwood	t1_dambrpm
t3_5fpvek	t1_dampzbf	1480544808	I use my FitBit Charge (I think)  to track my exercise and my sleep.  It helps me notice when I slip into my old habit of getting far too little sleep for several nights a week.	AtmaJnana	t1_damnx58
t3_5fpvek	t1_damq1nh	1480544883	I have had two Fitbit flex's and now a blaze. My gf has had the same. She's about to upgrade to a garmin vivoactive HR. I can tell you for people who actively exercise like we do (I would suspect not your average redditor) they're very useful. The HR monitor is accurate enough to know which zone you're in. It's good at counting calories throughout the day to know how much you've burned compared to how much you eat. I regularly use mine to watch for notifications without pulling my phone out, set random alarms without having to use the phone (food time in the oven works really well) and a countdown timer to have an exact time between sets at the gym. Also being able to set my phone down across the room and change music while working out is helpful. They're not necessary but once you find the use of them it's hard to not have it. Before I got a smart fitness watch I was in the market for luxury watches (2000 dollars and higher) and now I can't justify that kind of cost, even if they're gorgeous.	amgine	t3_5fpvek

t3_5fpvek	t1_damszyx	1480548524	I have a flex 2 because I received one from work for free. The value you get from them is that you can compare you activity level, and compete with other people. I would also say that if you work a desk job like me, it can be a good motivator to get those 10,000 steps a day. The steps might not be accurate, but it gives you something to shoot for at the gym after work. It will even vibrate to let you know you have met your goal (you can also change the goal to whatever you want).   By all means, these things are not accurate if you simply wish to track data points, but they are an excellent way to motivate and have some more fun being active. I wouldn't spend $99 on one, but since I have one I definitely am using it.	MatttDamon	t1_damnx58

t3_5fpvek	t1_damtiru	1480549199	I still think fitbit zips are way better than any other fitbit just for the fact that you don't have to wear it on your wrist.

Also I've dropped mine in water a few times and it hasn't been damaged which obviously it's not intended for use in water but at least it doesn't immediately break when water touches it like most things.	vulpes_carnivora	t3_5fpvek

t3_5fpvek	t1_damu4bh	1480549988	Hard for me to justify an activity tracker like this since my phone can already serve as a step counter (however accurate or inaccurate it may be in comparison), and if I wanted to know more details about my running I can just use Runkeeper or something like that.

t3_5facip	t1_dan7lk0	1480568543	[This 2015 Cnet Guide](https://www.cnet.com/news/smart-home-buying-guide-home-automation/) might be a good place to start. Both PCMag and ThisOldHouse have had more recent lists of products that are now on the market.  [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-smart-led-light-bulbs/) recently looked at smart led lights in this guide.   You probably should consider whether particular systems are compatible with other systems and how expandable they are. Compatibility with other systems gives you flexibility to add other categories of smart products but probably introduces some security issues. A product line with diversity allows you to expand more easily.  Two issues to think about that probably aren't in most guides are the issues of internet security and whether using particular smart devices will adversely affect you if your internet provider has a low data cap. Many recent news stories have focused on malware that uses "the internet of things" such as smart home devices for various internet attacks. Before investing in smart home devices and smart lighting, consider whether your modem, router, and security measures need updating or replacement. Look for devices from companies with a good record of pushing out quick updates. Look at where the devices are made as well.  As for data caps, you will need to determine if your provider has a cap and if so, what traffic is actually counting toward that cap. Some smart devices may need more data than you think.

t3_5fpvek	t1_dan8l1h	1480570227	I've had a Flex 1 for one or two years now and I've never had a problem with it (and neither have the other people I know with a Flex). Usually I leave it charging overnight. A friend had issues with her Charge, but according to the company it was a firmware issue and not battery related. They replaced it and the new one has been working fine. Other than that I've never actually known anyone to have a mechanical issue with their devices, though the casing/straps can be an issue. I'm upgrading to an Alta soon, so we'll see how that goes.	KnotARealGreenDress	t1_damr8fn
t3_5facip	t1_dan8m0e	1480570273	Wow, thank you so very much for your input WarpSeven.  I will make sure to go through all the list and see what will fit my ideal smart home system setup.  In fact, I, too, questioned security behind all Smart systems and started to look for efforts these "smart" companies are making to protect and secure the information flowing through their services.  I think I am not ready for a full-blown automated smart appliances and system, but will start with a small, and a simple setup that minimizes a potential security compromises.

t3_5facip	t1_dan8yce	1480570889	You are most welcome! I should add that the data usage issue came up several times in /r/cordcutters last year and several folks posted info about their troubles with this. Theoretically, much of the data should remain within your own home network but in some cases that wasn't what people were reporting, especially if using a cable rental modem. I have no way to verify that unfortunately as in my case my internet is fairly slow so I have not attempted this.   I think you are wise to proceed carefully. Best wishes with your project!

I received one as a gift and, after the novelty wore off, it felt like a dorky distraction that provided features and information I didn't want or could get on my phone.  If you do want to check your heart rate occasionally (while not moving) try the Cardiio phone app.  Sleep tracking phone apps are also a cheaper option than a wrist band.   I think fitness trackers will, one day, be a vital tool for anyone looking to improve their health and athleticism but, right now, they don't offer enough.	thor_barley	t1_damnx58

t3_5gk3zy	t1_daszwtr	1480921547	I have a MacBook and I'd like to think I know a little bit. Built my own PC (admittedly not very hard to do). But I've made my own headphone amps and did some really really base level robotics camps going into college. I learned the basics of Blender 3D modeling and AutoCAD in 11th grade. I even made a really horrible clunky little game which I was pretty happy about at the time.   I got a MacBook because honestly I don't need or want to be tinkering with a laptop. I want it to be portable and just powerful enough to run some design software. And sue me but I really think it looks nice, which when I stare at it and use it for hours every day is kind of a good thing. It feels thought out and it makes me happy when I use it. Rest assured If I wanna do serious rendering or gaming I'll go to my desktop though.   but I really think most Mac users are really nowhere near as pretentious as they get made out to be. A lot of em are tech fans and a lot aren't but they just got a Mac because they wanted it. Simple as that there's no weird desire to seem like a professional, and they aren't deluded sheep.   There seems to be a good balance of technologically illiterate people in both camps. Which is fine computers and tech isn't everyone's thing, but if someone wants to spend $3000 on an upper mid spec machine, that's their deal I don't really care.  Sorry for the spiel. Don't take this as me picking at your comment for no reason but that's my take on it, and labeling Mac users as people who only buy their machines for the image of techyness or whatever seems like quite the generalization.	jrodan94	t1_daswuy5

t3_5gk3zy	t1_datdqq2	1480953743	The primary thing that makes the mac better than the xps is the display. Windows still doesn't have proper gui scaling and reading text on high resolution windows laptops can be painful.   The second thing that makes it better is the software ecosystem. Because apple has been used for so long by software developers there is a good amount of software that is really useful that works perfectly on mac but is really hard to get running on windows.  The last things are all minor qol differences like better trackpads, battery life (not so true anymore), and light weight.	friedman24	t1_datdark

t3_5gmycw	t1_dats7wc	1480970575	Can confirm. This device runs a bitcoin miner as well as acting as a backdoor for malicious exe's, which get run without the user's permission.  It's a complete nightmare.  Did I mention the miner runs on a local cpu? Not on the Plume itself. It just ferries the miner over, then your actual computer will devote cycles to mining that won't show up in your task manager.	akjoltoy	t1_datl7uo
t3_5gk3zy	t1_datswv5	1480971356	I think you might be behind a little bit. The Rift's been a consumer product for a little over a year. The hand controllers start shipping this month.

I'd have to ask: if these really have so many issues, wouldn't even one of the outlets that got a review package notice it during their tests, and mention it in the article?   And if they are doing this, then they're definitely not forthcoming in their ToS. They're very explicitly against data mining and collection in the privacy policy.	JaredWsSb	t1_datl7uo

t3_5gmycw	t1_datwazg	1480975224	It doesn't seem like trolling. It seems bizarrely targeted, like the kind of thing meant to attract journalists like myself, to get republished without any sort of fact-checking.   The larger outlets are becoming notorious for that sort of crap, entire stories have been written around Tweets and Facebook posts filled with bad information. I try to avoid it in my own work, so I check the facts pretty rigorously.  I can't say for sure that those comments were written with that in mind, but... it certainly seems like it, doesn't it?

t3_5gmycw	t1_dauiua3	1481007331	I doubt it'd be very easy to notice given that the hardware is a blackbox, but the burden of the proof lays on the accuser.  /u/clarret is just slandering a well-meaning startup if he doesn't provide proof the back up his claims.

t3_5gmycw	t1_dav8hv4	1481053246	So... without a web interface, how would a home based sysadmin manage network problems for his parents? More importantly, how would one be able to port forward? Assign static IPs? Or use an existing router with the Flume Pods acting as WiFi access points only?  For the same price as 6, one could buy 2 Ubiquiti Unify AP Lite units (or a single Pro) and an Edge Router for a 1600-2000 sqft home and have more control and reliability over their network. Sure it might need a wee bit more work setting up, but once online, I can almost guarantee you'll never need to configure it again until something wears out...	kirashi3	t3_5gmycw

The surface book is actually quite nice too but is hilariously expensive even compared to the MacBook Pro so it wasn't really an option.

t3_5gk3zy	t1_davht6k	1481064076	Yeah the XPS is a solid machine and if you need the ports that the 2016 MacBook doesn't have it's obviously superior in that respect. Not everyone cares about such things but the mac is better in a lot of ways (a lot of which ironically aren't "pro" such as no fucking sd card slot) the touchpad in particular which if you truly use it as a laptop is crucially important still hasn't been matched by any competitor. Funnily enough in the 13 inch variant the mac actually has vastly better graphics performance as well (iris vs hd 620).	PanicAtTheCSGO	t1_datdqq2
t3_5gk3zy	t1_davla6i	1481068650	No not really, only the MacBook/Pro really fit with this kind of ideology. At what point are you connecting your desktop to a monitor via USB-C, and why would you need 3 additional USB-C ports... unless you had already bought accessories and dongles for USB-C, say, because you bought one of Apple's new laptops.

t3_5gz8dt	t1_dax52ct	1481155893	I have multiple routers at home connected together, some of the common problems I run into including random disconnect between different stations and mobile devices don't always automatically switch to the closest station with the best signal as you move around. You also have to pick a channel when you set up connection between stations and that's fixed.  These mesh network devices are suppose to solve all those problems. In Google's case they monitor your network every 5 minutes and switch to the least congested channel and ensures your devices are always connected to the station with the best signal.	metabug	t1_dawj40g

t3_5gz8dt	t1_daya5tc	1481224600	It's different because it's accessible to average people who don't know the first thing about setting up a network. They can just take them out of the box, open the app on their phone or tablet, and set them up with no hassle. They're designed to form a mesh (there are various ways this might happen, because there are various ways to set up a mesh while working in 802.11ac/n/g), rather than just acting as a dumb repeater or even an extender, and they're designed to provide solid speeds, which is something that reviews have backed up. [There is also some nice stuff going on behind the scenes.](https://madeby.google.com/wifi/how-it-works/)  I was considering getting a single one for my parents for Christmas. I have them currently set up with a DD-WRT Buffallo router (my old one), and I have to make an SSH tunnel every time I need to troubleshoot for them or change a setting. The Google WiFi would be more reliable, and they could change basic settings from the app when they needed to.  There are also [important little bells and whistles](https://madeby.google.com/wifi/app/), like the ability to easily do QoS, where you could have the router give priority to a streaming device, for example, over other things in the house. Usually this involves all kinds of jiggery pokery and fussing about, but Google's made the interface something that an average user should be comfortable with.  You also have the option to boot devices off of the network temporarily (for example a kid's tablet when they're supposed to be asleep in bed). They've also made this something that's more user-accessible than other routers tend to be.  The app also makes it easy to set up a temporary guest network if you're going to have a bunch of people over who you might not want to have your actual WiFi password. Though that's one that less savvy average users might not take advantage of.	Dain42	t1_dawj40g

The only thing keeping me away from Google WiFi are a couple little features like DDNS (though I could just set up a daemon for that), and some of the more fine-grained control that other devices give you. Though, I'm more and more inclined to use stuff at home that "just works".	Dain42	t1_dawm9px

Of course I'm talking out of my ass here, I have no clue if the router would actually disallow a blocked account from accessing the internet.

It's not a matter of being "bothered" to learn how things work. There is only so much time in the day, and plenty of people work difficult, demanding jobs and don't want to have to come home and research the finer points of wireless networking. People only have so much time in a day and only so much room in their brain attics.  There are many, many, many people out there who don't have the best technology skills, and most router setup processes are at a level above the competency of the average user (those that I've seen that aren't often leave a system that's not set up very well or has an insecure setup). Anything that makes it easier for someone to be self-sufficient on stuff like this is good.  &gt; Of course I'm talking out of my ass here, I have no clue if the router would actually disallow a blocked account from accessing the internet. Logically I don't see why it would, it's just a thought that occurred to me.  Yes. You are talking out of your ass. Because that's insane. The router has no idea what Google account an individual device that's connected might be using, because *all of that information is sent between the device and Google via HTTPS*. Not to get too rude, but maybe *you* are the one who should "be bothered to learn how things like Wifi and networking even work" before you slag on other people for not knowing.	Dain42	t1_dayawpp
t3_5gz8dt	t1_daybk42	1481226197	There are easy ways to fix the issues you are having. I'm going to use the asus 68u for this example. You setup the primary as you normally would. Then on each of the others you make them Access points not repeaters. When you do this you make sure they have all the same names and you can have 1 network through out your home / office that you don't need to worry about disconnects from.   I have 3 in my house and I can pickup wi-fi at a significant distance from my house. I have almost a dozen setup like this in another location and everyone of them acts as if its one large network not multiple points.	Talamakara	t1_dax52ct
t3_5gz8dt	t1_daybko8	1481226215	Yes, but people who have been suspended have almost inevitably *done something to justify the suspension*. If you act normally and don't do anything nefarious, you'll be fine. If you're worried about getting an account compromised, turn on two factor authentication and use Google Authenticator.

Which was the account I was speaking about, which would have made more sense if, again, you had bothered to read the article. I guarantee the device knows about your google account.

t3_5gz8dt	t1_daybszw	1481226479	Yes for the most part, I've seen people lose access to their account simply because it was compromised and whoever did the compromising did something with it that was against the TOS. Even in that event it *is* possible to regain access.	zushiba	t1_daybko8
t3_5gz8dt	t1_daybv0r	1481226543	&gt; I could teach a monkey to set up a router, it's not that hard  I'll send you some of my users from work sometime.

t3_5gz8dt	t1_dayc5gc	1481226872	It could just be hardware issue. I have the TP-Link Archer C7 and it has the WDS setting for this purpose. There is no access point or repeater settings. I do name all network the same name as well. I've also had an issue where the device would automatically connect to the 2.4 Ghz network instead of the 5 Ghz network when they were named the same, even when the 5 Ghz network is faster. So I had to name them differently. These routers are half the price of Asus ones, I guess you get what you paid for. My plan is to sell them and get the Google Wifi, once more reviews are out.	metabug	t1_daybk42
t3_5gz8dt	t1_daycxii	1481227762	Ahh you have a small break here. You are creating three networks, which is why you are having disconnect issues. When you create an access point, the primary router sees the AP (access point) as an extension of itself. So very similar to the google "mesh" system where it sees itself as one network. In your scenario it's like having three connections to the internet with the same name, which is part of why you are having issues with connectivity.     Yes you definitely do get what you pay for. I bought the routers I have specifically for the ability to have custom firmware and the super strong antennas as well as the ability to link all three into one network.   [The TP-Link forums seem to say you can use your router as an access point.](http://forum.tp-link.com/showthread.php?51595-Archer-C7-as-access-point-only)	Talamakara	t1_dayc5gc
t3_5gz8dt	t1_dayd3pl	1481227963	It requires a connection to your Google account at all times.  It's not about Google it's about other parties obtaining that information from the first line of defence since it requires it, where others don't.	SeeSickCrocodile	t1_dayagfu
t3_5gz8dt	t1_daye288	1481229068	Being a jack-of-all-tech, I can definitely see the upside to having a pre-built system ready for you to plug and play, esp for those who's networking skills are minimal or less, as well as the easy setup of repeaters where getting them working is only just slightly more complicated than turning them on.   &amp;nbsp;  I think my biggest beef would the constant need to have it connected to google. I'm not worried about privacy at this point, i'm just thinking of the control you lose over the device itself.   &amp;nbsp;  I built my own home network and several others as well as corporate level networks, and I know that certain times equipment has a certain functionality I want that a company does not. So in this case if you have a feature on your google router that you like that google doesn't for what ever reason and they remove that feature, you are SoL but to live with it. Where as on my own routers they don't get updated or changed unless I want them too.   &amp;nbsp;   You could theoretically even compare this back to the days when the PS3 had the ability to change it's OS and sony removed that option and you were stuck but to live with it.    &amp;nbsp;  I also think this isn't going to get near as much traction as google wants until they can convince the ISPs of the world to stop including all in one routers and bridging so you can build your own network. I had to fight to get my ISP to give me just a modem and it took me going up the corporate ladder bitching to do so.	Talamakara	t3_5gz8dt
t3_5gz8dt	t1_dayen9i	1481229738	I'm not really sure how other parties are supposed to obtain that information. Any account-identifying traffic that goes between you (or your router) and Google is sent via HTTPS; they're very good about this. And if someone is able to get around that and obtain identifying information, they'd be able to do it and track you when you connect to your Google Account from your phone or laptop or tablet, too. And Android phones are all connected to your Google Account at all times, too.  Are you implying that if someone were to breach the router, then they could collect this? Because they could do that anyway, were they to breach your router, and much more serious things, to boot.  I really just don't see how, if you already have a Google Account, having one more device in your home attached to it is going to increase your exposure or "trackability", especially with regards to third parties.  Remember that the router doesn't send any of your traffic to Google. It still works like a normal router, contacting sites on its own, independent of Google. It does send channel and device information needed for the router's management software, and that is all transmitted securely. In that way, it's no more risky than using a Meraki device. Just a lot cheaper and more friendly to average users.	Dain42	t1_dayd3pl
t3_5gmycw	t1_dayf6zr	1481230363	&gt; how would a home based sysadmin manage network problems for his parents?  He wouldn't. That's the appeal. Plenty of us don't want to have to maintain a second (or third) network in our down-time. That's the reason that I considered getting a Google WiFi for mine: so they're not dependent on me should something slightly screwy happen. And if they need more help, they can [just call Google, 24/7.](https://madeby.google.com/wifi/support/)  &gt; Sure it might need a wee bit more work setting up,  And that "wee bit" of setup is more than any average home user is going to be able to figure out or do. Most consumer grade routers are too much for average home users. Not every product is for you. Some products are made for people with less technical proficiency than you. Some are made for people with more. That's why a variety of different products get made: different products are good for different things.	Dain42	t1_dav8hv4
t3_5gz8dt	t1_dayg1q4	1481231351	How is this any different from any other router?  Honestly given Google's strong track record on fixing vulnerabilities and putting out frequent updates for products, you're probably less likely to see vulnerabilities on this router than on most others, especially given their clear intent to add features to it over time. You can see from [the release notes](https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/6367087?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6246512) that they've kept a pretty regular schedule.  I mean, consider that most routers require the user to actively go out, find the firmware, then apply the update themselves. And plenty more don't get more than one or two updates post-release, let alone any kind of long term support. Current consumer routers are some of the worst devices out there security-wise. Google would have to really screw up *very* badly to make something worse.	Dain42	t1_dayfc5h

t3_5h08kk	t1_db18nma	1481405173	What if accidentally overfeed? Underfeed? In soil, if you overwater once your plant will die and it's very easy to do. Does your strain like more K or N in bloom? What about hermaphroditism if you have light leaks? What if your light timer or water pump fails? What about pests like spider mites? What if your carbon scrubber isn't big enough for the strain or fails? What size fan do you use for your cabinet for proper airflow? If you run more than 1500w in lights you'll need an electrician to install circuits or it's a fire risk. Etc etc etc. There are a lot of little things people don't think about that can go wrong.	rjove	t1_db17vgg
t3_5h08kk	t1_db19cuq	1481406185	Literally all of that is thoroughly explained in like just about every single how to grow book I have ever read.   The first time I grew weed it was outdoors with hose water, the last time I grew was indoors with a fully automated system yield 400+ grams per plant.

t3_5gmycw	t1_db1yzhi	1481456008	Considering they use similar encryption methods as WLAN, but have a far more limited range, which basically stops at the connection trunk, they *are* secure.

t3_5gmycw	t1_db3cuk9	1481535044	&gt; Lol what? You realize a lot of homes even modern don't have Ethernet jacks right? And lots of power line adapters have encryption off by default or using weak passwords if any.   Sorry, I was not Aware we were talking about crappy products here, because every single Powerline product lineup from the "big" companies does work like this.  &gt; You're saying a router from the factory is secure because it's password is set. Too bad you can easily force this password.   No, I'm saying it'S secure becasue the Powerline encryption is randomised on Setup, and even *if* a router is delivered with a preset Password, that is usually an individual code for *this* router.  &gt; Also you can access it from the outside if there's a outlet. You know, something incredibly common.    I have no idea of your living conditions, but every outside power outlet I have ever seen was behind a physical lock *and* had to be explicitly turned on from the inside.  &gt; Edit:  &gt;  &gt; Also disabling the "wps equivelant" isn't exactly possible unless you can set a custom password that can be cracked pretty easily.   I think this function is listed as "push-button connect" or similar, and yes, you can disable it. You can disable *all* device Buttons and LEDs, in fact.  &gt; Also just because you can't access your WLAN from outside doesn't mean I can't with a high gain antenna.   That was my Point. my WLAN *can* be accessed from outside the house, unlike Ethernet and Powerline.  &gt; As for Ethernet, you can also use mac filtering, most homes don't have sockets because wireless is popular, and some routers have the ability to disable ports not in use.   Please, are you seriously pretending a MAC filter offers any Kind of additional security, even after you already said that WLAN Passwords can be cracked?  &gt; Powerline adapters are worse than WiFi in almost every way. They are less secure, slower, good ones cost more than a good router. They're good for when you can't make WiFi breach the area that you want it to.   My pretty cheap set (~60€ in total) reaches at least 300MBit/s consistently within the same power phase, and at least 150 across different phases, for both directions independently, while WLAN n, the currently most wide-spread Connection Standard, reaches *up to* 300MBit/s in perfect conditions, which have to be shared between *all* Connections. I hope you can figure out by yourself which is faster.  &gt; You ever wonder why they're not popular? It's because they're crap. But it gets better! They operate by introducing high frequency rf into your power lines. The fun doesn't stop there! Your walls aren't made of grounded metal now are they? If not enjoy the interference the lines now generate to devices near the walls containing powerlines with these adapters.   I have no idea what Kind of highly sensitive Equipment you have set up, but a few MHz of a low-intensity carrier wave on top of the 50Hz Signal barely Show up on an oscilloscope directly connected to the line. The AC hum is *much* more significant as far as interference is concerned.  &gt; WiFi is at least 2.4/5 ghz. Not something in the few hundred megaherts range. Not much for it to interfere with.   Except for any other WLAN, microwave ovens, wireless headphones...  &gt; Still it gets better! They're only reliable in newer homes with newer wiring and no cheap electronics plugged in. Your $40 microwave will inherently generate some noise on the power lines too as will many things that will cause interference with the adapters.   Switching power supplies do diminish the Signal Quality, but only if they are near the uplink devices. Please look up the frequnecy home microwave ovens operate at.  &gt; They're insecure garbage. I'd rather have WiFi with peap.   PEAP is not a significant Technology in the consumer sector yet. I'd prefer optical fibres all over my house.	Thaliur	t1_db3cb86
t3_5gmycw	t1_db3oyqb	1481560072	&gt; If you're shelling out that money WiFi or wired is still a better option. Also being big brand enterprise hardware doesn't make it inherently more secure.  I don't consider 60€ for the whole set a lot of money considering I save myself the trouble of running cables all across the house. I'd like to know where you got the idea of big brand enterprise hardware though, because I was referring to the more widespread consumer brands like devolo or AVM.  &gt; Too bad a lot of the time the preset password is easily forced. I believe it was dlink where the password was based on the ssid. Still insecure. Not to mention nothing stops me from jamming the two power line adapters then when they go to reconnect become part of the network.   May I suggest learning to actually read things? You keep bringing up preset passwords, while I am trying to point out that there are none in case of the usual consumer brand Powerline adapters.  &gt; It's pretty common practice to have a cgi / cgfi receptical in a water poof casing here in Canada.   OK, so maybe the outlet is accessible. That does not change anything about the difficult to circumvent encryption.  &gt; Not on all devices.  OK, so it helps to actually look for decent hardware, as usual.  &gt; And its been proven by reaver that disabling the Hutton doesn't alley as disable the feature.   is this even English?   &gt; Power line can be accesses from the outside in normal places with normal outlets.  No. Because of, and I'm slowly getting tired of repeating this **ENCRYPTION**.  &gt; mac spoofing is much harder if you can't see the other devices until the router recognizes your mac address. Some router firmwares let you decide if the mac has to be for WiFi or lan too. Iirc openwrt had that functionality.   Cracking a WLAN password or the Powerline encryption is also much harder if you don't know them before. If you consider brute-forcing randomised encryption patterns easy, I wonder how you can call getting a matching MAC difficult, especially considering the first half is relatively easy to guess.  &gt; Congrats on living in a modern house where multiple sockets tail off the same power line. Also your phases remark makes no sense.  If you think this doesn't make sense, we can stop talking now because you apparently don't know even the most basic thing about household power connections.  &gt; If we don't cherry pick though with WiFi and yse unique cases, most people get better WiFi than better powerline adapters as evident by Google. Not to mention with wireless ac taking off fast it's hard to compete.   Powerline adapters with the rated speeds of ac are already available and barely more expensive than the slower ones, and they *still* have the benefit of a less occupied medium, and considering ac runs at 5GHz, much higher range in most buildings.  &gt; Radios? Literally anything that relies on the fact that 60hz ac is generally expected to be noise free in 2016? Not to mention it will show on a oscilloscope but that shows your understanding of rf. 50hz and 300mhz will show clearly as their carrier frequencys don't align. So when they oscilate out of sync. Not to mention its not a few mhz, it's. Ages hundred.   Are you at all aware of the amplitudes involved? I highly doubt that. Not even an ECG will show the Powerline superposition. Even then, you will barely find any device that actually uses the power net frequency as a timer if the timing is at all important.  &gt; Except for the fact that you have channels for wlan where they can Odyssey a few mhz. Modern microwaves tend to not interfere unless you have the router on top of them thanks to better shielding than in the past plus they don't use noisy transformers anymore.  Great, so they also do not interfere with Powerline at all. Thank you for countering your own argument.  &gt; Also Bluetooth tends to not use frequencies that would interfere with WiFi in the 2.4ghz spectrum. They also use much weaker transmitters and now don't transmit as much thanks to Bluetooth le. And that only affects 2.4, not 5ghz   Still, on both frequency bands, you will have other WLAN networks, and have to share the bandwidth between all, and the different channels barely help, because their influence will also diminish the signal to noise ratio on at least the two neighbouring channels up and down, as any moderately good router will be able to illustrate.  &gt; I don't think you understand how pose like transmitters work. They're not wireless. They use rf over your power lines... And again modern microwaves are better than ever for noise.   I know very well how Powerline transmitters work. Switching power supplies introduce more interference into the power network than anything else you could connect, as easily shown when using old DC-&gt;AC converters. Connect a switching power supply, and the frequency will become so instable that barely anything will continue to work.  &gt; You wanted to use big commercial adapters so I'm using big commercial standards. Not to mention fiber around the house would be pointless since you can push 10gb/s over Ethernet now.   Again, I said nothing about big commercial adapters. I have no idea where you got that idea. I have been talking about normal household equipment you can buy at the next electronics shop.	Thaliur	t1_db3d8yu

They've been known to have subpar consumer PC lines. Another good example is the Alienware line that they acquired. At one point it was considered the highest tier gaming PC line you could buy pre-built. Dell bought them out and now they charge a decent bit more for that line when other companies sell higher end for less. Dell has been known to screw up equipment that was considered good, if not great. This just shows it continues to happen.	Valgarr	t1_db6prp6

For those of you considering trading in your 2- or 3-monitor setup for a more compact 21:9: I don't recommend it. Multi-monitor style window layout in the ultrawide's large, continuous space is quite difficult.  It's a lot more elegant looking on my desk, and I don't miss the bezels, but meh.

t3_5ia6jk	t1_db6uk4e	1481733982	I have the U3415W and absolutely love it. It's great for software development, allowing me to have two documents open side-by-side without needing have a dual-monitor setup (which this actually replaced).  Games that support the ultra-wide resolution are great too because you won't have the bezels right in the middle of the display. With the dual-monitor setup, I would run eve online on either a single monitor, or stretch it across the two, and then offset the center of the display. No more!

t3_5ia6jk	t1_db6wfnv	1481736206	I just recently got a  U3415W, it is a fantastic monitor and has a 0 stuck pixel warranty. I am sure the newer version is nice as well. But beware of Dell support. I had exchange my first one for pixel defects (3 of them). The support was beyond a joke. It is offshore and they don't give a flying fuck nor do they understand much beyond the script they work off of. First person said they do not offer stuck pixel warranty, even though the website and the goddamn box says so (and anyone that buys dell ultrasharps knows it is a selling point). 2nd person needed a picture, I sent it and it clearly showed the issue , yet they ask what is the defect. Third person finally opened my claim but did not setup the shipment correctly. Forth person fixed the shipment issue but sent it ground while the warranty offers next business day. After five people and 2 hours I finally get tracking and my monitor set for the next day. I would see if best buy has it locally if pixel defects are an issue as if you buy through them then dell has you return to store during warranty period for pixel defects. Best buy sucks but still better than dell shitty ass support. Great monitor now that I got a good one. Stuck pixels are way more annoying than dead ones and even at that res you could clearly see them on dart scenes.	tails_the_gay_fox	t3_5ia6jk

t3_5ia6jk	t1_db6xx8v	1481737960	Yeah. This is an ultrawide. 1440p applies to both. You just have to factor in the screen ratio to get the horizontal pixel count.	DoomBot5	t1_db6xqy5
t3_5ia6jk	t1_db6xyls	1481738005	I was on the fence about an UltraWide, but ultimately couldn't justify the price, so I opted for a 27" 1440p Acer K272HUL from Amazon. I've had great experience with it and for 1/3 price of the ultrawides.  I use it for web/email and engineering/design applications. It probably wouldn't be for high end gaming, but great on my Mac mini.	mundaneDetail	t1_db6x510
t3_5ia6jk	t1_db6xzxt	1481738048	Samsung is Korean, but I said panel, not monitor.  I think LG and Samsung are the only ultrawide panel makers.  Dell, Asus, Acer, ect all buy their LCD's from them.	Dhrakyn	t1_db6wr27
t3_5ia6jk	t1_db6y9cu	1481738352	I'm at 1440p, can't imagine going back to 1080. The problem is 100+hz @ 1440p doesn't seem to be a priority and the ones that are out are insanely priced.	greennalgene	t1_db6tuuq

t3_5ia6jk	t1_db6ysaj	1481738971	&gt; Multi-monitor style window layout in the ultrawide's large, continuous space is quite difficult.  I'm not sure what you mean by that... I also have a U3415W and I regularly run 3-4 windows at the same time, effectively mimicking a dual monitor setup. I use WinSplit Revolution for window management, it's super easy and effective at moving, re-sizing and organizing windows using keyboard shortcuts.  I agree that without WinSplit it wouldn't be nearly as good as a multi-monitor replacement though.	MorgothEatsUrBabies	t1_db6t6zm
t3_5ia6jk	t1_db6yukd	1481739045	Amazon had a sale.   They're the same monitor.  Same panel, same electronics.  If one aesthetic appeals more to you or the price is better, go with it.	Dhrakyn	t1_db6yaoh
t3_5ia6jk	t1_db6zf1b	1481739704	It's ultrawide,  don't use 16:9 nomenclature for ultrawide. Just state the actual resolution in cases like this.   If it were advertised as a 1440p monitor and someone bought it to hook up say a console, they'd be very unhappy about the stretched out image until someone told them how to force perspective and explain to them what they actually bought.	DarkSideofOZ	t1_db6xx8v
t3_5ia6jk	t1_db70ibi	1481740953	It's not "using 16:9 nomenclature" it's how screens are rated. This applies to 4:3 monitors as well. The word ultrawide tells you the ratio, so you are able to calculate the width. The same applied to 16:9 monitors, they were referred to as "widescreen" telling you it was not a 4:3 monitor.	DoomBot5	t1_db6zf1b
t3_5ia6jk	t1_db70iow	1481740966	Are they ever gonna make monitors +27 inches that aren't ultra wide?	Big_Toke_Yo	t3_5ia6jk
t3_5ia6jk	t1_db70x3h	1481741415	I respectfully disagree.  I think DDM does it's job well, and haven't had any issues with it yet.  Being able to create custom layouts is a huge plus.  Also since having the UW at home, and going to work where I have 2 monitors, I much prefer the UW.  It's so much cleaner and requires less head turn.  Bezels are the worst.	crash1082	t1_db6t6zm
t3_5ia6jk	t1_db71nzt	1481742258	I have tried a few helpers, but I don't think I've tried WinSplit yet.  One big issue is using apps which create many child windows (such as Maya or 3DS, sometimes with 10-15 child windows at any given moment). With multi-montor, the child windows are created relative to the monitor's upper left corner, which keeps everything grouped accordingly. With a single ultra-wide, child windows may spawn anywhere across the entire desktop. It's like herding cats.	shea241	t1_db6ysaj

t3_5gmycw	t1_db73q7l	1481744576	How do you define "business grade and up"? Just to be on the same page here, because I do not define it as "I could literally walk into the next electronics store and buy a set for less than 100€". I am actually pretty sure there are no business grade Powerline network systems, as anyone in the target audience for business grade hardware (businesses, mostly) is likely to not care a lot about cable guides running along walls, or adding wiring in walls and floor, to use Ethernet cables. Powerline systems are intended for people who, for whatever reason, cannot or do not want to run cables between the points they want to connect. That is really their main purpose.  The devices I have mentioned are available at relatively low cost for everyone, easily serviced without any additional education or special instruction, and make use of several techniques (like using all three connectors for communication instead of only two, as was normal a few years ago) to ensure a decent connection. The connection quality itself, as well as the phase traversal, is mostly governed by physics, as with all network technology, and may in fact be different for different building. Actually, they are almost guaranteed to be different for different buildings.  I wouldn't call 30 years old power cables new wiring either, to be honest. I'm honestly getting the impression that we are talking about completely different and unrelated things here.	Thaliur	t1_db731ko

t3_5ia6jk	t1_db74kam	1481745513	I'd have to disagree. If you're actually looking to buy an ultra wide this is actually pretty helpful because it discusses how to it stacks up to competitors and points out that you probably shouldn't buy it.	Cornpicker	t1_db6r1dc
t3_5ia6jk	t1_db7526z	1481746068	You're liking it versus dual monitors? I've suggested for our next round of monitor purchases to move to a single 34" or maybe 29" instead of our typical dual 22".	durable2	t1_db6ls3n
t3_5ia6jk	t1_db76ah8	1481747456	Correct, I was worried moving from two 24s to the one 34. Got used to it after a day or two. Glad I made the switch. Tons of screen real estate and less desk clutter. Got rid of the cables/stand of one monitor and my speakers. The built in speakers are good enough to replace the $20 Logitech set I was using.	Koonce	t1_db7526z
t3_5ia6jk	t1_db7a7of	1481751809	I've been concerned about this, as I often need to share my screen.  Does the software that you use have an option to just share a single application, as opposed to the entire screen?  I wonder if it would be more usable that way.	jhole	t1_db6s58c
t3_5ia6jk	t1_db7aqco	1481752381	Yes, sharing a single application (webex) seems to work just fine, but it's tough if you have a need to switch applications often during a presentation.	manfredpanzerknacker	t1_db7a7of

t3_5igmyf	t1_db8cahr	1481818680	I can tell you right now that this platform is poorly optimized (mechanically) for 3d printing. Most 3d printer designs attempt to reduce the amount of mass that moves because the extruder head does a ton of back and forth movements very quickly. We're talking about speeds of 150 mm/s+ or 350 ipm+.  I guarantee this thing can't move that fast.  Looks good for pick and place though although I cant imagine why the average person would need a one outside a production environment.	Potoodles	t3_5igmyf

You would need 3 shifts at $10 per hour stuffing envelops constantly 7 days a week to match the productivity of a mail machine (not that these would make a good mail machine but that's beside my point) it would cost $1,680 per week to do the same amount of work, even if your mail machine had to be replaced monthly only an idiot would hire people instead of buying the robot.	iCameToLearnSomeCode	t1_db8ij25

t3_5igmyf	t1_db8njou	1481831882	You will need to factor in maintenance costs - the thing is going to need to be fixed now and then.  You can't have a tech standing around waiting for it to break or malfunction and then pay for 10 minutes of work.  You'll also need to consider how you'll get the materials to the envelope stuffing machine, which may involve more machines and a conveyor belt and someone stocking huge loads of supplies into a hopper that drops on the conveyor belt... and now you have at least one person working on loading supplies and a tech and with a hopper / feeder / belt / stuffer setup you have a lot more points of failure.  So how many envelopes do you actually need to stuff?  Because here's a [$4600 device](http://www.whitakerbrothers.com/formax-6102-folder-inserter) that will do almost 1400 pieces in an hour.

t3_5igmyf	t1_db8ptrb	1481834556	Makerbot used to be a driving force in open source 3D printing at one point. Open source, if you don't know, means that all of the design files are available to the public, so people can modify their printer and collaborate to make the design better, as well as build their own machine without even buying the parts from Makerbot.  At one point, the CEO of Makerbot decided that he wasn't Steve Jobs enough. He made the next generation of Makerbots closed source with proprietary software, sleek designs, and mediocre hardware. The new machines were a "fuck you" to the community that fueled Makerbot, and they were aimed more at average consumers who don't even want/need an overpriced 3D printer. Applying Apple's design philosophy to something as niche as 3D printing was definitely a mistake.	iamtherealdylan	t1_db8pbq9

t3_5j52xm	t1_dbdz181	1482169959	I'm looking for an ideally cheapish tablet for media consumption (YT, Twitch, Spotify, Browsing). I've seen the fire HD 8/10 and the lenovo S8-50. Size doesn't matter a ton, nor does pixel count or gimmicky features.  What's the best out there for this use? The FireOS' locked down nature means I wouldn't be able to get Twitch and YT without sideloading. Does that carry any ramifications?  I have a nexus 7 2013 and really love it, but it's on its last legs. The 3.5mm only works if I hold it a certain way, the charging port only works if the wire pulls it down slightly, the battery goes down while charging if I use it... Yeah.  Also glancing at the Chuwi tablets, they're interesting. Pretty much well suited to my tastes and W10 is a nice touch but performance is reportedly not good. Anything similarly priced but with more solid specs? Though I suppose  given that W10 is a paid license, they'll tend to cost more than Android/Linux tablets.	whatevernuke	t3_5j52xm

t3_5j52xm	t1_dbe2et7	1482174020	I have a last-gen Fire HD8. It is fairly slow so you won't want to multi-task much. I also loaded Google Play Framework on it to run Google apps and it worked fine but you will quickly run out of storage (mine is 8GB) so get the larger capacity one.  The low resolution is fine for video but for detailed images and small text (such as maps) it is noticeable.  Don't forget to check out last year's versions of higher end tablets. They probably have better specs for near the same price.	Cali_Hapa_Dude	t1_dbdz181
t3_5j52xm	t1_dbe6rtn	1482179123	Hey, all!  I'm looking for a PC/tablet that can:  1) play media such as Spotify, YouTube, Netflix 2) Download 20+ MB audio files 3) Do some data analysis in Excel and possibly Tableau and R (nothing too heavy)  Don't need it to do any of these 3 things incredibly well. But I've tried using Excel on my brother's iPad and it's a total mess compared to how it works on my work PC. So I'm looking for something that has the portability of a tablet, but can flip to being more of a computer when I'm studying or doing some data analysis on the side.   Can anyone recommend some products that suit this criteria at a good value? I'm hoping to spend $800ish or less, but I'm a complete consumer electronics noob, so I don't know how feasible that is.

t3_5j52xm	t1_dbeb896	1482184137	I need help finding a gift for a person. She wants to write short stories, but feels like she doesn't have enough time to sit down at a computer and type. She says she would prefer to dictate, and have some device or program to transcribe her speech. I don't think she would mind editing her stories later for punctuation and the like.  I have recommended that she use Google docs on her Android phone, and just press the microphone button on the keyboard. She has tried this a few times, but she gets frustrated when she accidentally taps the screen and closes the microphone, or her screen turns off. Also, she can't really go through all the steps of opening the program and getting it into dictation mode while she's driving; she wants to just push a single button and have something start transcribing.  I don't know exactly what to look for. I don't know if I should be trying to find some special microphone that pairs with a transcription app, or some software that will transcribe from a previously-recorded sound byte, or what. So, I turn to you! What ideas do you have for helping my friend transcribe her impromptu dictated stories?  Thank you!	ErikThePirate	t3_5j52xm

I don't use any window management tools, but usually use the Windows hotkeys to arrange my work.  If you have a multimonitor setup, Win key + Shift + L/R arrow will move windows between your different monitors, while U/D arrow maximizes or minimizes it.  The same hotkeys work for my 3415, except it knows and snaps the windows into halves or quadrants when I use that combo. Have you tried that?  A combination of alt-tabs and that combo allows me to manage my windows without any additional software.	AznSzmeCk	t1_db6t6zm

I'd like a cheap tablet and keyboard attachment for writing (mostly on transit or on lunch break). It would need a decent word processor app and the ability to handle large word documents and PDFs (well over 100 pages).   * Location: Canada * Budget: max $300, the lower the better * Good battery and keyboard are highest priority. Basic gaming capability would be nice, but optional. * Lighter is better but weight is low priority. * Android preferred due to experience, as long as there's a half-decent word processor available.  * Screen size mostly irrelevant. * Must handle large file word processing / PDF viewing.

t3_5j52xm	t1_dbh8y1z	1482353702	I recently purchased my fiance the Fossil Q Marshall smartwatch for Christmas since I  knew itd match his style, but I'm second guessing its functionalty now considering he currently uses an iPhone 6. While the Watch does support iOS 8.2+, I read (through a very slim amount of reviews relevant to my concern) that its very limited functionalty in to comparison if he had an Android phone. Would it be worthwhile to return it and get him an Apple Watch 2 instead? It was roughly the same price, but the Apple watch doesnt nearly look as nice.	totallynotbree	t3_5j52xm

t3_5j52xm	t1_dbhw11v	1482388319	It kinda depends on what he would need from the smartwatch. If he is just interested in basics like getting notifications then it should be fine.  Basic fitness tracking on Android Wear should work fine too. I personally don't see a need to have anything more than basic features on a smartwatch since the phone isn't too far away anyways. If it were me I would prefer the Fossil Q over the Apple watch.  For me, a watch is a piece of jewelry that I want to look good. The Fossil Q just looks much better. Basic smart functions are all I need. I'd rather pull the phone out of my pocket to answer than talk to my wrist.	evilr2	t1_dbh8y1z

You can argue semantics all you want, but we all know what people mean when they say "weed is legal in xyz state". You really think it's necessary for people to literally spell out "XYZ state is a state in which there is no state law prohibiting weed but buy the way it's still federally illegal" every time we try to have a discussion about weed laws?

OLED delivers the picture quality of plasma and then some, including deep, dark blacks and wide viewing angles.  I think in Plasma vs LCD, the inferior product won.  I have never been a fan of LCD or LCD-LED televisions. I see inaccurate colors, motion artifacts and unnatural movement on the screen, fuzzy parts of the screen, and unnatural contrast. My plasma always looks wonderful, with accurate colors, perfect motion rendition and a lifelike look that LED-LCD cannot match.  So when it is time to replace my Panny VT 55" plasma, OLED will be the choice for me (assuming it is available and affordable at that time).	Undertaker59	t1_dbiw1ts

The hardware will work for a long time without much need for care, and the updates, when they need to happen, are straightforward and easy as well.   Now the added bonus is, with an Apple device, all other apps like Whatsapp and Duo work as well. If no cellular is the aim, Skype can work, although I don't like it as much compared to the competition. Facebook Messenger also works without need for cellular, but it is basically as bad as Skype, AND the user interface is apalling.

Definitely still getting updates. Just because they're targeting other markets (especially India) with Allo, it doesn't mean Hangouts is gone.  **Google+:** also still going and getting updates, even if few people use it.  **Nexus:** sort of gone, replaced by Pixel, but still getting OS upgrades and monthly updates as promised. Nowhere near "abandoned".  Yes, with some products, especially new ones, Google has a wall-spaghetti approach, but if we're being honest, the vast majority of Google products are well-supported over a very long period of time. Even the completely unprofitable Reader was kept going as long as they could reasonably do, and when they cut it, they gave people *plenty* of notice and made it easy to transfer all current subscriptions to other services.

t3_5l945z	t1_dbu7yjk	1483206653	Article says DNG files are smaller and easier to work with, but I've worked with both and haven't noticed a difference.  That said, I wonder what kind of files sizes the new 5D4 or 5DS make. If there's a significant difference, maybe it's worth expirimenting with. This is all peanuts compared to the possibility of raw video from the 5D3 somewhere in the future, though.	gnashville	t1_dbu3wyo
t3_5l945z	t1_dbu84yx	1483206913	I presume the relevant point is the one immediately before the piece you quoted: &gt; Compared to the proprietary RAW formats used by camera manufacturers (like Canon’s CR2), Adobe’s open DNG format is smaller and easier to work with in programs like Lightroom and Adobe Camera Raw.  So DNG might be easier to work with because it generates smaller files than CR2.  [This](http://petapixel.com/2015/07/16/why-i-stopped-using-the-dng-file-format/), for example, says that DNG achieves a "15-20% reduction in file size over proprietary raw files". It also raises some issues about DNG files - particularly when used with Capture One, though that [seems to have been addressed](http://captureoneblog.com/capture-one-9-review/) from version 9. The author of the PetaPixel article mentions that in the comments to [this look at the pros and cons of DNG](http://petapixel.com/2015/12/08/dng-the-pros-cons-and-myths-of-the-adobe-raw-file-format/).  That file size difference might be relevant if the cost (in time and/or money) of storage or file transfer is an issue. Depending upon hardware, I guess it might also make a material difference to post-processing time.  Just from looking at those articles, whether it's worthwhile switching seems to depend upon personal workflows etc.	magicm0nkey	t1_dbu3wyo
t3_5l945z	t1_dbu9t42	1483209318	What's the advantage of this over a normal RAW. Just seems silly yaving to do an extra invert operation. And I'm pretty sure the CCDs don't capture in negative anyway.	_Mardoxx	t3_5l945z
t3_5l945z	t1_dbu9ut0	1483209386	To add to what others are saying..  Adobe tends to argue that DNG's are "better" or "easier" because while they are smaller, they are also a single file. Editing a CR2 is easy, sure, but creates a XMP sidecar file. Now you have two files to manage. DNG wraps that xmp info into the same file.  They're also a bit smaller, yes. but not always.  Also another small detail for ease, LR5 and past versions will read DNG's (but not read all current raw formats from other brands) and you can simply convert files from that 5DSr or 5D4 to DNG with their free converter if you don't want to bother upgrading to LR CC right now. (this article is saying that you would have the option to have DNG's straight outta camera, which could be handy for some)  All that said (and to ramble a little more), Adobe always points out in their demos/etc at things like PhotoPlus and PhotoshopWorld something along these lines "DNG is our (adobe's) format and we're not going anywhere. While companies like Canon and Nikon may change things on their end, our formats won't change so you know your files will always be read-by and work with our products"  That's used in arguments they make saying "use photoshop over our competition's bundled software"  So should you use DNG? Hard to say.. what's your workflow like?  Do you keep your files and masters in one spot and only ever need them on those drives/system? Or do you travel a lot and need to work on files on different systems with other people's software? If you're in the latter category, using DNG's and not needing to have a LR.cat file with you or XMP files to manage might be a good thing to try out	mostlyjustread	t1_dbu3wyo
t3_5l945z	t1_dbuaif5	1483210344	There's actually no negative/inversion involved from any technical point of view. It is just a marketing term. Adobe wants to express the idea of "Original, unprocessed, maximum information from the time of shooting." A decent analog world equivalent for that is 'negative'.  That said, I think it still sounds stupid. It *almost* feels like it is targeted at the lowest common denominator of people who can't be expected to comprehend anything involving modern technology.   I think the real selling point is that it is an open standard. You can avoid some legal and technical challenges compared to trying to make hardware/software that works with another company's proprietary format.  From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Negative :  &gt; **Freely-available specification:**[26][27][28] this can be downloaded from the Adobe website without negotiation or needing justification.[2] &gt;  &gt; **Format based on open specifications and/or standards:** DNG is compatible with TIFF/EP, and various open formats and/or standards are used, including Exif metadata, XMP metadata, IPTC metadata, CIE XYZ coordinates and JPEG.[2][29] &gt;  &gt; **Self-contained file format:** a DNG file contains the data (raw image data and metadata) needed to render an image without needing additional knowledge of the characteristics of the camera.[2][22] &gt;  &gt; **Version control scheme:** it has a version scheme built into it that allows the DNG specification, DNG writers, and DNG readers, to evolve at their own paces.[30][31] &gt;  &gt; **Freely-available source-code-based software development kit (SDK):** there are three aspects - there is an SDK; it is source-code-based (as can be verified by examination); and it can be downloaded from the Adobe website without needing justification.[32] &gt;  &gt; **Documented to have no known intellectual property encumbrances or license requirements:** there is both a "Digital Negative (DNG) Specification Patent License" which says that anyone can exploit DNG,[4] and a statement that there are no known intellectual property encumbrances or license requirements for DNG.[5] &gt;  &gt; **Lossless and lossy compression (optional):** DNG support optional lossless and (since version 1.4) also lossy compression.[33] The lossy compressions losses are practically indistinguishable in real world images.[34]	i_am_jotun	t1_dbu9t42
t3_5l945z	t1_dbub8ur	1483211400	when you edit a DNG the edits are stored within the DNG. when you edit a canon or nikon raw, the edits are stored in a different file.   It doesn't matter for adobe camera raw or lightroom, that's bullshit... they both handle the sidecar files fine. This makes it more compact and convenient for various file management programs.  For example portfolio will preview the raw files, not the raw files as modified by the XMP  It's essentially also cross platform, not requiring specific camera handling.  DNGs load /preview quicker in adobe products and are smaller.  But that's the problem. Lightroom is great... but it is no Capture One, and capture one doesn't support DNG.  Lightroom defaults to "adobe standard" which requires a lot of cajoling to get results that capture one has by default.

Random thought about the usage of negative, in analogue there was also chrome or "positive" film. They could have called it a digital positive and still been making an accurate analogy. Though if we want to get pedantic about terms, it's about as accurate as you saying CCD since most cameras (including all the popular Canon SLRs this applies to) use CMOS.	Couldbehuman	t1_dbu9t42

t3_5lffxw	t1_dbvg5ky	1483296162	If you built one today you might be able to make it work but only for a small set of TVS.

t3_5lffxw	t1_dbvg9r3	1483296319	Light guns don't work with non-CRT TVs because the timing of the flickering of the target as it is drawn on the screen is how the game determines if the light gun is actually pointed at the target or not.   Flicker sensed too soon? Not the target. Flicker sensed too late? Not the target. Only when the flicker of the screen matches the timing of your trigger pull do you hit the target.

t3_5lffxw	t1_dbvhgvi	1483297889	The old systems wouldn't work as such. But wouldn't you be able to compensate this if you build a new system? Measure the delay and read the photosensor x µs after trigger is pressed.	nuclear_faceplant	t1_dbvg9r3
t3_5lffxw	t1_dbvhhhb	1483297912	Two big reasons:  1. The original NES zapper uses a modified IR receiver chip on it that has a bandpass filter for about 15 kHz, which is roughly the horizontal refresh rate of PAL and NTSC CRT TVs, i.e., the rate at which the electron beam scans back and forth across the screen as it paints one field. That's one of the ways that the gun knows you're pointing it at a TV instead of, say, a light bulb. LCD TVs don't have an electron beam that scans back and forth, so they don't produce that 15 kHz signal, so the light that they do emit falls outside of the bandpass filter.  2. The Duck Hunt code timing is very tight, and the delay path in LCD TVs screws that up. As a rough outline, the game first debounces the zapper trigger, then paints one black field (not frame, i.e., 16.7 ms, not 33.4 ms), then paints a white rectangle at the location of the first duck for one field (not frame), then paints a white rectangle at the second duck for one field, then resumes the normal display of the meadow scene. The game looks for the black (dark) value to appear at the expected time (to verify that the gun is pointed at the screen) and then whether the white (light) signals appear at the expected times to determine if the zapper was pointed at each duck. Since modern TVs have input lags [of about 10 ms at best](http://www.displaylag.com/display-database/), the time that the relevant data appears on the screen is well after the game expects it to be there, so the game doesn't work.  However, there are ways to make this work.  First, modify the zapper to use some other signal that happens to be unique to LCD TVs.  Second, patch Duck Hunt to allow it to tolerate more delay.  Source: I'm working on a project to do exactly this. [Here's a photo of the latest rev of the modified zapper board I made with one of the original boards in the background.](http://i.imgur.com/5IgmftQ.jpg)	teuobk	t1_dbvfdsh

t3_5lffxw	t1_dbvlw97	1483303898	You can build them so that they work but you have to have software built in so that you can calibrate it to each TV set. CRT's had no image pre processing so you saw what you got as the signal was sent. LCD have preprocessing and depending on the chips and circuitry of the board in the TV it will be a different amount of time.   Thats why some TV's have a game function, it limits the preprocessing that happens to try to make the latency of what the TV puts out and what comes up on the TV as small as possible. But even still there is some. I used to play most single player games on my LCD TV as it didnt matter much but when going online I would move it to my CRT TV which helped me have a slight advantage as there was a serious delay on my LCD.   Each TV model could be slightly different and when you're talking millisecond sampling you cant make it universal, so it would need to be calibrated for each TV and even then, if you change some setting on the TV it could screw it up all over again and need to be recalibrated.

t3_5lj323	t1_dbwklbx	1483369823	Lol they started selling coolers before they got past the first 1/3 of kickstarter contributors.  Kickstarter is such a terrible idea. The entire idea is if you invest in a company and it succeeds you get your money back in the form of the product you already paid for. If it fails you get nothing.  They should remake a kickstarter that is the same idea but you buy shares of the company itself. It also needs to be way more legally binding so that investors can seek damages for all the people that make vaporware and dip with the money.	fancyhatman18	t1_dbwbi8t

t3_5lmwcq	t1_dbzcurs	1483522813	Oftentimes the QHD is the only option for higher spec versions or touch, although it seems to be different for this device at launch.  If these two are the only differing factors... yes you can tell a difference but most likely it won't matter. The main benefit is that the QHD screen uses superior Sharp IGZO tech compared to the HD which may or may not use normal IPS. This means better colors at least and probably response times as well. I have seen both on the normal XPS 13 and the IGZO is noticeably better... but do you need it? probably not.	JP2214	t1_dbyvysd

t3_5lmwcq	t1_dbzo01v	1483545718	&gt; So given the 1080p display is near identical in terms of picture quality  you notice the difference with text.  One is small and clear, the other is small and pixelated. And Ms wants to move windows away from subpixel font rendering.	surface_book	t1_dbyvysd

t3_5mcdeu	t1_dc559uv	1483844216	How is this not just a standard compass with a slightly different than normal user interface? And if so, so what?  In other words, a $1 compass could equally be described as "sensing where north is via a small metal gadget held in my hand" It just takes less time to check, which is great and all, but not any more newsworthy than any other of a million products that add a slight extra convenience to something.	crimeo	t3_5mcdeu

t3_5moknj	t1_dc58tis	1483848909	HMD have said that they plan to offer well built and designed phones at affordable prices. They [don't intend to enter a spec war](http://www.economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/nokia-handsets-to-ride-brand-recall-hmd-ceo-arto-nummela/articleshow/55808902.cms):  &gt; We are going to be extremely comeptitive in terms of the specifications and price but we're not going to be highlighting the megapixels or Ghz.  From the [press release](http://www.hmdglobal.com/press/2017-01-08-nokia-6/) on HMD's website:  &gt; With the arrival of Nokia 6, consumers will see superior craftsmanship and design quality in action. It takes 55 minutes to machine a single Nokia 6 from a solid block of 6000 series aluminium. It then receives two separate anodising processes, taking over ten hours to complete, with each phone being polished no less than five times. The end result is an aluminium unibody with the highest level of visual and structural quality.	dashingtomars	t1_dc552w8
t3_5moknj	t1_dc59wzj	1483850616	HMD Global Oy is Finnish company that was founded by ex-Nokia employers.	robinkooli	t1_dc552w8
t3_5moknj	t1_dc5cu3x	1483855790	wow! it looks like every other phone that chinese brands come up with. unprotected camera lens, edge-to-edge glass, and Dolby Atmos Audio (yeah. sure. I'd entertain it if they just said regular dolby.) It's fragile as shit, and you know it's fucking impossible to repair. Yeah, that's totally the kind of features that got people buying Nokias.  I GUESS the aluminum unibody and 2.5d glass (ugh) give it a premium feel but this doesn't look like anything more than some chinese company's attempt at a cheap but premium phone based on the Moto G4 and whatever unibody flagship is currently selling the most.

The demo video is mind blowing but AFAIK that demo is the only thing that natively supports the program.

t3_5mcdeu	t1_dc6qw37	1483938814	itt: why /r/gadgets never strays from consumer tech everyone complains about anyway, and is a boring sub to read through. in fact, you've really outdone yourselves by going for the low-hanging fruit like the dude's face instead of bitching about this thing being *$350.*  It's a proof of concept, a novel idea. It isn't supposed to replace a compass, it's supposed to make one experience having another 'sense', because it's fully automatic and, after getting used to it, it feels natural unlike looking at a watch or phone. You don't get to choose when to check where north is, just like you don't get to choose when you feel pain or heat or sound or light unless you manually impair your senses. There are obvious caveats (it should be under the skin, for one, and you don't usually need to recharge your ears via microUSB) but that comes with the territory.   Augmentation has been a hot topic the last few years with people surgically inserting magnets in their fingertips or getting NFC/RFID chips injected for a few dollars at hackerspaces.

He was a trojan horse from Microsoft. In only a couple years Nokia was destroyed and Microsoft bought them at a huge huge discount.

I wouldnt use this thing as a personal transportation device if there was any chance over .05% that it would malfunction. In other words the safety cage would not be to prevent death or serious injury from system failure resulting in both the human and the drone hurtling to the earth. It would be to prevent the operator from falling from the vehicle while it is still airborne or coming into contact with the machine and other airborne objects.	dimsumwitmychum	t1_dca5ti4

Prosecutors accuse the company of false advertising. This includes misleading customers with a promotional video whose images were not taken by a Lily drone but instead a much more expensive camera drone requiring two people to operate instead of one, according to court document."  u/adult_human was an actor for a Lily commercial and provided commentary about his or her experience in another Reddit thread.

Screen images on ads for TVs and phones are simulated.   Of course you'll want to make your product look great in ads. But putting some makeup on and getting the right lighting is much different than a complete bait and switch I'd say.   There's gotta be a line between beautifying a product, and claiming it's something it never will be. Like your NMS example, sure the cutscenes and in game graphics will be specifically selected (and sometimes simulated) in most game trailers and differ from the teaser or release ads slightly, but to claim a laundry list of features and deliver a completely different product is something else.   And that's a standard procedure we shouldn't allow to continue.	Einsteins_coffee_mug	t1_dcd3ndq

I think commercials and ads should represent the realistic presentation of the product, and this includes all industries.   And the scenes used to advertise NMS weren't just selected specifically, they were produced and had nothing to do with how the game actually worked or looked.

To clear up my poor wording perhaps, I meant that NMS differs from *most* game trailers who do use strategically rendered clips that may or may not be done using the actual game engine in the fact that the core gameplay was vastly different, not just a polishing of graphics you might not experience.   And yeah I agree, the standard of "acceptable" is already pretty low.	Einsteins_coffee_mug	t1_dcdtrq7

t3_5o9g3v	t1_dci32ue	1484585188	Hey everybody, literally never been on the sub before but I figured it'd be better for me to post in the discussion thread instead of wasting space on a self post... I have a [Yamaha receiver](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/yamaha-700w-5-1-ch-4k-ultra-hd-and-3d-pass-through-a-v-home-theater-receiver-black/5017701.p?skuId=5017701&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;ksid=92a367c6-df58-4681-a396-d2e95f6833b8&amp;ksprof_id=16&amp;ksaffcode=pg118898&amp;ksdevice=c&amp;lsft=ref:212,loc:2&amp;gclid=CMfD-_-Nx9ECFRdYDQod4wgFrg) that I pretty frequently play music through (streaming through spotify, etc.).   I was wondering if this sub could give me guidance on a good bluetooth adapter so that I can wirelessly play rather than needing to have my phone plugged into the USB port.  I was at Best Buy over the weekend and they tried to recommend me a RocketFish adapter that retailed for about $55; but searching online it looks like there are better options for cheaper.  Thanks in advance.	Harriet_Chubman	t3_5o9g3v
t3_5n829z	t1_dci4uwo	1484587341	A single good image would have sufficed.  Instead I witnessed 60 long seconds of super-dramatic music and caught so many angles of an exceptionally uninspired and static black frame with propellers.  I guess we really need video no matter what.	rdrv	t3_5n829z
t3_5o9g3v	t1_dci5wje	1484588572	Don't use Bluetooth if you can avoid it.  1. If you're married to the Apple ecosystem, just get a (refurbished) [AirPort Express](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/FC414LL/A/airport-express-base-station), which allows you to play any audio from any Apple device.  You can either connecting this using a mini TOSLink to TOSLink cable through the Audio 1 input on your receiver, or a minijack to RCA cable to the AV2 or AV3 inputs. 2. If you on the other hand are primarily an Android user and/or you use Spotify exclusively to play music, you can get a ChromeCast Audio.  It connects in the exact same manner as the AirPort Express.  Both of them will provide superior range and superior audio compared to Bluetooth.	Arve	t1_dci32ue

t3_5o9g3v	t1_dci8yvz	1484592146	Hey, everyone. Never been on this subreddit before, but I didn't know where else to turn... I'm on the hunt for a milk steamer that is not attached to an espresso machine. I run a tea bar and make a lot of masala chai lattes, london fogs, and other assorted tea lattes, and have no need for an espresso maker, nor do I desire the maintenance costs, but I need something faster than the milk frothers we have now (pitchers on hot-plate devices); they take upwards of five minutes to heat it properly. My google-fu is exhausted, and I'd love help if anyone can provide!  **EDIT:** I've found two; one from "WPM Welhome Pro" and one from "Lucklife," and both are 200v. I'm in the U.S., so regrettably I need something compatible with 120v. Thanks again!	GwenGunn	t3_5o9g3v

t3_5o9g3v	t1_dcig201	1484600283	Alright another follow up: is there a qualitative difference between going with a mini TOSLink &gt; TOSLink cable v. using a minijack &gt; RCA cable?  (Also feel free to recommend one, I have to go out and buy one either way)	Harriet_Chubman	t1_dcidc97
t3_5o9g3v	t1_dcigs9r	1484601123	Whether there is a qualitative difference depends on the DAC in your receiver, and if your electricals are to code.   Chances are that differences are slim to none, but with toslink being more immune to noise.	Arve	t1_dcig201
t3_5o9g3v	t1_dcils9z	1484606960	Yes, it's worth it but the performance won't be spectacular. Yes it will improve loading times of games but an AMD FM 6100 based system is pretty old in 2017. Head over to /r/buildapcforme.	rtechie1	t1_dci68nn

While the quality is warm, and the mild pops and crackles gives an album a certain feel to it, I buy vinyl because the artwork. It's big, bright, and bold. And it looks superb mounted on a wall, as a way to celebrate my favourite artists and the roles of their music in my life.   Two sides to the coin. You pick which one will drive the sales of this nonsense.	NotAnotherNekopan	t3_5ouo4v

t3_5ouo4v	t1_dcmo084	1484838195	I'm right there too. I love buying movie and video game soundtracks for the artwork on top of the sound. Red Dead Redemption's soundtrack is my all-time favorite and the last time I saw it on eBay it was around $400. Gustavo Santoalla created the soundtrack for The Last of Us with an onslaught of various instruments and materials, forming an absolute masterpiece for both the base game and later on the DLC.

I would love to pay someone to digitize and track-ify all my vinyl because I have no love for crackle, hiss, rumble, and skips.

t3_5ouo4v	t1_dcmune2	1484846152	Hey everyone, before you decide to answer this question that you buy vinyl because you think it's awesome and blah blah blah. **Read the damn article**. The question it is asking is why would you want to turn the analog signal you get form vinyl into a wireless digital signal. Nobody cares anymore why you decide to buy vinyl so shut up about it.	dfsjaskldj	t3_5ouo4v
t3_5ouo4v	t1_dcmuox7	1484846200	There's a good possibility there's a studio or someone with a recording setup and a decent record player that could do this for you. If not, for ~$150 of hardware and $700 worth of software you could do it yourself (main price on the software would be the recording software as well as plugins to get rid of the pops and hiss and whatnot). Either one could be cheaper, depending on the size of your record collection.	Mando_calrissian423	t1_dcmrg2b

t3_5ouo4v	t1_dcmxkrh	1484849419	To exemplify why this point is incorrect, there probably isn't a modern song release in the world that does not process sound digitally when recording. To argue the point of analogue superiority, the full production must be analogue including recording multitracks to tape or the like.  In the home, the biggest factor to sound reproduction is then speakers and amplification. Both of these produce the most noticeable differences in the audio output - very high quality kit would be needed to hear any difference.  All this aside, consider that many modern records are now being produced in small or home studios, using computers and digital equipment where the clarity of professional sample packs and digital synthesis can now exceed the quality of accessible recording equipment for live recording, digital or analogue. Furthermore, there is almost no processing we cannot replicate digitally, such as the sound profiles from tubes or hiss and pops (if you like that).  The reality is, modern vinyl emergence has nothing to do with nostalgia nor audio quality. It is a new fad in the trend of hipster, "cool", "vintage". If you love an artist, it would make just as much sense apart from buying merch, that they sell standardised sized cards (e.g. approximate size of a vinyl cover), to show off their art and/or form part of a collection that you can physically search through.  I would say most of these people would benefit from finding enough time and awareness in their life to actually sit and listen to the music for the music. That might be the one thing that keep changing vinyls forces you to do.	mookawooka	t1_dcmtuqu
t3_5ouo4v	t1_dcmxq69	1484849587	It's not negligible. All other things being equal, digital is always better sound quality.   People who buy vinyl because they think it has magical sound quality are just deluded and playing into confirmation bias.  I have a full vinyl setup, but sound quality isn't even in the list of why I do it. It's fun, tactile, has art, and forces me to listen to a whole album. It's also much more fun when friends come over.	Pinesgap_Gum	t1_dcmw61r
t3_5ouo4v	t1_dcmyddv	1484850297	&gt; While the quality is warm  ಠ_ಠ  If I hear someone describe vinyl as warm one more time, I'm gonna lose it.	vikingmeshuggah	t1_dcmerge
t3_5ouo4v	t1_dcmyk08	1484850499	Any number of reasons. Might not have it digitally. Might not want to deal with my phone and such. All you have to do is flick a Bluetooth speaker's switch on and you're connected. As for flipping the record, yeah, but that's 7 minutes from now.	rwjetlife	t1_dcmx0hk
t3_5ouo4v	t1_dcmyp6o	1484850659	Music over Bluetooth isn't nearly as bad as it used to be and some Bluetooth speakers can deliver impressive sound, at least to some one like me who can't otherwise tell the difference.   I don't have an actual stereo setup in my house, just my phone and my single speaker. But I do have Vinyl albums because I like the art.   Eventually once I buy a house and have money I do want to get a proper setup. But even then I would like to have the ability to use some wireless headphones so I don't disturb my neighbors or girlfriend late at night.   The deal breaker here is the non-replaceable needle. I don't know hi-fi sound, but I do know hardware maintenance.	Galactic_Z	t3_5ouo4v

Technics Amp that is nearly as old as me and 2 Cerwin Vega stand up speakers that can make the house rumble. Quality was never my concern, it was always atmosphere, vinyl has a warmth and nostalgia to go along with it, when people come over they always prefer for me to throw on a record. It's what they know and love, no one is an audiophile when we just want to hang out and have a couple beers.	Dazinth	t1_dcmxq69
t3_5ouo4v	t1_dcn13fi	1484853307	i agree. i am a career DJ from the 80s, and the only reason i still have any vinyl is because it's stuff that was never reissued digitally, like 12" versions or groups not popular enough to warrant a digital release, so i have to record them myself.  from time to time, i record them in pro tools, because i already paid for it back in the 90s, and i do think it's better than most other softwares i've used. but make no mistake, if this stuff was already available digitally, i would never listen to the music on vinyl.	defjamblaster	t1_dcmxq69

I recently started driving for Uber and I wanted to let my riders listen to their music on their phones, but I don't have an auxiliary port on my stereo.   I do have bluetooth, however, but I wanted to know if there was a more streamlined option than having the rider go through the process of connecting to the bluetooth each time.   Is there a bluetooth transmitter that comes with an auxiliary cable? That way I could keep the device connected to the stereo in my car at all times and my passengers could just plug their phones into it to play music, instead of connecting to the stereo.

Digital can't really be quantified, but 380kbps is comfortably over the highest available MP3 quality, more than enough for the non-discerning listener who wants to listen to the nice stack of wax they got from a parent or bought at hot topic/urban outfitters. It also lines up with the expected quality of the bluetooth speakers they'd be hooking up to, like the bigger UE Booms, standard all-in-one HiFi systems, or maybe one of the nicer Harman Kardons.  For the record, while the cartridge isn't replaceable, the stylus/needle is. Sadly it's not upgrade-able.	LatinGeek	t1_dcofspt

But if you want a *nice* MP3 player, [Fiio](http://fiio.net/en/fiio) is pretty much the only game in town anymore. The Fiio X1 2nd gen supports SD cards up to 256GB and is $100.   Your only other option is a smartphone (Windows Phone or Android) with a 256GB microSD card. Windows Phone is generally preferred because the audio stack in Android is inferior.

t3_5ouo4v	t1_dcrcekp	1485106573	Actually the digital master and the vinyl master are usually not the same.  While they may come from the same source the digital master is often more compressed than the vinyl one.  Example: http://dr.loudness-war.info/album/list?artist=bowie&amp;album=blackstar	columbiatch	t1_dcmxkrh
t3_5ouo4v	t1_dcrdyo5	1485108541	This is a completely separate point and is not necessarily true for all vinyl masters. It especially cannot be made by a single sample. The first I clicked on with earlier CDs show this, see "Rio":  Example: http://dr.loudness-war.info/album/list?artist=Duran%20Duran  The real point made by the loudness war is songs used to have extended dynamic range (back in the days where vinyl was common media format).  Overtime we have added compression and taken this away. I believe radio (especially AM) followed by the era of portable media meant it became somewhat necessary so people could hear the music. i.e. generic media shifted from bigger, high quality (expensive) systems. Maybe heavy rock/EDM influenced this too.	mookawooka	t1_dcrcekp
t3_5ouo4v	t1_dcrhgwb	1485112942	The sad fact is that it's not an isolated example but a general trend.  Furthermore vinyl limits how loud an album can be (thus how much DR compression there is).  Your example of Rio doesn't refute this trend at all, considering that if you [sort this list by date](http://dr.loudness-war.info/album/list/year?artist=Duran+Duran&amp;album=rio) the recent vinyl releases far surpass the recent digital releases.	columbiatch	t1_dcrdyo5
t3_5ouo4v	t1_dcrhr6o	1485113308	&gt; (thus how much DR compression there is)  Fundamentally wrong understanding of compression. Loudness limits the output value and therefore amplification required, not the amount of compression that can be applied.  &gt; considering that if you sort this list by date the recent vinyl releases far surpass the recent digital releases.  I was proving the point it has nothing to do with the medium. Rio on CD in 1985/1986 is *better* than the vinyl, hence the above.  &gt; The sad fact is that it's not an isolated example but a general trend  There is no evidence this is linked with the medium as I said before, it is your opinion.  It is true, media released now has low dynamic range, but this is a general trend over the past 15 years. As you pointed out, recent CD released of Rio have more compression.  However, assuming that an album released on vinyl is going to sound better and have better dynamic range than a CD is incorrect. Especially for media released years back.  Back to the main point, very, very few people who care about any of this are buying vinyl for this reason.	mookawooka	t1_dcrhgwb

t3_5ouo4v	t1_dcrqrl5	1485123704	I understand the difference between loudness and compression.  What I meant was that vinyl loudness is limited to the average loudness level (RMS), whereas CDs are limited by the peak loudness level, and this is why many albums have different masters for CD and vinyl, thus encouraging vinyl to be mastered with more dynamic range generally, though I agree that there's technically no reason why vinyl can't be mastered as poorly as digital if you simply take the CD master in cutting the vinyl due to laziness or cheapness).    My point is that generally, vinyl records have better mastering with less compression than their digital counterparts.  Of course there will be exceptions.  See this [article](http://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/q-how-does-mastering-differ-vinyl-and-digital-releases) of how they master vinyl and digital differently.	columbiatch	t1_dcrhr6o

Please take a look at: http://now.tufts.edu/articles/does-music-sound-better-vinyl-records-cds  It is a refuted claim that the mere medium changes anything. CD can technically always be better.  It's just not as cool these days and these facts are not publicised. Plus with audiophools who swear they can tell the difference... it's not worth bothering!	mookawooka	t1_dcrqrl5

Here's the text for people who are irrationally afraid to click it.*   **Ransomware app hosted in Google Play infects unsuspecting Android user**  "ALL YOUR DATA IS ALREADY STORED ON OUR SERVERS!" malicious app warned.  ^(by Dan Goodin - Jan 24, 2017 1:29pm PST)  **G**oogle Play, the official market for Android apps, was caught hosting a ransomware app that infected at least one real-world handset, security researchers said Tuesday.  The ransomware was dubbed *Charger* and was hidden inside an app called EnergyRescue, according to a blog post published by security firm Check Point Software. Once installed, Charger stole SMS contacts and prompted unsuspecting users to grant it all-powerful administrator rights. If users clicked OK, the malicious app locked the device and displayed the following message:  &gt;You need to pay for us, otherwise we will sell portion of your personal information on black market every 30 minutes. WE GIVE 100% GUARANTEE THAT ALL FILES WILL RESTORE AFTER WE RECEIVE PAYMENT. WE WILL UNLOCK THE MOBILE DEVICE AND DELETE ALL YOUR DATA FROM OUR SERVER! TURNING OFF YOUR PHONE IS MEANINGLESS, ALL YOUR DATA IS ALREADY STORED ON OUR SERVERS! WE STILL CAN SELLING IT FOR SPAM, FAKE, BANK CRIME etc… We collect and download all of your personal data. All information about your social networks, Bank accounts, Credit Cards. We collect all data about your friends and family.  The app sought 0.2 Bitcoin, currently worth about $180. In an e-mail, Check Point researchers said the app was available in Google Play for four days and had only a "handful" of downloads. "We believe the attackers only wanted to test the waters and not spread it yet," the researchers told Ars. The infection was detected by Check Point's mobile malware software, which the company sells to businesses. Google officials have since removed the app and have thanked Check Point for raising awareness of the issue.  An analysis showed that Charger checked the local settings of an infected device and wouldn't execute the app's malicious payload if the device was located in Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus. The behavior was likely an attempt to prevent the developers from facing legal actions in those countries. In the blog post, Check Point researchers added:  Most malware found on Google Play contains only a dropper that later downloads the real malicious components to the device. Charger, however, uses a heavy packing approach which [makes] it harder for the malware to stay hidden, so it must compensate with other means. The developers of Charger gave it everything they had to boost its evasion capabilities and so it could stay hidden on Google Play for as long as possible.  The malware uses several advanced techniques to hide its real intentions and makes it harder to detect.  It encodes strings into binary arrays, making it hard to inspect them.  It loads code from encrypted resources dynamically, which most detection engines cannot penetrate and inspect. The dynamically-loaded code is also flooded with meaningless commands that mask the actual commands passing through.  It checks whether it is being run in an emulator before it starts its malicious activity. PC malware first introduced this technique which is becoming a trend in mobile malware having been adopted by several malware families including Dendroid.  In 2012, Google unveiled a cloud-based scanner dubbed bouncer that was billed as a way for the company to detect malicious apps before they were made available in Play. Five years later, discovery of malicious apps like Charger are a regular occurrence. Google makes little reference to the tool these days.  The incident is the latest to underscore the risks posed by apps hosted on Google servers. On Monday, Check Point documented the return of the virulent family of Android malware known as HummingBad, which managed to get from 2 million to 12 million downloads from the marketplace before the 20 affected apps were detected and removed	NFLinPDX	t3_5q17db

t3_5o9g3v	t1_dcvsyu2	1485345053	I'm a pretty serious PC gamer, but my last upgrade didn't include a new monitor, and I'm wondering if it's time, or if it's worth holding off for a price drop on the best tech.  Currently I have two 21" HD screens. 60Hz.  I was convinced that this was absolutely sufficient and that I wouldn't ever need to go larger, higher frequency or greater resolution for a screen I'm sitting in front of.  Then I saw my friend's bigger, 4K, 120Hz screen, and WOW. Holy balls. I want.  However it cost him like £700 and I'm not really interested in dropping that much cash.   I know I definitely want to go bigger.. but I'm not sure how big I should go before it becomes too big to be practical.  And I definitely want to move up to 120Hz (at least) -- because since seeing my friends delay I can't help but feel the difference when playing fast paced games now, human eye can't detect it my ass, I can detect it.  My preliminary research on 4K+120Hz has been very high price range. Is 4K going to be necessary/noticable for a desktop solution? At what size of monitor would 4K become mandatory?  And as such should I just get a new 120Hz? Or should I wait for the 4K+120Hz combo to drop in price?  would a say.... ~30" 1080 120Hz monitor be ideal?  Any brands/products/offers people would recommend for someone in my situation who really wants to up their refresh rate, wants a marginal size increase, and is happy with 1080 but would rather have 4K if its necessary at my desired size?

t3_5q17db	t1_dcvx7yb	1485353295	In late 2013 Android OS had 88% of the world market share and iOS had 12%. People always say Apple products can't get viruses and windows/anything else can. Well that's just plain wrong. Most bad people who write malware don't want to spend their time just to affect a tiny tiny 12% of the worlds phones, so they go after android. Writing bad stuff for each OS is different but not impossible. And plus , most people (just like in this case) don't actually "hack" your device. They social engineer you into downloading something, or clicking a link, etc.	quincytwo	t1_dcvw5zd
t3_5q17db	t1_dcvxsv5	1485354139	YES YOUR PRECIOUS APPLE IPHONE CAN ALSO GET MALWARE IN THE SAME EXACT WAY.   I've had to post 2 replays already to comments about "this is why I have an iPhone". The ONLY reason you hardly hear about stuff like this happening to iOS is because they only had 12% of the worlds share in mobile OS! Android has 88%! If I'm writing malware I'm not going to spend my precious time writing it for your tiny portion of the worlds mobile devices!   Writing bad stuff is different for each OS, mobile or not, BUT IT CAN BE DONE. Security software can't pick up everything and I doubt both Google and Apple are going to pour over every app requests source code to find malware. The techniques used in this app were advanced malware hiding techniques, the security software couldn't pick them up!  Anyways, you are the biggest risk to your device. Just like in this case, the user was sort of social engineered  into clicking or downloading something malicious.  Good god I'm tired of this Apple is safer than android, no it isn't it just isn't half as popular.   Sources: [stats](https://www.google.com/amp/appleapple.top/android-is-already-more-than-87-of-the-market-share-of-ios-fell-to-12/amp/?client=safari) and am about to graduate with computer science degree, had to do a report on this stuff.

t3_5q17db	t1_dcvybc9	1485354843	I don't believe they have. Pay some money upload app, security check and it's published. This makes it easier to be sure you have a app for everything as nothing is denied.	djandDK	t1_dcvwv6h

It was fun collecting all that heavy vinyl but these days whenever I walk past it all I see the deposit on a home, or a paid debt, squandered on bulky, outdated, fancy high maintenance shit.

t3_5q17db	t1_dcw2n5f	1485360148	Apple can't review my submitted apps source code because all I give them is a binary file, and [apparently  ](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3186648/does-apple-view-the-actual-source-code-when-approving-apps)  they just scan those for use of private API's. It's always changing though. I've never written any malware myself but to put an app out there that allows access to photos, contacts, and whatever else would be easy, and then I would imagine you could just upload all that info (or as much as you can over time) to a private server. As far as displaying the "we have your stuff" message it's just some text you would put on the screen, but locking down the phone I'm not sure how to do. I mean I use Google Photos for my photo app, and it stores it all online already (but I trust google isn't going to somehow blackmail me with it).

But I think that's why it's getting impossible to buy a phone with a removable battery: only by forcing the phones to die earlier (due to the battery dying) can they keep selling new phones to people who already have a decent phone.	paffle	t1_dcy3hyz

t3_5qctjb	t1_dd0bpp3	1485580099	Your question is phrased such that it sounds like a response to the claim "Samsung already released a 4K phone."  However, the-mean-memer did not say Samsung released a 4K phone; he said "they" did.  Since the article is about Sony (and since [Sony has released a phone with a 4K display](https://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/phones/xperia-z5-premium/)), it's safe to assume Sony is the company "they" refers to, not Samsung.	gaardus	t1_dd04c50

t3_5qctjb	t1_dd1ct5w	1485649799	Unless you do content creation I'd say 4K isn't worth the upgrade. I got mine for editing photos and for that reason alone it was worth it. But gaming can be a nightmare since a beefy GPU is required for AAA games.	FigFrontflip	t1_dd0unb2

The drop tests you can look up online are highly impressive.  Battery performance is midpack but battery is replaceable.   Objectively the best audio (through the 3.5mm) of any phone ever made thanks to the quad DAC. The camera is right on par with Samsung, with a UI that surpasses it, especially for ease of use and approachability on manuel settings.  The second screen feature, IMO, is not just a gimmick.

With both of them being on ventilators to breath and seeing the amount of work it takes to ween them off of the vent, then the nippv, then a cpap, then just a nasal Cannula for oxygen, this gadget is something I would seriously consider getting to give me peace of mind. I'm no helicopter parent, but there is a strong possibility my child could stop breathing in the middle of the night or roll into a position he stops breathing normally causing his heart to become bradycardic.  Don't dismiss things like this because a normal child or parent wouldn't need it. This could save a child's life in the right circumstance. And one life saved is worth it in my opinion.	Tiz68	t1_dda592l
t3_5rtopz	t1_ddadj5l	1486143681	Maybe I would explain how this device might not have even stopped it from dying, and the child's death isn't their fault.  What about the other 99,970 parents who's fear aged them and made it so they lost sleep, and that lack of sleep harmed them in some other way (yes this does happen). So many parents getting in car crashes because they can't get a good nights sleep because they are too anxious.  Or the 99,970 parents who wasted $250 each!   At some point you just have to come to terms with it, live with the risk, understand that a reasonable person would never buy a device like this.  These are things therapy can help you realize. And these parents would realize if they went through that. It isn't their fault.	Integrals	t1_ddad720
t3_5rtopz	t1_ddadq3t	1486143892	That's 1/3,300 chance your kid will die of SIDS. To put that in perspective the chance you will die in a fatal car crash is about 1 in 5000 to15000 depending on what state you are in. Does that mean seat belts are stupid?  Babies are incredibly expensive. 250 for your kid related expenses is a drop of piss in the ocean.  That's said would I buy one?  No. But I also don't wear my seatbelt.	pharmafaggot	t1_ddadb3g
t3_5rtopz	t1_ddady5u	1486144142	Yeah we had a baby monitor for our first child. After about a month we shut it off so we could get some sleep. Turned us into nervous wrecks.	scuzzy987	t3_5rtopz
t3_5rtopz	t1_ddae5co	1486144360	Those odds are low! I must be lucky cus I know 3 people that have lost a baby to SIDS. Right before I had my first child my mom's co-worker's baby died from it. It scared the hell out of me and I bought a monitor for $100. I'm so happy I did. Read some reviews of these devices, there are several people it did help and that makes all the difference in the world.  Also, Sids has no known cause. It's not about "following the rules". The "rules" change every year. If you have a baby and it dies from SIDs, I'm glad you'd just be able to shrug it off like oh well, but don't  blame parents for actually caring about their babies.	Jennrrrs	t1_ddadb3g
t3_5rtopz	t1_ddaec1k	1486144567	Well, babies did die in the past and the parents would have no clue why, so there's that.	Jennrrrs	t1_ddacixw
t3_5rtopz	t1_ddaec6f	1486144571	And those "rules" have brought the death rate down from 200/100k to 30/100k.  So yes, following the latest rules greatly helps.	Integrals	t1_ddae5co
t3_5rtopz	t1_ddaedjc	1486144611	I think the device listed in this post doesn't have the capability but there are devices that cost less that will wake the baby if he/she stops breathing, [I use this](https://www.angelcarebaby.com/product/angelcare-ac401#) for my 4 month old and it works.  It produces an audible alarm that will wake the baby and then if that doesn't work it will alarm the handheld monitor.  There are cases out there with at risk babies that a simple 99$ device like this is a literal life saver.	shootingblank	t1_ddadb3g
t3_5rtopz	t1_ddaeeq8	1486144649	Yeah!  Haha!  I want to make sure my infant hasn't succumbed to SIDS!  Hilarious and totally overbearing!	virtualroofie	t1_dda592l

t3_5rtopz	t1_ddaeiz5	1486144780	I bought a Snuza after my mom's friend lost her baby to SIDs. It just clips onto the diaper and triggers an alarm if there is no breathing movements. You don't need a phone or anything like that for it to work.	Jennrrrs	t1_ddadfor
t3_5rtopz	t1_ddaemb6	1486144884	I had  breathing monitor. One night, it went off for my 4 month old daughter.   I go in and she's grey, not breathing at all. I pick her up, no breathing. I sort of shake her a bit ( as much as you can safely shake a baby) and she gasps and starts breathing again.   Pedi said she must have thrown up in her sleep, and her airway shut off to prevent her from aspirating. Do I know for sure whether she would have started breathing again on her own? Maybe, maybe not. But damn if I don't love that breathing monitor.	SAHMThrowaway415	t1_ddadb3g

t3_5rtopz	t1_ddafhph	1486145843	I never asked my kid's pediatrician but my friend is a neonatal nurse and recommends them. I bought the one I did after hearing another parent's experience with it. The alarm went off one night and they ran to the crib, the baby wasn't breathing. It took them almost a minute to wake her up and she started breathing again. So in this case, yes it reduced it.   It's kind of like car seats, yeah a lot of us grew up never riding in one and being just fine. Doesn't make it a stupid purchase today. You buy it hoping you never need it.	Jennrrrs	t1_ddaeg40

t3_5rtopz	t1_ddafs4v	1486146160	See here is the thing, it's pretty common knowledge that babies often stop breathing for 30-60 seconds. It's perfectly normal and they can even turn blue from it.  I feel that most of these stories are just people thinking they are "rescuing" their child because it forgot to breath for a bit (when the child would have done that on their own.)

No, we could go over what ifs all day. If you did what any REASONABLE parent would do (audio monitor + listening to doctors recommendations + swaddling) then there is nothing to beat yourself up over.  That's like getting into an accident and your daughter dying from a high speed chase and going "if only I checked the news before I left. I could have saw the chase and avoided it". Hindsight is always 20/20 and going over "what ifs" and "should haves" is pointless.  &gt;I know my mom's friend still can't talk about her baby (it happened 6 years ago).

I have seen two infants brought into the ER after their parents found them dead in the morning. One they attributed to SIDS the other was a CHF baby... the stats show it's unlikely to happen and plenty articles have been written that show these devices aren't going to save the baby's life. I'm a worrier tho and keep having to talk myself out of buying something like that.   ...mostly bc I won't trust that the POS is working correctly.

When I asked her pediatrician about it, he said she was still adjusting to the whole needing to breath thing and it was considered normal. Scared the piss out of me when I first witnessed it, I struggled to sleep for a while because I wasn't sure if she was breathing or not. I was also told that if a child is going to pass away as a result of SIDS, there's nothing that can be done to stop it; and, therefore, you shouldn't force yourself to lose sleep so you can watch them for their breathing... ):	birdpack	t1_ddafs4v

Ive looked around and saw plenty of exercise bands, that track your heart rate etc, but they all seem to be health focused, when all i really need is just some vibration on wrist when my phone is ringing...  To clarify, i dont need ANY functions apart from "phone rings -&gt; vibrate". I dont mind having them, if it means having a good quality wristband, but i just wont ever use them, so i dont want to overpay for them. Similarly i dont care about display, gps tracking, inbuilt flamethrowers or remote control drones.

t3_5scu8c	t1_ddfogvl	1486453744	Hi everyone. So I'm looking for a budget tablet that has LTE capability. As we all know, many mobile games these days require an internet connection, and while I have my phone for that, I feel more at home playing on a tablet as I usually use my phone for calling, texting and some Facebook in between. I currently own an iPad Mini 1, but it's only the Wi-Fi model and it's old let's face it. I'm looking for a budget tablet just to suit my gaming needs. iPad Mini can still be used for other things such as watching videos and reading eBooks (my "new" tablet can do the same too should I decide).  I've been looking through some tablets and am interested in the Amazon Fire 8 HD (I think that's the name), but unsure if the sim provider here in the Philippines would work on an Amazon tab as I assume it works with US carriers such as Verizon, T-Mobile, etc. I also see the Nvidia Tegra Note 7 around here which I am considering and there is an LTE ready version, but I'm still looking for other options.  The Asus Zenpad 7 is a solid choice though unfortunately when I asked my local seller, they only had 3G capability, and Zenpad 8 isn't anywhere to be found in my local stores either. I don't want to shell out a ton of money just for another iPad or other high end tablets such as Samsung. Since I'm just going to be using it primarily for gaming and even social networking (I could just use my iPad at home), any suggestions I will look into. Thank you very much!	InigoMarz	t3_5scu8c

Primarily I'd be using it to connect to a bluetooth speaker that I can use for music while at work, so it I either need to be able to download music through an app or upload my music collection to it.  I don't really need to make phone calls or text often enough to justify a monthly service fee.  If I can get something with a camera or it has a web browser or if I can install other apps on it that'd be great too.  I was thinking a tablet, but since I'd have to carry it regularly to and from my post one might be too cumbersome.

t3_5scu8c	t1_ddkrqa0	1486741432	Hi, I'm looking to get a music player for my niece.  I was hoping I could get get something that supports spotify streaming and offline play but didn't have the capability to play youtube videos or a browser.  I've looked at a 7th gen ipod nano but it looks like they might be upgrading them soon.  There was also a kickstarter for a thing called the mighty which pretty much does exactly what I was need but it could be 6 months to a year before they release for general sale.  I could get her a general mp3 player but she doesn't have any mp3s and I'm not sure if I want to teach her how to pirate music.  She does have access to spotify through a family account.  But understandable her parents don't want her to have a device that can go online to watch youtube or browse anything.  Just wondering if anyone knows of another device that could fill this niche, I was thinking I could get her an old android phone and lock it down to only play the spotify app.	FleeCircus	t3_5scu8c

t3_5tcnrf	t1_ddmjh60	1486848102	Holy effing crap. Took me a while to fully grok it, but we have a lot of tricks put together to make an impressive show, where the machines connected to the screens were an SNES and some NES's, and all the data was going through controller inputs. All of it.   The show wasn't about speed runs- it was about taking the speedrunning technology (extreme input speed and precision) and turning it into a near-arbitrary data pipe. That is a *fantastic* gadget.  * Stereo sound through two NES consoles (one for each channel) playing 7-bit PCM audio, input through controller channels  * Video streaming through the SNES with over 1Mb/s, at a weirdly effective 10fps, again, with the data transferred entirely over controller channels.   * It can change the color palette of the SNES every few frames to maintain a well-colored image, even on the live-streamed video.   fukkkkk, man. High quality hacking.  Edit: Also, skip to where they start Zelda in the video. About an hour in.	imforit	t3_5tcnrf
t3_5tcnrf	t1_ddmjjl6	1486848201	it absolutely was. and that's what they were showing off. Arbitrary high-speed data transfer over the controller channels. Amazing.	imforit	t1_ddmh1m4

t3_5tcnrf	t1_ddmmxl8	1486853395	This is pretty cool! I hope I'm understanding it right.  Are they actually using a physical SNES for this demo or are they just using an SNES emulator?  Basically, what you're telling me is: you could get a regular old Super Nintendo and The Legend of Zelda cartridge and TV. Hook your laptop up to the SNES with some cables *through the controller ports of the SNES.* Then, by having your laptop send a ton of input data through the control ports, you could program the SNES to stream arbitrary video to the TV. And they used this to stream video of Portal, Super Mario 64, and a live Skype call.	goldgibbon	t3_5tcnrf
t3_5tcnrf	t1_ddmn2kl	1486853606	Hm. That is actually pretty cool! Thanks for explaining. I remember watching it live I was pretty confused how it was working so I wasn't really blown away but it is amazing that all that works.	DOPEDupNCheckedOut	t1_ddmjjl6

t3_5tcnrf	t1_ddmsgxi	1486862034	Yes! Great write-up.      While it was happening, I didn't understand that it was a video. I was under the understanding that they had just created the game inside the game.      When they explained it, I realized how far off I was.

This is an alarming standard that seems to be simply accepted in the tech world: the thing you paid for will be forced to be deemed obsolete, too bad, consumer!  Will we all accept this so easily when our cars, our furnaces, our refrigerators are simply rendered useless in an arbitrary fashion when the manufacturer decides it's time to sell us another?  And the landfills just keep getting bigger, stuffed with perfectly serviceable machines that didn't keep a factory going somewhere.	nocturnal_goatsucker	t3_5tl1dz

t3_5tl1dz	t1_ddne227	1486911008	Well, I never had any real problems with Vista, and - if it was in fact so bad - then MS should have offered a complimentary upgrade.  But arbitrarily deciding to render something useless when you've been paid for it is a questionable business practice.    Imagine if your new house gets to the eight year mark and the builder comes back and nails all the doors shut, and says the house is no longer supported.  You have to pay him to upgrade the doors, or buy a new house.	nocturnal_goatsucker	t1_ddndxae

t3_5tl1dz	t1_ddnftna	1486914131	Its not that vista no longer works, its that it no longer recieves updates. It is also probably in that long list of terms and conditions you accepted when you used their service btw.   And your house metaphor is incorrect. Microsoft didn't build your pc. It would be more relatable if the city of residence updated their water/gas/electric lines and you didnt update your house connections. Therefore losing a service you had before but not completely losing the product you invested in.	DeathKitten666	t1_ddne227
t3_5tl1dz	t1_ddngcqj	1486915000	You don't suddenly stop being able to use your computer when they stop supporting it. Nor would you lose access to an "obsolete" refrigerator or car. And it's not arbitrary to say when they stop updating an operating system, they see when it has the fewest devices or the greatest amount of years that they are willing to pay people to develop that OS. They aren't going to pay indefinitely to update windows 95 because nobody uses it anymore, and they won't pay indefinitely to update windows vista because it was one of the least (if not THE least) popular versions of Windows NT.	ghostfacermemechaser	t1_ddne227

This already happens.  &gt;the thing you paid for will be forced to be deemed obsolete  Of course it will. That's the nature of progress. Nobody expects anyone to support a 500K hard drive, a floppy disk, or Altair anymore, do they? And more recently, nobody expects support for a first gen iPod, or a 2005 Compaq. Hardware moves on. The only reason that obsolescence is not accepted in this case for the Kindles is because a) the hardware has not progressed nearly as much as it has in other industries, b) the software should still support it just fine, and c) people would be denied access to the books they've bought.

Plenty of places in the us you pay more for heating if you use an obsolete, non conforming furnace by missing out on rebates.   You pay a premium to get parts for an obsolete car, since it's no longer supported by the manufacturer.   Those are two examples of being arbitrarily rendered useless. Just like with Vista.

It's like arguing that you don't care that a car manufacturer offers leather seats, because it's a car - it's job is to take you from A to B. The problem is not offering standard features makes the car uncompetitive, and there's no reason for a consumer shopping around to consider that car when they can buy a better featured car for the same price.	cd943t	t1_ddsme8d

t3_5u5tr5	t1_ddsqbjm	1487202910	You're right; photographers want to have the best still picture quality they can get, and many will not even touch the video options. I actually think that 4K is worse for consumers because they get gigantic files (at the risk of impared quality elsewhile) that they generally wouldn't be able to notice the difference in quality.  The reason why this is a big deal is that all the competition is offering 4K on their mid-range line of cameras. The hardware Cannon puts in these cameras is certainly capable of handling it. The only reason why they don't do it is because Cannon is trying to preserve it's differentiation between it's product lines. In other words, they're just doing it to make you spend more on their more expensive cameras.	AkirIkasu	t1_ddsjki7
t3_5u5tr5	t1_ddssbun	1487205574	Everyone above saying that it doesn't need to shoot 4K because a photographer wouldn't even video at all. But you all forget the fact that these cameras aren't made for high end photographers. They are "cheap" $700 price range cameras made for public non professional maybe even starting photographers.   My assumptions are if I'm a kid who is just about to start photographing than who knows maybe I also want to shoot some videos too to see and decide which one I prefer.   Now I know that 4K is not a standard yet, but my question is why not? We see so many tv's, monitors, even laptops that are capable of 4K, why not more cameras that can actually can shoot a nice photo AND shoot 4k60fps.	busa1	t3_5u5tr5

You see that 1.2GHz core M and scoff, but it turboboosts to like 2.5GHz which is faster than some of the i5's out there in laptops with fans. Think of the 1st number as the cruising speed and the 2nd as the faster speed capable of things like photo editing that 98% of people never do other than to crop or fix red eye.   Most other processors are like 2.2GHz with a 2.7GHz turboboost. So to be able to idle so low is really impressive because your email doesn't need a ton of power and it saves battery life.   Maybe it's not right for you but for most people it's more than enough, but there is a version with an i7.	Made_in_Murica	t1_ddt7bqe

t3_5u5tr5	t1_ddtrom4	1487266451	That situation doesn't exist with respect to adding video to digital cameras. The camera already has to do it to make live view work - they just need to capture the result to a memory card, which is a trivial issue for a large company with significant engineering resources like Canon. These models aren't way better cameras compared to the competition; in fact, in many ways they are inferior.	cd943t	t1_ddtdikb

t3_5u5tr5	t1_ddtyzjq	1487274261	I strongly disagree, since adding 4k video would force you to add a higher-speed buffer than you'd normally need for shooting photo's (though that would add to your burst speed). This makes it a tad more than trivial. And while these cameras are indeed less than what i'd expect from canon, they have done way better on various models.	incapable1337	t1_ddtrom4

Aren't there advancements in video compression tech that allow 4K to be, despite it being 4x the pixels of 1080, not 4x the file size? My experience shooting with a GH4 at least showed me that it wasn't really that big of a difference.   But yeah, Canon is a very conservative company that innovates in what they think is important to their product strategy (the EF ecosystem, dual pixel AF, low light sensitivity in the C-series cameras, build quality) and not just playing me-too! in the megapixel/resolution rat race. They're a lot like Apple in that regard, doing their own thing and most of the time the market ends up following them. Product pricing and longevity is about the same too ;)	HUSTLEMAN420	t1_ddsqbjm
t3_5u7jev	t1_ddu1beq	1487276778	&gt; until I saw M core.   Core M's can throttle up to desktop speed when needed. And when not, they are downclocked to sip power. Best of both worlds! And no more annoying fans!	HUSTLEMAN420	t1_ddt7bqe
t3_5u5tr5	t1_ddu1yo8	1487277470	You are right that a video with four times the resolution won't be four times bigger, but in order to have four times the quality, you are going to need to have more information. Think of it this way: you can have a JPEG file that is nearly perfect if you choose 90% quality, or you can have a four-times bigger JPEG that is the same filesize by reducing it to 20% quality. The 4x image will have greater resolution, but it won't show all the detail and color you could see in the 90% quality image.   Beyond that, any advancement that would help lower the filesize of a 4K video should help a 1080 video.. I can also tell you that I'm not terribly happy with Cannon's video encoding techniques (though my camera is getting quite old now).	AkirIkasu	t1_ddu0rn9

t3_5u5tr5	t1_ddu7rra	1487283923	Would a faster one really be necessary? Most recent DSLRs, these most likely included, have a 14 bit ADC. The raw video data bitrate should be around 350 megabytes a second, so Canon ought to be using some ancient DRAM if they can't handle that because most consumer stuff you can buy today is in the dozens of gigabytes per second range.

Naturally, the camera would have dedicated hardware onboard to compress the video to more manageable sizes to fit on an SD card.

t3_5v3u2v	t1_ddz27un	1487589373	My company sells the Chipolo and Tile products.  I tested out the new version of the Chipolo recently, and they have really overhauled their app, making it actually user friendly. And it is pretty loud. The upside to the Chipolo is being available in several colors (and those colors showing up in the app), but it is around the same price as the Tile Mate, which I really think is the overall more desirable device.   If they knocked $5/unit off the Chipolo, it would be a home run. But as is, they have some ground to cover before they can really gain market share. Just my opinion.	cow_goes_fert	t3_5v3u2v

t3_5v3u2v	t1_ddz447k	1487594863	Agree. I have 4 tile mates, which I replaced 4 2015 versions of the tile recently, so I stuck with them. However their app sucks, it has to be running for it to do anything. Who the f*ck keeps that app running?  One of the selling points is the crowd surfing sort of aspect of it, drop your item somewhere outside your home and mark it lost, just wait for someone else with the tile app to walk within 30 feet of it and it will alert you... but no one has that app running so that doesn't happen.  It's come in handy for my kids to find their car keys which slipped into a couch, but that's about it.	Dougth	t1_ddz34br

t3_5v3u2v	t1_ddz50u2	1487596927	I was part of the original kickstarter for chipolo as well as pebblebee, and I have both. The chipolo was fun but it's lack of noise and it's original flaky not accurate location finder eventually sent them to the bottom of my junk/tech drawer.    The pebblebee had promise but then they made the rechargeable ones really thick and kind of ruined their convienence and their app just didn't work well at all for me, very buggy at release.   Until they come out with one's that I can forget about until I need them, and the app works properly I'm not really interested in them that much.

In a small town with only two roads in and out for the city, I assume I can place two cheap phones on the choke points of the town to see if the tracker left the city. The phones would theoretically be placed in weather proof boxes with a solar panel and battery backup.   I assume there is a way to create a security network with strategic static locations of cells phones. What is the range that they can pick up the Bluetooth? May I extend the sensor range with a reflector dish? Any idea on how much a cell phone reflector dish would improve the sensor range? Is there a cheaper option than GPS Internet cell phones as the sensors?   Are these trackers able to be unified through some sort of community monitoring app that can track any brand of tracker that linked to it? Or do all of the people have to choose one brand?

t3_5v3u2v	t1_de12ub6	1487701392	Ok I read that , thanks for expanding your answer , based on what you shared it seems that the general code of conduct for electronic media is based on these pillars : public trust, truthfulness, fairness, integrity, independence and accountability. Granted those are a lot of subjective pillars and as I mentioned in my original comment , if you are offended by that joke in the tech review you can simply write to the Verge or the relevant ombudsman and air your grievance.    To my specific opinion , based on your code of conduct comment  and the aforementioned pillars,   The article does not erode my public trust in the publication .  Mr Trumps behaviour backstage at beauty pageants is well documented  , so there is some truth to this characterization .  Is it fair to make fun of a sitting president? Eh probably not I will give you that, however I am biased here , Mr Trump has treated all media as the enemy and is disdainful of critical and fair questions ... and every person in the public spotlight , fair or unfair ,gets some ribbing . Also if you don't want stupid jokes made about you , don't do stupid shit  There many nuances to this so this is a longer discussion for another time.  Is the integrity of the Verge compromised by allowing a light bit of political jocularity in an article ? Not for me , I still trust them to write about tech and culture.  Independence? America  Accountability ? Ombudsman.  You have the power to affect all you hear and see and the freedom to be who you are and say what you want to say ,as long as those words and actions do not infringe upon the rights of others.  And as my Aussie friend once told me , the golden rule of society is: Don't be a dick.  ( unless of course you are, in fact , a dick,  in which case, wow )   TLDR: Yes , I have heard of journalistic integrity.	AfriQ	t3_5v3u2v

I'm returning it for her tho, because the 77D is the same price (899) so might as well upgrade to that for free.  That... that's not how 'Free' works.  All that means is you spent $900 you could have spent elsewhere.   Counter point to your $900 choice:  http://imgur.com/K0DP8XP  The photo, seen above was taken on a $150 Canon T1i.   Really, I use it as a full time camera. The person in that picture has an A7RII, Is the A7R better in every way possible? sure! (Well, except I carry one battery and he carries 10)  Is the A7RII 20 times better at 20 times the price? No. In most cases I feel the best it can do (at Web resolutions) is 1.5. Sure it's better in a lot of ways, but for that kind of use, it's not worth it.   Also....  You do know that the 70D is the prosumer standard of video... right?

t3_5v3u2v	t1_de16cb7	1487705137	I was part of this original campaign and I have to say, I was pretty disappointed in the first gen Chipolo. They had all sorts of problems and I don't remember the details exactly but I had to send mine back to Slovenia to exchange it due to some sort of defect affecting all the units. The battery life was abysmal and was eating CR2032 cells like crazy. When you want to change the battery (which aren't cheap), you had to pry open the snap closure, held together by tabs. After the third battery change, my (which are 1/2mm tall), broke and now the thing is no longer usable.  The whole thing just left a bad taste in my mouth. But, that was years ago.

Advantages? None! Gimmick factor? Off the fucking charts. Possibility? Slim to none.   In reality they're squeezing out an iPhone 7s.

However, there is a primary coastal road that runs through the three primary cities. I can picture an inexpensive, highly effective public security system that is entirely voluntary. With little to no recurring costs.   I am surprised this strategy has not been pitched by one of these chip trackers to a municipality yet.

t3_5vhf0w	t1_de2udj1	1487792456	They were slow as fuck due to the fact they often depended on third party drivers. No phone manufacturer had any interest in prodding that technology with their expensive R&amp;D sticks until Apple came along and integrated one of the most seamless fingerprint sensors any consumer device had ever seen.

I'm more shocked tbh about the Samsung S8+ costing upwards of 1k than I am this iphone costing 1k. At least with Samsung we know that within 6 months of release, you will be able to obtain the phone for a big discount.

t3_5x3cze	t1_def4rdi	1488475090	What a revelation. Single core is still the major factor in the majority of games performance.  Multiple cores (4+ including virtual) WILL become much more industry wide in the not so distance future, though. Battlefield 1 is a prime example.

I think an 8-core is simply not economical for gamers, just like how no gamer should be buying an 8-core Intel chip either.  8-core chips are for workstations, even more so when your quad core model has hyperthreading anyways.	catwhiches	t3_5x3cze
t3_5x3cze	t1_defkg6f	1488491720	Developer here.  There's no "getting used to dx12/vulkan".  Nor is there a magic bullet.  Multi-threading has been around for more than a decade.  It's simply not worth your "fantasy super optimizations" 99.99% of the time for the target demo.  There is no profit to be made in wasting years of man power for a sub 1-5% increase in performance.  Doubly when the most powerful adopted home console is in the hands of users who barely care about 60fps gaming.  Pretty still trumps frame rate says the market research.  Would anyone have bought Horizon: Zero Dawn if it had half the visual fidelity?  It's a rather generic title outside it's looks, albeit polished extremely well.  I love Ryzen and the multi-core concept, there's simply nothing consumer grade driving what you're expecting.  Amazing things in STEM of course, but gaming is entertainment and will always be treated as such.  In fact, the only thing I can think of to create that force is mass adoption of super low powered multi-core systems with 12-24+ cores.  Then maybe the types of 1:1 scaling optimization you're dreaming about will start to surface.  The average consumer has been touting these multi-core fantasies en masse since the PS3 release.  The architecture was a nightmare compared to faster single-threaded systems.  It'll happen, but not for another decade minimum.  Mind you; That's only IF we hit a physical limit on single threaded throughput.  There may be a new breakthrough by then.  Now, to develop ON?  It's fucking fantastic.	RyzenFanboy	t1_defa00m

t3_5x3cze	t1_defm0s7	1488493451	So the scaling we see isn't much simpler to achieve with vulkan? At least when I compare Talos GL vs Vulkan I see my cores utilized more evenly and with a higher and more stable framerate.	rosts	t1_defkg6f

t3_5x3cze	t1_defu06y	1488503128	You're talking about several different things here.  There are some new automatic features, the entire point of Vulkan really, but they don't necessarily scale better than previous manual methods.  Vulkan would make it easier for more developers to use up to date multi-threading methodologies en masse, but would not necessarily push the scaling to the point you'd expect yet.  So you'll see more optimized applications in the wild, which will make it appear that scaling is getting better, but the reality is simply that more people are using better implementations automatically.  The implementations themselves are not scaling in power as you'd think 1:1 yet.  At least not on general purpose CPUs.  GPU's are a whole different story.  I hope that made some sense.  I've been drinking.  Vulkan will come and go, as did the previous implementation and so on.  There's no magic multi-thread breakthrough yet.  I'd imagine you'd have to change CPU design entirely, but that's not my department.	RyzenFanboy	t1_defm0s7

If Ryzen 3 and 5 beat the competition for gaming at their price points for gaming that will be just as headline-worthy as this is right now.

To you point about merging Xiaomi and Huawei to maximize manufacturing potential, they both outsource most of their manufacturing to contract manufacturers like foxconn - so that might serve the same purpose.	blueberrywalrus	t1_degtypw
t3_5x3cze	t1_dem5xin	1488890304	Yes, without Vulkan or similar, any multi-threading is manually programmed.  When using Vulkan or other multitasking APIs you can classify what goes where, how important it is, access to different queues, how things spread between available cores.  When bare coding, it's single threaded.  The behavior however.. is that the OS will use other cores while a single threaded game uses core 0, etc.  So the OS does to some extent offset itself, but it doesn't touch the app.  Hope that helps.

It is really annoying that all good keyboard makers only ever make keyboards with long-travel keys.

The "CIA" is not "America."    **If you can be attacked with the truth about what you are doing to your own people, then you deserve to be attacked.**   Information is not violence. Truth is not coercion. It is the light. It is time that America became more like Athens and less like Sparta.

ROFLMAO - Who is the one spouting conspiracy theories here? I don't know what the hell is up with Wikileaks. All I know is that they release stuff that is interesting and reveals problems with governance.   &gt;So if this were WW2, you would be sending "thank you cards" to the Third Reich for spying on your government and cherry-picking bad things about it in propaganda, so long as they were true?  This isn't World War 2, blockhead. Hysterically ranting as if this were World War 2, acting as if we should be or are at war with Russia only makes you look worse. Do you want World War III?    Since, however, you're committed to hysterical comparisons, let's roll with it baby. Allow me to be clear: **If the Devil himself were to offer legitimate proof of injustice in Heaven, then God would be well-served by knowing what the angels and seraphim were up to.**  &gt;Yes, Vladimir Putin's victims all have it coming. Freedom is just a decadent Western conceit that he is heroically saving us from.  Poor victim CIA? What in the actual...? No, we are the victims. This government, which is supposed to be BY, OF, and FOR the people is NOT the victim.   &gt;And you know this because they say so.  No, I know this because Wikileaks is not historically attacked for getting it wrong. The "victims" of Wikileaks don't deny the leaks!

t3_5z285a	t1_deuu19n	1489374777	It does appear to be supported in my Galaxy S6 from 2015 (and S4 and S5 from 2013/2014) and people upgrade phones pretty frequently. I am due for an upgrade roughly around when the S8 launches. I know flagships tend to sell in higher volume than feature phones.   It is a Qualcomm standard and they keep a list of supported devices and [phones](https://www.aptx.com/products?field_product_category_tid=126)   Samsung Galaxy, LG G3/G4/G5, HTC M9/10, Sony Xperia, Nokia Lumia, and ASUS ZenFone are all on the list.  The downside is it has to be supported by the bluetooth device as well and some of those get replaced less frequently than phones.	BICEP2	t1_deutihe
t3_5z285a	t1_deuujmb	1489375574	You have crappy bitrates, codecs that have to be supported on both devices, interference, software issues etc.  My favorite bluetooth problem is sometimes I'll be paired with my car and it will crap out while. Sometimes it's fixed by repairing bluetooth but once in a while it simply will not pair again unless I pull off the side of the road to reboot...my car.  It's hard to fathom that I'm actually pulling over to the shoulder to reboot my car to resolve a bluetooth bug but it happens.   I get that the 3.5mm jack and standard isn't perfect and could use some improvement but I would rather see another hardware spec to replace it than just have wireless be the only other option.   It's a lot like WiFi vs ethernet. WiFi has improved tons but I still prefer to cable the stuff that can be cabled.	BICEP2	t1_deutpmo

t3_5yn0xo	t1_dev4gb8	1489398857	Yeah... I actually switched my display resolution to 1440p to give it a little more stamina.

t3_5yn0xo	t1_devkudv	1489425494	Well, the battery is dead (will run with power cord attached and new ones are quite cheap), the metal cover came off on one side (could be glued i guess), the display has a horizontal line of dead pixels (not sure how or when that happened) and the trackpad broke. To be fair, it was in heavy use for roughly 4 years, sometimes running days at a time. I actually booted it up a few weeks ago. Fingerprint reader worked on first try. Booting up windows took ages, the OS on that machine is a mess... Everything else worked quite well. Did not do any thorough testing though, the broken display is just so annoying.	tell_me_why_you_suck	t1_deve4mz
