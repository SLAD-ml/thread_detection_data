# thread_detection_data

The data for EMNLP 2019 paper "Context-Aware Conversation Thread Detection in Multi-Party Chat", generated from Reddit data. 

The format:
<thread-id>	<msg-id>	<timestamp>	<text>	<username> <parent-msg-id>

We follow the setup in the NAACL paper 2018 "Learning to Disentangle Interleaved Conversational Threads with a Siamese Hierarchical Network and Similarity Ranking
" and didn't use parent-msg-id.
