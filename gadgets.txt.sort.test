As the name of the new system implies, visuals will be displayed in 2D only. The system is lighter but still packs the same power as New Nintendo 3DS XL, and has built-in NFC support for amiibo cards and figures. It can play the massive library of quality Nintendo 3DS, New Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo DS games in 2D. Nintendo systems are also the only dedicated video game systems where people can find their favorite characters and game franchises, such as Mario, Peach, Yoshi, Kirby, Pokémon, Fire Emblem, Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros., Animal Crossing and The Legend of Zelda.

t3_68mokv	t1_dh0qg2t	1493705682	I'm convinced 2.3 million didn't get a NES classic, since there seem to be thousands of scalpers that have bought and sold them and even now, that have their own stock of them, waiting for the price to get going up.

t3_68mokv	t1_dh0vdsf	1493720285	I could easily put together a complete emulation package on my own with a Pi -- I'm lazy, and between work, and home projects, sometimes it's worth paying a few bucks to just open the box, plug it in, and enjoy some instant nostalgia.   I wanted one, I would have happily paid MSRP for it too, but Nintendo decided they don't want to cash in on the huge player base of 30-ish year old's who wanted to get in on this. Cut production right as it's selling out everywhere?  What kind of dick move is that?  This was the first piece of hardware since the N64 I was truly excited about (from nintendo) and they pull the carpet right out from under it.   Fuck em' then, not only do they not have my money, they've pissed me off.   One theory on their behavior is they pulled production at the height of its popularity so when they come out with the next version of "Classic NES" it will be more expensive, harder to hack, etc etc and people will line up around the block (not me - they had their shot and blew it)	MrNerd82	t3_68mokv

t3_68kke8	t1_dh3h7iz	1493850768	It's a nonexistent market. Any speaker requires power, because a 3.5mm audio source just doesn't put out enough power to drive anything bigger than a pair of headphones. Therefore any portable speaker needs a power supply, which will inevitably be a battery, and so it's not a stretch to just add Bluetooth functionality to it to make it fully wireless. I guess you could buy a stereo computer speaker set for your laptop and power it off 5v, but that won't fill a room as well as any half-decent bluetooth speaker would.  There was a short time when portable devices didn't have bluetooth, and some docks/external speakers with batteries and aux inputs came out, but any of those will be out or production, total shit, or both.  Most of the good, non-waterproof portable speakers feature an Aux input. I'd just buy a JBL or Logitech with your size/weight/power requirements and a lead to match it if I were you. If you really want to stretch the size and you can get AC power to it, a small TV soundbar might do the trick.	LatinGeek	t1_dh1qa3o

I'm not shilling for the websites and I'm not saying people *shouldn't* ask reddit about this stuff, but I feel like a lot of the simpler, overarching questions like "What's the best set of headphones for $100?" or "What kind of laptop do I need for X usage?" are answered quicker *and better* by their readymade lists and articles, and that would give the more specific/esoteric questions that benefit from people's input more exposure.

Search for a convertible.  They come with windows, which is possibly more useful than chromeos, and can be had for $300 or so in a 10" size or $500 in a 13"   My current one is a 10" I got for $200.      They can also be found at the five and dime stores irl.    Pretty much just a fatter lower spec surface from whatever your favorite brand is at a  lower price point.   Performance will be on par mostly with a cheap  5 year old laptop, and the battery life should be 6 hours or more.   vs a cheap old pavillion you'll get more battery, similar performance, and better portability.	gsasquatch	t1_dh4i55e

I'm surprised it took that long. Bret Victor explained it best:  *I call this technology Pictures Under Glass. Pictures Under Glass sacrifice all the tactile richness of working with our hands, offering instead a hokey visual facade. Is that so bad, to dump the tactile for the visual?*  *Try this: close your eyes and tie your shoelaces. No problem at all, right? Now, how well do you think you could tie your shoes if your arm was asleep? Or even if your fingers were numb? When working with our hands, touch does the driving, and vision helps out from the back seat.*  *Pictures Under Glass is an interaction paradigm of permanent numbness. It's a Novocaine drip to the wrist. It denies our hands what they do best. And yet, it's the star player in every Vision Of The Future.*  http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/  I really hope this is the start of a trend	joepierson	t3_697dae

PCs have dozens of popular languages and IDEs to suit any need.   Personally I think [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) is the very best way to get someone started with coding. Python is a fantastic language that's both easy to pick up and popular in real-world applications. The course focuses on what programming is (syntax) how programmers think (algorithms) AND real-world usage. It's very complete in that regard.   If you can catch [the free Coursera MOOC,](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) I'd recommend it too. Dr. Chuck is very engaging, it really feels like a college course.

If you have a mechanical keyboard with clicky switches like blue, brown, black, etc. you're going to pick up your keystrokes regardless.

I mean, that's how the Romans managed to develop so much. They kept conquering in order to drive progress.  Nukes are a scary prospect, though. However, in the 70+ years we've had them, we only used them in warfare twice (also, we're trying to decrease our arsenal constantly). Humans only fight each other and destroy under the prospect of a better world for the winning party. We recognize that using nukes on each other would only end up with the destruction of mankind, no winners there. That's why they're more useful as a deturent than as a weapon.   If we were more destructive and inept than we are constructive and creative, we certainly wouldn't be where we are today.	henzry	t1_dhedgwe

t3_6adxqv	t1_dhep7op	1494476707	I mean look at Europe. Name one region of the world that had more infighting, shifting boarders, and changing alliances over the course of human history. Despite this, they managed to conquer most of the known world.   Even though the Chinese invented gunpowder, it was Europe that really made use of it. China may have had many instances of infighting throughout history, but they stayed relatively united compared to Europe. Europe turned out so much art, technology, and scientific advancements in the Renaissance as a result of try to finding new ways to kill each other.  I'm not saying we should actively seek out war to improve ourselves. That imperialistic mindset is what started WW1 and 2. I think trade is far more important. Gunpowder and cannons changed the way wars were fought by effectively making castles obsolete as a means of defending your kingdom. This meant you had to maintain a large army instead, but that requires a lot of money. European nations began trading with each other to build these armies and as a result, tech, knowledge, and art began to spread and flourish again, marking the beginning of the renaissance.  Warfare isn't necessary, but it can play a role in starting something bigger.	henzry	t1_dhenwn5

t3_6adxqv	t1_dheqxkr	1494479738	Ya. One of the reasons Europe expanded to conquer was because a lack of natural resources. So when we don't have anywhere to go, we're gonna have to figure some shit out.  However, humans have a tendency to underestimate how much we have yet to achieve. In 1900, renowned physicist Lord Kelvin said "There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement". He said that 5 years before Einstein displayed his theory of relativity, turning modern physics on it's head.  What I'm trying say is: We may be shortsighted, but we're pretty smart fuckers.

Some products are compatible with a specific hub and some of these hubs are cross compatible with other hubs as well so you can have sort of a mini network that connects to the larger network.  It can get pretty complicated.  There are lots of factors involved as well. Since my home is a little older I had to go with the Lutron Caseta system for lighting due to the switches working without a neutral wire.  I'm no electrician so I wasn't about to run my own neutral wires. For now I'm just running the lights on the Caseta Smart Bridge.  In the future I may connect this to a SmartThings or other hub when I decide to add more components.

t3_6b1jks	t1_dhj2ssl	1494728752	As long as they keep updating something with roughly the form factor of the iPhone 5/5S/SE then I don't really care what else they release.  But I doubt they'll skip over the 7S, and releasing two new series at once doesn't really seem Apple's style. Especially if the iPhone 8 won't be shipping until 2018:  &gt;Obviously, everyone is excited at the idea of a brand new, redesigned iPhone. But it’s not yet clear that Apple will launch one. Analysts at KGI and Deutsche Bank have both published notes saying that iPhone 8 may not be ready to launch this year. That sets up the possibility that CEO Tim Cook might “unveil” iPhone 8 at the September event, but then only release it for sale sometime in 2018. That’s what happened with Apple Watch, which was announced in September 2014 but only went on sale in April 2015  Here's a thought, maybe the iPhone 8 that won't be ready to ship until 2018 is, you know, **that year's model**, and they'll release the 7S this fall, like they've done literally every time since the 3G.

t3_6b1jks	t1_dhj7q2m	1494737178	Considering the S8+ costs $824.99, I don't think $1000 for the iPhone 8+ is totally out of the question.  That said, this article is completely speculative nonsense based on nothing but guesses about what the rumoured hardware would cost.

t3_69wkwd	t1_dhj7u32	1494737390	I have no idea where to go for that kind of discussion, but as someone who sells Cordless/DECT phones I would recommend Panasonic over all others I've dealt with, at least for consumer-level use. I find their build quality and features to be very good, and best of all they use normal AAA NiMH batteries instead of some proprietary battery back, so when the batteries (inevitably) wear out, you can replace them easily and cheaply.  As with anything though, it really depends on what you're looking for and what features you want.	Kerrigore	t1_dhi716m

t3_69wkwd	t1_dhj87xp	1494738124	If you're going pre-built/name brand I would go with Asus or MSI, they both tend to build fairly solid machines. My person preference is Asus because they tend to go heavier duty on the cooling, which makes their laptops heavier/bulkier, but keeps the system running cooler. And if any laptop gets too hot, it will throttle the CPU/GPU to compensate, which will negatively impact performance once you reach that point.  I personally would not recommend going smaller than 15.6" for a gaming laptop. For gaming you're likely going to want a quad-core i7 and a decent GPU (e.g. GTX 1060), and trying to fit that into a 14" screen is both expensive and likely to lead to sub-optimal results due to heat issues. 15.6" machines are also more likely to be able to accommodate extra features like dual storage (HDD + SSD, or dual SSD) and 4 RAM slots, though often those are only available if you go to 17.3". Asus doesn't even make a gaming laptop that small as far as I know, although MSI does (but I've seen tons of MSI models with heat issues due to being too thin/light).   If you want to see some examples, check [here](https://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;N=100167732%204814%20600553908%2050001315%204022%204023%204084%20601205664&amp;cm_sp=CAT_Gaming-Laptops_2-_-VisNav-_-15.6-Inch).

t3_69wkwd	t1_dhj8kwk	1494738861	Asus Zenbooks are great in my experience (which is 8 years of selling computers). Great machine for that kind of usage.  My one warning would be that 1920 x 1080 can, for some people, be too high a resolution on a 13.3" screen. You should try and see a laptop with that size/resolution in person before ordering it to make sure you'll be comfortable. Although it might seem counter-intuitive, sometimes a bit lower resolution is better when it comes to smaller screened Windows laptops, because Windows scaling is still pretty lackluster in my opinion, and is not implemented consistently in all software. I know at least one of my friends who bought a similar machine to that, and ended up having to fiddle around a ton with extra software trying to get the screen to his liking, and never really got anything that worked perfectly for him.  Personally I find 1440 x 900 on my 12" laptop to be at the edge of what I'd be able to be comfortable with, and that's 140ppi. A 1920 x 1080 13.3" is 165ppi.	Kerrigore	t1_dhbuizw

t3_69wkwd	t1_dhjeky2	1494755823	Thanks!  I have a slightly more specific question, though it might be a stretch.  I actually bought Siemens (N300A IP base + S685 IP handsets) some years ago.  I had favoured Panasonic, but reviews suggested Siemens were more robust, which tipped the scales for my needs at the time (children!)  The Siemens kit works mostly OK, but when I recently bought a Sennheiser Headset (HS 4.40BT), I was disappointed that it does not work with the S685 IP bluetooth - they seem to "pair" OK, but there is no sound.   I was hoping to find someone who could recommend a DECT handset that would work with both the Siemens N300A IP base station *and* the HS 4.40BT headset.  I assume it would be one of the Siemens handsets, but since my current handsets already *claim* they do bluetooth, I'm unsure of the actual capabilities of newer handsets.   I guess they're more likely to be compatible with newer bluetooth standards, but details are lacking in the literature I've been able to find so far.  From the Sennheiser HD 4.40BT manual: "The headphones comply with the Bluetooth 4.0 standard, and are compatible with all Bluetooth 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0 and 4.0 devices with the following Bluetooth profiles: HFP (Hands-Free Profile), HSP (Headset Profile), AVRCP (Advanced Video Remote Control Profile) and A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile)."  Makes me wonder why the S685 IP will not work, but I will be happy to get an additional handset to get this working.  Sorry there are so many words in this post.  Do you have any advice for me?

t3_6b1jks	t1_dhjnru6	1494775805	For what 99% of people want to do with their smartphone, there are no "limitations" on the iPhone. Yes, I am aware there are things Apple won't let you do, but most people not only don't want to do those things, but wouldn't even understand what they are if you explained it to them. This is evidenced by how few people jailbreak their iOS devices compared to a few years back.  The amount of users that actually care about being able to root their phone or run a torrent client on it or whatever is insignificant, and no phone manufacturer cares about them in the slightest.

t3_6b1jks	t1_dhjq3sl	1494779130	&gt;Having more than the prescribed amount of storage in a phone is the biggest issue I still see with pretty much every Apple product but I totally get you there.   As long as you get more than the basic storage it's usually a non-issue for most people. Even the base 32GB is not bad for most people now, and you can get as much as 256GB if you need it. The idea of adding more via MicroSD is nice but I don't like how Android actually implements it. I find it very annoying having to actively manage the storage between the built in and the extra storage, and a lot of versions of Android put limitations in how you can use it (often for good reason, but can be confusing for average users). It would be nice if they implemented a feature to just have the OS manage the storage seamlessly, but I guess it would create problems if anyone ever removed their MicroSD card since they wouldn't know what was located on it.  &gt;Still sad to see people buying these things when  a $200 Nokia will do literally exactly what they want.   Yes and no. Some people want a top notch camera or screen, which you're not going to get in a $200 phone. A lot of people *do* buy low end (100-250) or midrange (250-500) phones, it's the majority of the market in my experience.

My friend had a Sony Xperia (not sure what model, but this was about two years ago) which could not run any DS or GBA emulators without crashing on the Play Store and from the internet.

t3_69wkwd	t1_dhk2pph	1494795703	While I cannot say I have ever looked at this, I would say based on behind the scenes stuff from TV that battery packs of varying sizes are used for wildlife photography. As for your first point, are u planning on putting a permanent outdoors camera on your house/property? In which case I would ask an electrician to do it, it seems to me that they would be connected to power in the same way as lights. If you have a Sonos music system, they connect to the wireless network automatically without a password needed when they are connected to power, so maybe this technique is employed. Just to reiterate, I have no experience whatsoever and I think a search would be in order here, but hope I have lead you in the right direction.	TheKey123	t1_dhhn75x
t3_69wkwd	t1_dhk30ym	1494796091	Hey so I looked up the phone and found that it has some fairly good all round reviews. However, there seems to be a problem with screen rotation on it (perhaps not the best for emulating) and its screen is tiny and poor quality. If you have had a similar phone before and you were happy then by all means I would recommend it, it seems a sound phone with not much real negative points other than ode mentioned above.  (Edit: I forgot to mention that its storage is also very small, although I'm not sure how small. Depends how many games and save files you're gonna have)	TheKey123	t3_69wkwd

I've used all of these phones and then some. The only product I would put below an Apple is a Blackberry. If you like Apple products, good for you that's fine. But in no way are they top in any part of the industry. Just look at the market share friend. When compared against any equivalent competition in any sector, they do not perform.  From my personal experience with an Apple, tech stuff aside, I just didn't like any part of them. Dropped calls like crazy and random pocket dials.

My understanding was that this company has actually shipped product in the past for a Kickstarter campaign but the only evidence I have seen of people receiving Here One is on social media controlled by the company.  (Before you judge me for buying a $300 earbud with a two hour battery life, I'm a physician and more interested in potentially using it in hospital for temporary hearing aids for hearing impaired patients, which make up a significant part of my practice.

t3_6bgfyw	t1_dhngyp9	1494977466	You see the problem is. I define a solution that powers my audio device and plays my music simultaneously with the same source to be a feature of the headphone jack. This feature is not and can not be replicated as providing power and sound is a feature of analog.  Outside of analog you can attempt to replicate this by using a analog to digital to prepare audio for transmission and convert it back at the headphone from digital to analog. Then have a separate connection to the phone to provide power. Those two connections can be inside the same cable  I have no reason to add additional steps in between my phone's data and my earphones.  This is an unavoidable cost if you want to have wireless earphones . However since I do not want wireless earphones  it makes it nothing more than obsolescence for the sake of obsolescence which is foolish.

t3_6bqosu	t1_dhps74n	1495104438	I used to have an FX-8350 (8 cores), and loved it.  When Ryzen first dropped I was looking at getting one, but then I started really looking into my use profile to see how many cores I was actually using on a regular basis.  I was trying to decide if it made sense to go with 8 cores/16 threads or if 6 cores/12 threads made more sense.  And what I came up with is that for the overwhelming majority of my use cases I was rarely using more than 3, sometimes 4 cores.  So then I decided to focus more on getting a quad-core with the highest per-core performance, and settled on a i7-7700k from Microcenter for $299.  Having 4 true cores and 8 threads turned out to be more than enough for me.  My old FX-8350 is now running my "home lab" that used to be spread across multiple physical boxes.  It's all VMs at this point, and is more than enough to do the job.  So while Threadripper sounds awesome, the number of use cases for something with so many cores threads are going to be pretty limited.  If you're doing rendering, high-density virtualization (on a desktop???) or something similar then you may benefit from it.  For most people they would be better off with something else.	notwhoithink	t1_dhpl5z7

t3_6bqosu	t1_dhq3tgb	1495121402	This continued development of AMD tech is great news for us content creators, video editors; people who work in c4d using the physical render, maya, audio engineers, etc...Intel was strangling us with the pricepoint noose.  AMD came in and pretty much halved the amount of money we would have to spend to buy the same processing power.   This, and that the excellent reliability/stability of the zen product will no doubt be carried over similarly within Threadripper, is really exciting.  I am so impressed with AMD right now.  They are really on top of their game.  I am writing this on a system using the 1800x @ 4ghz and it has been completely reliable and stable under heavy render loads lasting up to about 20hrs of 100% utilization on all 8cores/16threads ... with really nice temps!  However, I regret my timing choice in purchasing Zen now, since I *just* built a Ryzen 1800x setup a few weeks back; thinking I was purchasing into the higher end of AMD-only to have been immediately outclassed.  I am not in any way suggesting I would prefer a reduction in the speed of technology advancement; but that it would have been nice to have had this tech available with the launch of Zen so that buyers could know their options.  Had I known within a month of my build; that another core-doubling processor family would be released; I would have seriously just waited.         But all in all; I have to say; I am excited to see what the future brings in the ongoing war between AMD and Intel.  Intel might have something up their sleeve.  Who knows.	SBVO	t3_6bqosu

t3_6bpf2l	t1_dhqpvns	1495144804	As a hardcore Windows and Android fanboy up until a few years ago, Apple is pretty cool honestly. It started with me getting a Chromebook because I needed a lightweight laptop to do some notetaking in class that's faster than pen &amp; paper and also more efficient than a phone. Then I realized I want to use my laptop for some more stuff and around this time Windows 10 came out and I'm just not a fan at all of the direction Microsoft has taken. So I got myself a Macbook Pro and wow. It just works. No fiddling with configuration files, changing things in the registry or %appdata% folders in Windows or whatever, but equally as powerful of a system. Around this time I also switched to iPhone because I was tired of how buggy, laggy and unoptomized Android was. So now I have a Windows 7 desktop PC, Macbook Pro and an iPhone. Feels amazing honestly. I just wish Itunes on Windows was much better.	alabrand	t1_dhq5pc2

Before you hop over there and ask in our [daily purchase help thread](/r/audiophile/about/sticky), allow me to clarify a few things:  "Earbuds" only sit in the [concha](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b6/1e/2e/b61e2eb4b075b4c04966135e112753ce.jpg) of the outer ear, and only lightly pointing in to your ear canal.  These do not form a seal from the world, and are more or less designed to allow outside sounds in.  Examples of earbuds are the Airpods/Earpods from Apple.  The other type of headphone that sits in your ear is an "in-ear monitor", which are either custom molded, or use foam or silicone tips.  These sit in your ear canal, forming an airtight seal.  Such headphones, given the right fit of tips can provide isolation from the surrounding world that is superior to what is achievable with active noise cancelling.  While there certainly are IEMs with noise cancelling, the noise cancelling is generally not necessary, and it can have adverse effects on sound quality - to the point that some people find use of such technology uncomfortable - not to forget it requires that you have batteries (or use a digital connection technology like Lightning, USB-C or Bluetooth (which is a special case of "battery".  You should absolutely also set yourself a budget: As you'll note in the wizard I proposed, things can get very expensive very quick.  If you've never experienced high-quality sound before, I would suggest investing about $100, and going for a headphone with a neutral sound signature.	Arve	t1_dhrw0k6

It let's the video player know which parts of the file are video, which are audio, and which are subtitles. It also tells the video player at the beginning the audio bitrate and depth and what codecs they are in. MKV and MP4 both support X264 video and AAC audio so if you wanted to change an MKV file to MP4 without compressing it you could do that quickly.

t3_6cojma	t1_dhw674f	1495473448	Why did it need an app?   What will the app do? What can an on-demand water heater with an app do that an on-demand water heater can't?   Like, does it tell you the temperature on the app because I can do the same thing by turning the faucet on and holding my hand under it.   "It's hot."  &gt;The Heatworks app will let you monitor the amount of hot water and energy used on a given day, keep tabs on your favorite shower temperatures, and more.

If the lady had this app and cranked the heater up so that she could melt her skin off and didn't think to change it back I would go in and put it halfway red and nearly kill myself.

t3_6cojma	t1_dhwnias	1495493925	So electric tankless water heaters just don't work very well.  I have one, and the only way to get it to work is to have my old 40 gallon heat the water to 90 then run it into the tankless that pushes it to 120.  I hope this saves me energy, but I kind of doubt it.  On top of it not working very well it takes 6 50amp circits and pumps a shit tonne of power when in use.	LostAbbott	t3_6cojma
t3_6clrgj	t1_dhwoice	1495495255	You sure the voltage is 64 or the wattage? The Mac usb-c charger should output at different voltage levels, including 5V at 2.4 A which will work on the Nexus 5X.  The phone will draw the current it needs and the charger won't work as hard.

My water heating bill with usage of one daily shower, 5 baths a week, load of dishes every two days, laundry every two days...  Is $12 because when the electric company came around convincing everyone to install smart bill reducing heaters, I said no way in hell I'll keep the gas heater.

t3_6cvus7	t1_dhxzkgc	1495567710	Getting precise measurements of changes happening in your body is time consuming and rarely accurate. Especially if you're just tracking weight. If you're spending a good amount of time at the gym it makes sense to track what's happening with all of your body. This scale solves that problem. Also, this is definitely better than taking taking selfies every day and posting on Instagram.	markr4200	t3_6cvus7
t3_6cvus7	t1_dhy015r	1495568219	Exactly, I think short term it will be great for tailors etc to get one of these. I'm thinking that a chain like SuitSupply is perfect since they have a younger target group.

This device is aimed at lawyers, researchers, and other professionals who carry a lot of reading materials. It doesn't compete with tablets or laptops, the value proposition here is not having to lug around kilograms of printed materials.  Also worth pointing out that large format e-ink panels are just very very expensive at the moment. If they could have priced it cheaper, they certainly would have because such a high price locks out other markets, such as people like you.	BicubicSquared	t1_di0lir1

t3_6cvs4b	t1_di1835l	1495733009	I ultimately went with the Pro + Pencil.  I have a Cintiq 13HD as well and the Pencil performs as well or better (along screen edges).  Subjectively I also have always enjoyed iOS and iPad in general, but it's tough to beat the objective benefits of an iPad including extremely light weight and small footprint, excellent battery life, and almost non-existent parallax.  Wacom's mobile studio is a beast, but it is large, heavy and won't last more than a couple hours.  As a portable digital sketchbook iPad is pretty much best in class IMO.  iPad's screen is also much nicer than my 13HD.  Only downside is you can't use desktop class graphics software.	bicameral_mind	t1_di0ni79

If you have a dead set hard limit of $50 maybe get the headphones and get the pads after you save a few extra bucks. But the upgrade in pads is definitely worth it. I have quite a few sets of headphones and this is the best I have for that price point.

It might also allow interesting data on the efficacy of various workout routines (or dietary decisions) on altering your body.   But to the average person it would be useless.	ConciselyVerbose	t1_dhxr76g
t3_6cojma	t1_di6v399	1496076655	Uh...what? Ignorance + attitude is uncool.  So, 'running hot water' is just running cool water that has been heated by a device prior to dispensing. We call those devices 'water heaters.'  The older variants had a big tank of water they kept heated. Turns out keeping a big tank of water hot 24/7 is inefficient.  These 'tankless' variants have no tank. Instead they heat water on demand.	wantsemall	t1_di5aitg
t3_6cvus7	t1_di701o5	1496083037	World-and-national-class athletes use backscatter body composition scanners that can tell you everything - bone density, fat, water, muscle composition. But it's mostly diagnostic, not performance-indicating. Said athletes are also regularly getting diagnostic blood and urine tests.  Professional and nationally-competitive-amateur athletes may use the same, or air chamber measurement devices, or water displacement tank measurement....but it's probably still more of a curiosity thing than anything else.  There is no application here to evaluating workout performance - you measure actual performance, using metabolic gas analyzers (to determine things like VO2max, resting metabolism, etc), ergometers and power meters to determine work output over time, and tracking strength by max / x-repetitions with Y weight.  99.9% of people who consider themselves athletes can have their needs met by regularly using a scale which estimates body composition - not the individual readings, because they're pretty useless there - but instead looking at trends over months or more, with the data heavily averaged. Even then, it's mostly useless except for tracking progress if you're overweight or underweight.  Serious athletes tend to have issues with going underweight from not getting enough calories, and looking at body fat and weight trends - again, over weeks or months - can help.	alltheacro	t1_di6rtd7
t3_6cvus7	t1_di70lav	1496083751	The scanner can't tell the difference between fat and muscle, so no.  Also: neither a mirror nor a scanner will tell you about imbalances and such. Working with a trainer to start, and educating yourself over time, is the answer.	alltheacro	t1_dhxttqz

t3_6dyvar	t1_di754fs	1496089700	Bit of an unorthodox question, but I'm looking for a portable device that can play audio cassette tapes (like a walkman) and can also record onto the tapes with standard 3.5mm audio input. I know there are some excellent classic devices that can do this (the Sony WM-D6C being the best example), but these are super expensive and hard to come by unfortunately. Is there a device that can do the same thing but would be easier to come by and less expensive? I'm not that obsessed with good audio, or the brand name, and I don't care when it's from (whether it's a vintage device or more recent). I'd prefer something relatively small (like, smaller than the D6C), but really the important thing is price and recording ability.	Gidonka	t3_6dyvar

What needs?  Video editing? windows has Adobe Premiere and Sony Vegas.  Music production? windows has Frooty loops studio.  Photo editing? Windows has photoshop.

t3_6ecz6i	t1_di9g21g	1496214160	I feel OP has no grasp of what he's talking about at all.  We're talking a compact camera with a sensor size of a gopro (1/2.3") here. You don't get a whole lot more MP in that size. GoPro went with 12 Mp with the same sensor size.   But sure, if OP is used to diving with a DSLR of 20+ MP and a dive house that costs 3 times as much as this camera, then I understand him completely that he thinks it's useless, but then he's in no way what so ever the target audience either.	picardo85	t1_di9foph
t3_6e6pfs	t1_di9g4i0	1496214337	No headphone jack, only comes in ginormous phablet size, top camera cuts into the screen, has an undersized battery (when battery life is still one of the biggest complaints on phones), and is expensive to boot.  I guess it has decent internal storage for once at least, but otherwise I have no idea who this is supposed to appeal to, or how it matches up with the name.	noratat	t1_di80ri7
t3_6e6pfs	t1_di9g6rl	1496214501	Not unless there's a normal-sized version. I bought the Pixel specifically because it was the smallest flagship I could buy, I can't stand phablets that require two-hands to use comfortably (and no, the fingertip balance crap doesn't count, I mean *actual* one-handed use).  And that's leaving out the other "essentials" this phone is missing that I'd be looking for even in a cheaper model, much less a flagship, like reasonable battery size or waterproofing.	noratat	t1_di8a3bl

t3_6eck1a	t1_di9mib1	1496231390	Maybe that's how you feel, but I can see why a lot of people would feel quite differently. These typically are for the people who want a dependable rugged phone. I feel that most wouldn't want to have to bother with changing out batteries. Especially when everyone charges their phone overnight (less likely to receive a call) and only have to do it upwards of once a week. If I was personally designing the phone I would have made the same decision if it had a meaningful impact on the battery life/maximum power over time based on the market they are trying to reach.	caz0	t1_di9lu1e

t3_6ecz6i	t1_di9ms38	1496231903	I'll hold off until I see what the photos look like.  From what I've read in reviews, the AW120 and AW130 take much worse quality photos than the AW100.  I'd also like to see a sealed lens compartment.  My AW100 fogs on the inside of the outer element (which I think is just a glass or plastic shield) when going from a warm area to a cold one.  It's really annoying to have a great shot lined up and see a blur on the display.  No, it isn't damaged or defective, this is a known problem.	PinochetIsMyHero	t3_6ecz6i

The new Canon and Nikon prosumer $700 DSLRs still only do HD and on top of that have a 20 minute recording limit.   (Don't tell me its import duties when it's  $700 product and a $300 phone doesn't have that limit.)	shouldbebabysitting	t1_di9miv2
t3_6ecz6i	t1_di9uio0	1496242699	I should have clarified; useful to me. Even at 10 meters which is reachable by most people snorkelling (assuming they either aren't wearing a wetsuit, or are wearing a wetsuit and weights) I'd still be more inclined to trust something that claimed to be good to 30m.

And we're not talking about choosing one or the other; _everyone,_ or at least everyone who might be interested in this camera, already has a phone whose video specs match this camera's.

Also Intel routes 20+ lanes through their chipset for extra pcie slots, 10gbps NICs, and 3 x m.2 slots. AMD appears to be routing from the CPU directly to 10Gbps NICs, and M.2 slots.  Intel. 44 lanes on CPU + 24 lanes on chipset = 68  Edit: This is just to show that you have up to a total of 68 pcie 3.0 lanes in use on the motherboard. The 24 pcie 3.0 lanes are provided through the chipset on a Intel board using the X299 chipset. The 44 lanes from the CPU go to the Pcie slots. 24 pcie 3.0 lanes from the chipset run to your slots, 3 x m.2 slots, 2x 10gb NICs  AMD.  60 lanes on CPU + 4 lanes on chipset = 64  Edit: This is just to show that you have up to a total of 64 pcie 3.0 lanes in use on the motherboard.There is 60 lanes from the CPU to the pci express slots, dual 10gb nic and 2x m.2 slot. There is 4 extra pcie lanes from the AMD chipset to a 3rd m.2 slot. Everything else is non pciexpress stuff off the X399 chipset.  Edit: This comparison shows the total pcie lanes available between your CPU/PCH. This gives a better comparison between AMD and Intel. You can review this info in the x299 and x399 datasheets.	ranmakei	t1_diabdf0
t3_6efdkt	t1_diadgov	1496262993	This. This sounds cool but it's applications are really severely limited. Just trying to put out something new I guess to get consumers excited and think it makes their PC better when they may not even notice a difference at all. I had an 8 core processor for a while and I think I only ever came across one thing that ever was able to actually utilize more than 4 and even then it was horribly optimized. Who in the hell is going to want to multithreaded code for 18, I just don't see a point outside of maybe running large amounts of statistical data In something like SAS.	dareftw	t1_di9x2n7

The software I use will absolutely saturate these cores, and I'll love it!  Also, I'm seeing more and more 5k and larger video being shot, which I need to be able to deal with. Currently post production hardware is struggling to keep up with camera advancements, so these are great news	EditorD	t1_diadgov
t3_6efdkt	t1_diae0ry	1496263618	Here is a few examples:  *Streaming on twitch and recording a offline copy at 1080p  *encoding home videos in Adobe premier @ 1080p or better without GPU.  *Compressing backups for your system  *multitasking: having 40 tabs open, youtube, a game, and music streaming  *If your a software dev: Emulation, compiling, and IDE.  4K YouTube videos on older multicore systems will see a benefit since it will max all your cores and allow you to watch it. The new Kaby Lake systems have dedicated 4K decoding and encoding, freeing up your cores for other things.	ranmakei	t1_diadgov
t3_6ecz6i	t1_diaedv9	1496264021	I had the previous version of this Camera.  Took it with me during a scuba dive and water seeped in. Asked Nikon to replace or fix as it was still under warranty and was told that the warranty is void if damage is due to water...

t3_6efdkt	t1_diaemnd	1496264289	Yes, but none of those lanes are saturated. Unless you can find a PCIE 3.0 device that transmits 32GB/S on all of its lanes, the bus isn't saturated, which means they can be used for more devices.	Optix334	t1_diadd5k

"So as long as your network operator is cooperative and has embraced the cutting edge, this mobile connection will be fast, too."  ...So, "never"?  :)  Love the idea, but let's be realistic - People only connect to WiFi *today* whenever possible because it doesn't cost $10/gig and throttle (or outright block) us based on what we want to use it for.

t3_6ecz6i	t1_diaiec7	1496268708	So I had one of the older ones rated to 90ft underwater I believe. I was recording about 20 minutes of footage and our dive instructor took us to an underwater cliff and we went down to 120ft. At about 110ft-115ft, the screen started caving it and it immediately shut off without saving any of the previous 20 minutes :(. Nothing against the camera since I took it further than its limit, just something I thought I'd share. GoPro handled it like a champ though	m45a84c53	t3_6ecz6i
t3_6ecz6i	t1_diaiqje	1496269138	My sister broke a previous model by dropping it on a tile floor from a couple feet while reviewing photos. The rear glass cracked and ruined the waterproofing.

t3_6ecz6i	t1_diajpi8	1496270370	Dedicated cameras are only good for high end or niche purposes like action stuff. Real water proofing or real lenses on a full frame camera. I'd love it if smartphones could somehow add medium frame or full frame sensors and lense mounts, but then you don't have a device that can fit in your pocket anymore. Also, I'm never gonna strap an iPhone to my mountain bike or my helmet snowboarding so action cams are still useful and will continue to be. I see phones making pro cameras obsolete before making action cams obsolete.  So it makes sense that Nikon is making this camera	Made_in_Murica	t3_6ecz6i
t3_6efdkt	t1_diak4hb	1496270898	My point is that all the lanes are used up, not so much that they were saturated.   NVME SSD's, Dual port 100Gbps NICs, Thunderbolt 3 for 2x 4K 60hz  video feeds will saturate their links.   I can see all lanes getting saturated in servers fitted for virtualization clusters with all NVMe storage over the NICs.

t3_6efdkt	t1_dialp1q	1496272957	The higher end Gen 6 Intel Core I7 cpu's supported 32 3.0 pcie lanes. It required motherboards with two chipsets to utilize it. This means you could have two GPU cards running at 16x. Four at 8x. No games utilized it unless custom modded and running at or above UHD resolutions.  The higher end Gen 7 Core I7 cpu's dropped this support and only support the standard 16 3.0 pcie lanes. Why? Because they didn't sell. Those motherboards I spoke of? Are still selling at +900$, even though they are last Gen. To my knowledge Gigabyte is the only company that has made any mobo's that support 32x 3.0 pcie lanes for the Gen 7 cpu's, but there would be no point in purchasing any of them (+1000$) because without the cpu support, it won't even work.  Point is, this hardware is not for your average or typical user. It isn't even for most professional users. And most certainly is not for any gamer.

Maybe distribution is part of the cost but if you are already paying for a service, the HD version really can't be that much more of a hassle for hulu.

t3_6ehllf	t1_diamrqq	1496274379	Cool. Now can one of them get their head out of their ass and let you easily open up an android window in Windows?	commentfreely	t3_6ehllf
t3_6ecz6i	t1_diamsa9	1496274399	Our own Eric Bangeman captured the sentiment of the time with an article titled "YouTube’s future (or lack thereof)." The company raised a total of about $11.5 million in VC funding at the time, but at 200Tb a day in data, bandwidth cost an estimated $2 million a month. Despite YouTube's cash flow problem, Ars at the time noted advertising was "unobtrusive," with only "one or two ads on a page" and no pre-roll.	Dahkma	t1_diamlem

t3_6ecz6i	t1_diamukp	1496274487	looks decent. I wish camera makers would use fewer, higher quality pixels though rather than higher, shitty pixels.  No one is going to take a picture where they can actually use the 16MP with this camera.	7BOomeRanG7	t3_6ecz6i

t3_6ecz6i	t1_diamwoo	1496274565	the fool's fool.  Since he was easy to fool by a fool.  Therefore the fool is foolier than the 1st fool.	7BOomeRanG7	t1_di9hlhw
t3_6efdkt	t1_diamxac	1496274588	Full blast, which still doesn't saturate the lanes.	Optix334	t1_dialo7a
t3_6ecz6i	t1_diamxmj	1496274600	I feel you were born in the US?   (se my comment on the difference between 'm' and 'M', just above)	Greybeard_21	t1_di9g21g
t3_6efdkt	t1_dian2oc	1496274788	It really bugs me how Intel are doing the X line. By forcing manufacturers to support all iterations, while at the same time massively limiting their potential with such a low lane count for the Kaby Lake X parts, people not in the know are going to put together what they think are high end systems and find out they can't even use all the features.  It's nice to see AMD go the opposite direction and just drenching folks in spare PCIe lanes	Tunnah1984	t3_6efdkt
t3_6efdkt	t1_dian3c2	1496274813	That may be true but it's not a fair comparison between different generation technologies that way. I was making the point of how a motherboard from a different era had a great deal of bandwidth for its PCIe 2.0 lanes, the fastest for its time.	Chrismax99	t1_diaiavw
t3_6ehllf	t1_dian3iq	1496274820	I'd much rather see a mini windows gaming PC running on a next gen tegra chip	Drackene	t3_6ehllf
t3_6efdkt	t1_dian52y	1496274878	Please show me one piece of hardware that saturates multiple PCIE lanes. I'll wait.   I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer btw. What's your job?	Optix334	t1_diagqm6
t3_6ehllf	t1_dianajg	1496275081	Main issue is this chipset won't be in devices shipping with full win10. So all it will be is a shittier way to play phone games as it will be locked to windows store.	arwegtsrfhbadfh	t1_dialsn8
t3_6ehllf	t1_dianbdk	1496275114	So you are saying TMobile, ATT, Verizon and Sprint don't have 1gbps capable networks behind their Wireless equipment? They are all on 10/40gbps links by now and moving to 100gb.	Velrix	t1_diaks0n
