Yates and those that tried to warn this infancy of a WH Administration with nearly little to now goverment experience (Except Flynn, Mad Dog and Kelly that are retired military) was acting in their best behalf; and them too stupid to recognize, know or care about the consequences.

I mean it was under his watch that Trump was able to gain a strong base and support while democrats did not feel as energized to get out and vote. The writing was on the wall a bit with the 2014 elections when the GOP had a strong showing but I don't think Obama helped there.  He is right you get the politicians you deserve but he was President for 8 years hard not to feel that he had some influence on the country and opened up the ability for Trump to win.  Edit : I am sure I will get some responses about the GOP being racists etc which I agree with 100%.

All she says is true, he spoke with the Russian ambassador on the topic of sanctions, but no promises or details are available.  I would think that if she has something she would have mentioned it during the questioning. She hides behind a fictitious requirement for secrecy.  What I have is that Flynn told the Russia ambassador was this:  "If you guys will get out of the Ukraine and Crimea and stop supporting the atrocities in Syria, I am sure we can do business. But not yet since I am not an official member of the administration in power."	Kabuki_Writer	t3_6a7wv8

This statement tells me more about how the White House interprets events and makes decisions than anything about Yates. Does Trump knowingly provide false or misleading information to sabotage political "opponents"? Seems like that's the implication from this statement. It also suggests that Trump will only EVER hire people he considers loyal to him, which essentially means that all his terrible ideas will be ok'd and celebrated instead of someone pointing out clear flaws.

t3_6a7s38	t1_dhcfj24	1494362683	There's some political whosawhatsit that claims that Obama hurt the national party by not turning OFA into a national movement to raise funds for races up and down the ballot... (at the same time that he pushed for the DNC to no longer accept lobbyist donations).    I'm not smart enough to know the truth behind that narrative.   What I DO know is that Obama went around saying 'Trump will not be president' for months and that is exactly the OPPOSITE message you want to send to inspire voter turnout.    Everyone has responsibility for the parts they played in what happened... I do think Obama could've done a few things differently to help the outcome. But I hold it against him not - he tried hard and was trying to accomplish the right goals.	sweatybronson	t1_dhcenfz
t3_6a7s38	t1_dhcfjy9	1494362711	&gt; I mean it was under his watch that Trump was able to gain a strong base  "How dare Obama be black!" That is literally his base and all he did to become the right's Emperor God.	mikes94	t1_dhcenfz
t3_6a7s38	t1_dhcfmgj	1494362787	"an effort to influence the primary vote."  That's just how they've always reported the votes.    The idea that Bernie lost because the media (per usual) reported super delegates alongside pledged delegate totals is bupkiss.    He lost because he ignored the south and was running against the idea of continuing the legacy of the party's very popular leader.	sweatybronson	t1_dhcesfp
t3_6a7s38	t1_dhcfoaq	1494362843	Along with caucuses, right?    Because those are what gave Bernie the illusion of a fighting chance.   Also: No. We should not have all open primaries... They should be semi-open or something. Trust me, in 2020 (if Trump isn't impeached) and there's no Republican primary, you have an open primary, you're going to have millions of Republicans voting in Dem primaries.     You'll have people like Rush limbaugh with millions of listeners giving marching orders.    Those protections are there for a reason - we don't want Republicans farking with Democratic primaries, which, if it were all totes open, they would totes all do.   EDIT: Also, new rule: When bringing up the oh-so-unfair primaries, y'all "Bernie lost because of everyone but himself"ers need to start making specific accusations instead of throwing out metaphors.  'coronation' and 'tilted the scales' are not specific accusations.	sweatybronson	t1_dhcdsfg
t3_6a7s38	t1_dhcfp1e	1494362865	&gt; but the media in coordination with the Democratic party were reporting the delegate counts before they declared  Like the fact that it was? Like how they did in 2008, and how Obama didn't bitch about it for one second.  &gt;in an effort to influence the primary vote  The media did that? No my sweet summer child. They were reporting on the facts, including that Clinton had the super delegate lead. To do so otherwise would have been dishonest.

He didn't say anything that's incorrect. Good, functioning democracies with accountable leaders that reflect our interests requires voter participation and it means people need to get out and vote.

What purpose is there to report it prior to when they officially declare and they can switch? Why not let the real primary "voters" decide the momentum of the race? Early on, Bernie tied in Iowa and won in New Hampshire, yet somehow no one switched like they did for Obama in February 2008.   But whatever, that's all spilled milk. And it's wasted time discussing the specifics of the 2008 and 2016 primaries. The super delegate system poisons the voting process in much the same way gerry-mandering does.

I'd argue that not prosecuting war criminals and not prosecuting banks among other things has been perpetuating a culture in which rich people are not held accountable at all in this country. With people like Obama telling us to forget the past and look forward, it has a real suppressive effect on the electorate- especially if you've lost loved ones in a pointless war or you lost your home. Both parties have only been servicing the rich and letting them get away with stealing your money and your lives.  Want to know what happened in 2016? It was the buildup of apathy from shit like that. How many dead soldiers and foreclosed houses are there from Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania? Would you have believed HRC was going to do anything about banks or wars? While she was out there saying America is already great?

What's the purpose in you getting all bend out of shape about it, if they don't matter in the end, like you said. :-) If anyone actually decided not to vote in the primaries because of the supers, then they were too stupid to even vote in the first place.   &gt;Early on, Bernie tied in Iowa and won in New Hampshire, yet somehow no one switched like they did for Obama in February 2008.  Clinton won Iowa, first of all. Even though it was the slightest win, like Mich. for Sanders, it was still a win. The supers didn't start switching until it was an even race. The first primaries were favorable to Sanders, so it was expected he'd win then. At no point was he an actual threat or even close to being a real contended. Remember Obama and Clinton had nearly identical popular vote total, Sanders lost to Clinton by 12% or 4 million votes. It wasn't close, and it was never going to be. If it had been, the supers would have started dividing like they did in 2008.   &gt;The super delegate system poisons the voting process in much the same way gerry-mandering does.  George McGovern and Trump are the reasons why we have superdelegates. And no, it does not operate the same way as gerrymandering does. Oh my sweet summer child.	mikes94	t1_dhcgn4l

It's not falsifiable.	turn-trout	t1_dhchr2h

I SUPPOSE it could just be coincidence that they coincide perfectly, that Bill and Obama and Biden et al. don't get nearly the level of shiat she does, but I doubt it.	sweatybronson	t1_dhcmje6
t3_6a7p4a	t1_dhcmr4l	1494370931	You left off the part where Yates gave White house Council Donald McGahn access to the evidence against Flynn on Jan 30th right before she was fired.       &gt;Yates asked to meet as soon as possible, and the pair met that afternoon -- Jan. 26 -- in a secure room at the White House, each joined by a senior staff member.  &gt;In that meeting, Yates emphasized that the Justice Department had two chief concerns: that Flynn had been compromised, and that he was lying to Vice President Michael Pence – which in turn was causing the administration to make false statements about Flynn.  &gt;"We were not accusing of Vice President Pence of knowingly providing false information to the American people. … We were concerned that the American people had been misled about the underlying conduct of what Gen. Flynn had done," Yates testified.  &gt;The pair met again at the White House the next day, on Jan. 27. McGahn, Yates said, asked whether the White House should fire him. "I told him that was not our call," she said.  &gt;McGahn asked to review the evidence that the FBI and Justice Department had gathered, and Yates arranged for him to do so on Jan. 30. The former acting attorney general said she called McGahn that day to inform him that the arrangements had been made for him to visit the Justice Department, but she told the committee she wasn't sure if he ended up following through on his request – she'd been fired by Trump that day for announcing she would not defend his travel ban.

But the idea that dead soldiers were driving things is ridiculous.   Trump appointed a foreclosure king as Treasury Secretary. A lot of people in Michigan and Pennsylvania are dupes. They voted for a con man who never met a bribe he didn't like. Are you arguing that Trump is for better regulations on banks than Clinton? You aren't, because you can't.   The people of the rust belt states were screwed over by Republicans blocking Obama's additional stimulus proposals from 2010 on, and responded by...voting for the people who were preventing them from getting help.

t3_6a7s38	t1_dhco5m5	1494372639	This isn't science, but it is reasoning.    Obviously, Berniecrats don't deal well with numbers and reality, or else they would actually look at the policies he proposed and how they didn't add up, but I digress:-)   The idea of Hillary Clinton as overly ambitious and exceptionally deceptive stems directly from "Lady Macbeth" stereotypes of women who seek power.  The research is settled that ambition is seen as an unlikeable trait in women... You know this, correct?   And in the 80s and 90s, Clinton, as a first lady of Arkansas and then America, repeatedly ran into the buzz saw of societal expectations for a woman. And when she transgressed them, she was unfairly branded a liar, deceitful, and overly ambitious.  It's a narrative that's stuck with her.    The double-standards are many and obvious.   Some [context](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/15/hillary-clinton-press-sexism-media-interviews)    Some more [of a pretty good summary](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-womack/stop-pretending-you-dont-_b_12191766.html)    And if you were a Berniecrat demanding Hillary release speeches (not the norm) while he didn't release his tax returns in any meaningful way whatsoever (the norm)...  Well, maybe you weren't being sexist, but you were being influenced by and supporting sexist narratives.  And if you think of Hillary as opportunistic, overly ambitious, and uniquely deceptive... There's no real reason to believe such things with any passion... outside of sexism.   Like, the Ghostbusters remake wasn't great... But the amount of hate against it? Of course it was misogyny.   Hillary's not the Ghostbusters remake... She's much better. Much better than a liar like Bernie, whose numbers never added up and who blames free trade for problems mostly caused by automation (Bernie might not be a much of a liar, but if he's not then he's kinda delusional... Though he did directly lie about a fair number of things, like his reason for not releasing his taxes and his reasons for flip-flopping on the Guest worker program and IR).	sweatybronson	t1_dhcn5y1

Who know.  http://www.visapro.com/b1-visa/overstaying-visa.asp  Consequences of Overstaying A Visa In USA  The issue of overstaying a visa in the U.S. while on a nonimmigrant visa has been receiving serious attention in recent years. Some of the consequences of overstaying your visa status are:  Visa overstays may be barred from returning to the U.S. for ten years or three years depending on the period of overstay or "unlawful presence".  Visa overstays may be restricted from applying for Extension of Stay or Change of Status.  Visa overstays will have their existing visa automatically revoked or canceled.   Visa overstays are generally unable to obtain a new visa except in their country of nationality.  Visa overstays may not be able to Adjust Status in the U.S. even if otherwise eligible.	bfwilley	t1_dhcy9n7

t3_6aagso	t1_dhd149n	1494389082	Doubted the legitimacy of this source, since I'd never heard of it, but the reported-on court filings are real, and the article's analysis is sound.  ---  &gt; However, a recent court filing by the Department of Justice on behalf of the FBI in an ongoing FOIA lawsuit plainly indicates the FBI has an active investigation pertaining to Donald Trump’s actions related to actual or potential election-related hacking and espionage by Russia.  -  &gt; The lawsuit is filed by Ryan Shapiro, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) PhD candidate/Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University research affiliate, and Jason Leopold, Senior Investigative Journalist at BuzzFeed News.  -  &gt;On August 18, 2016, Shapiro and Leopold submitted a FOIA request to the FBI seeking “disclosure of any and all records, including investigative records, mentioning or referring to Donald J. Trump’s statement on 27 July, 2016 [regarding Secretary Hillary Clinton’s State Department emails], ‘Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,’ and ‘I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.’”  -  &gt; When the FBI did not respond in a timely manner to the FOIA request, Shapiro and Leopold sued. During the lawsuit, the FBI initially asserted that it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of documents responsive to this FOIA request.   -  &gt; However, the FBI subsequently withdrew this position and agreed to search for the requested documents. Again, the documents requested by Shapiro and Leopold are records, including investigative records, mentioning or referring to a public statement made personally by Donald J. Trump, not his advisors, surrogates, or campaign staff.  -  &gt; In a court filing in this case on April 6, 2017, a Justice Department attorney representing the FBI informed the Court that there is an “active, ongoing investigation” pertaining to this matter and claimed that disclosing the “records that are responsive to the Russia Request” could reasonably be expected to interfere with “enforcement proceedings.” (As noted elsewhere in the DOJ/FBI’s new filing, the term “Russia Request” refers explicitly to Shapiro and Leopold’s FOIA request quoted above.) The DOJ/FBI’s new court filing acknowledges the existence of records responsive to Shapiro and Leopold’s “Russia Request”, and claimed that all, or virtually all, of these documents cannot be released because of the potential to interfere with active law enforcement proceedings.  ---  FBI glomars and then denies the request altogether, suggesting that the *public hacking request Trump made himself* pertains to an ongoing investigation.	ArePolitics	t3_6aagso
t3_6aagso	t1_dhd15tr	1494389152	TL;DR: after Trump publicly asked Russia to hack Clinton, someone submitted a FOIA request for any information pertaining to any FBI investigations of Trump's request.   The response from the FBI is that they can't release any documents, as that "could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings."  Now, it is beyond reason that the FBI would launch an investigation based solely on that statement.   But if they already had an investigation going, a public statement like that would definitely be added to the case file.	lordwumpus	t3_6aagso

It isn't only that they're under FBI investigation, or that their former chief editor is now "Chief Strategist" to the White House.   But the average *poster* of Breitbart articles never even bothers to post the actual title.  And Breitbart titles are ALREADY wildly misleading, biased, and manipulative.  And still, your average redditor linking to Breitbart consistently makes the decision to say, "gee, I know it's against site rules, but i gots me some editorializing to do on top of this editorializing!"   Can we ban it or come up with stickies?  Just a nice big red sticky that says "propaganda."   Or better yet, as with RT, just don't allow it.  Let's do your part so save this rapidly declining Democracy, eh?

t3_6aagso	t1_dhd1qzj	1494390128	He was absolutely lying in his letter. I'm 100% sure that line is only in the letter as a smokescreen and the letter was linked by Trump admin staff, for the specific purpose of trying to manipulate the public.   Why?  - Trump has a known extensive history of leaking beneficial personal "secrets" to the press via fake agents, third parties, lawyers and associates, etc.   - the one page of 2005 tax returns obtained by MSNBC a couple months ago had "Client Copy" stamped on it, and the info was very beneficial to Trump. No other tax info has been released aside from some from the 90's that more or less painted him to be a tax fraud.   - Comey heard about his own dismissal today from the TV news, while at an FBI office in LA. He thought it was a joke at first. If Trump was serious about the sentiment and messaging in that letter it would've been delivered to Comey personally and with more care and respect to his service and position.   This is a poorly executed cover up attempt and the messaging in the letter is nothing but deflection.	Jordy_Stingray	t1_dhd10rl

They will either not trust the independent investigator's report or say the person was paid off etc.. And if happened the other way, Republicans would say the same and say the evidence was fabricated.                  The fact is majority of the liberals don't care what the investigation conclusion is, they just want Trump gone/impeached. We saw that after the election night when tens of thousands were mad about it. They raised millions of dollars to do recounts and backfired. They called electors to not vote him and backfired. We saw that in the Women's March. We saw that in various other protests with "impeach trump" signs.

t3_6aagso	t1_dhd2d9x	1494391234	I wrote this else where tonight, but to expound on your point:  He's trolling the media.   WOW.   ###*Let's break this down:*  (**Edit:** context is that those bizarre statements in Trump's letter were lifted from Clinton campaign docs. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6aa70t/fmr_clinton_advisor_dag_letter_on_comey_lifted/?st=J2II0MWE&amp;sh=ed032252).)  In drafting this letter, Trump and Co. would have know there'd be swift backlash from Trump's "enemies" (real or imagined) by this move. And there would be considerable reason to expect crossover of those who had previously signed on to the Clinton campaign letter. By citing Clinton campaign language, they can then just turn around and say about those who raises hell about his firing of Comey and anyone else who hasn't been his rabid drooling child soldier (i.e. "enemies") . . .  WHAT HYPOCRITES! See?! Fake News!   The tactic is so pernicious because *it is intended to chip away at the public trust in media, pundits, and public figures*. In one fell swoop. *Don't trust the Media! Come only to our 2020 campaign page for REAL NEWS! You can't get the truth in the media!*   Truly. . .Ministry of Truth type shit.  ***Think the above is tin-foil-hat-worthy shit? Not really, this is real life:***  &gt; On top of the sloppiness, there is the lying. One veteran White House correspondent said he was warned by a transition official to be wary of good color emanating from the Trump camp on background. “They will screw with you,” the correspondent was told. “They will feed you things that are not true.”  &gt; Bannon, it is worth noting, is a devoted reader of the “neoreactionary” internet philosopher Curtis Yarvin, an advocate of the strategic benefits of spreading misinformation. ***But two people close to the administration say that White House staffers do much of their lying for sport, rather than to further any larger agenda.***  &gt; ***“They all lie,” said a conservative journalist with close ties to the West Wing, who described an informal contest to smuggle the biggest whoppers into print. “It’s a game to them.”***  &gt; A conservative activist close to the administration said a member of the White House communications team recently divulged the same to him over drinks. According to the activist, the staffer described the attitude inside the press shop toward lying to reporters as: “They’ll print what they want anyways, so we may as well have fun.”  [Trump’s Fake War on the Fake News](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/23/trump-loves-media-reporters-white-house-215043).   It's just a fucking game to them. And. . . I think Karen Finney just foiled their plan.   ---  And to add, let's just take down the argument right now that Dems can have no cause to object *now* because they had previously called for Comey to resign-- it's bullshit. Firstly, it's entirely irrelevant to the present situation.   Donald Trump is president. Since Comey's July press conference that Trump NOW cites as his cause for termination:   1) Comey helped get Trump elected;  2) Trump sung Comey's praises: Trump said in late October "it took a lot of guts" for Comey to inform Congress he was looking into new emails related to the Clinton probe. i.e. Trump had already submitted his tacit approval of Comey's actions regarding the Clinton email investigation and the timing is highly indicative of the cited reasoning (Comey's July press conference) being mere pretext for Comey's termination. (Pretext is a legal term that means *huge-scale fucking cover up*-- the technical definition, I believe).   Comey’s firing comes as the FBI investigates whether any Trump associates coordinated with Russia in its effort to meddle in last year’s election. So just suddenly *now*, Comey is incompetent? Because Trump certainly didn't think so after the election-- of course before investigation *into him* heated up. This week, we learned that Trump's financing with dirty Russian money schemes were being investigated.	the_well_hung_jury	t1_dhd1qzj

t3_6aakky	t1_dhd2r86	1494391957	Chiming in as an adult adoptee, I'm torn. Another POV is that it really is important for child development of adoptees to NOT have familial religious identity stripped from them.   Adoptees have enough to worry about, let alone being indoctrinated into a religion that isn't theirs. THEY didn't get to choose their parents. Check out [bastard nation](bastards.org).   I was raised in a Christian. All my friends think I look Jewish, but I was raised Christian. Who has the right to strip me of my religious heritage?  Maybe you guys can start an agency that specifically places Jewish babies in Christian homes, so those babies can be saved from their inferior religion.   That said, the folks who made this law are no friends of adopted babies and parents. Fuck them.   EDIT: Downvoters: are you anti-adoptee, or pro-religious discrimination?	johnfromberkeley	t3_6aakky

t3_6aajmh	t1_dhd309y	1494392439	&gt;If the "independent investigation" concluded Trump and his campaign did nothing wrong or did not collaborate with Russia, then liberals would not buy that. And if happened the other way, Republicans would say the same and say the evidence was fabricated.    A (correctly run) independent investigation will be able to back up all it's conclusions with facts, evidence, and as many legitimate sources as humanly possible. If there are those things (facts, evidence, and as many legitimate sources as humanly possible), then claims from *either* side will be null and void, because then they can just go and have a look at all the facts, evidence, and as many legitimate sources as humanly possible that the independent investigation has brought to light.    &gt;they just want Trump gone/impeached    Of course they do.  Donald Trump and his administration have already committed several actions that many Americans (and the constitution) consider impeachable.   We don't want a president who is so willing to lie to the public.   We don't want a president who is a racist.   We don't want a president who lacks all form of professionalism and knowledge of world politics.   We don't want a president who uses the presidency for his own personal gain.

t3_6aajmh	t1_dhd3b2v	1494393020	Then you get questions like this from **both** sides if one side doesn't like the conclusion.  * Was the Independent investigation correctly runned? * Was the evidence cooked? * Were the sources paid?  * If the sources are anonymous, are they made up? * Was the Independent investigator secretly bought?      As I said, the liberals have wanted Trump gone so this is their only legal playbook for it to grasp on. To them, the investigation MUST go their way and nothing else. They minds have already been set long before the investigation was even made aware public.  &gt; Of course they do. Donald Trump and his administration have already committed several actions that many Americans (and the constitution) consider impeachable. &gt; We don't want a president who is so willing to lie to the public. &gt; We don't want a president who is a racist. &gt; We don't want a president who lacks all form of professionalism and knowledge of world politics. &gt; We don't want a president who uses the presidency for his own personal gain. &gt; We don't want a president who has so many ties to a hostile foreign power.

t3_6ab5h2	t1_dhd7drk	1494402686	Best way (I think) of putting it is this -   "After Clinton lost to Trump, many Democrats blamed Comey for what they viewed as his unprecedented interference in the election process, but most later came to see him as an independent figure in the Trump administration who would be critical to a fair and thorough investigation of any possible ties between Russia and Trump associates." [Link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/comey-misstated-key-clinton-email-evidence-at-hearing-say-people-close-to-investigation/2017/05/09/074c1c7e-34bd-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html?tid=sm_tw&amp;utm_term=.3dcb349ffbc0)  The shift in opinion Trump has had for Comey - provided his reasoning (Clinton email handling) - is questionable as well. He has these comments back in October when he sent the letter out, bearing appreciative remarks.   "But during the October rally, Trump said that while he disagreed with the July decision, Comey's October letter alerting Congress that the FBI had reopened the investigation changed his mind. "What he did, he brought back his reputation — he brought it back," Trump said. "He's got to hang tough because a lot of people want him to do the wrong thing. He did the right thing.""  But now it's the basis for which he is removing him.	ArcticISAF	t1_dhd6wh9
t3_6aavys	t1_dhd7ec1	1494402733	On Election Day, 8 Nov 2016, only 27.3% of eligible voters cast their ballots for Trump. [62.98 million](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133Eb4qQmOxNvtesw2hdVns073R68EZx4SfCnP4IGQf8/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true) of the [230.6 million](http://www.electproject.org/2016g) Voting-Eligible Population voted for Trump. 65,853,516 voted for Clinton. Trump lost the nationwide popular vote by a margin of 2.87 million popular votes. However, due to the archaic and obsolete U.S. Electoral College system and its flaw, Russian government interference in the election, and interference in the election by FBI Director James Comey, Trump won 56.51% of the Electoral College votes ([304 of 538](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016)), thereby attaining the necessary 50% threshold and winning the Electoral College by a margin of 6.51%; thus he won the election.        I do not intend to alarm you, but I think everyone deserves to know some facts about crazy Trump, crazy Kim Jong-un, and North Korea.            I think all Aussies should want Trump gone as much as most Americans, in part, because if Trump starts a war with Kim, or if Kim starts a war with Trump, North Korea has more than [1,000 missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People's_Army_Strategic_Force#Active_missiles), including the [KN-14 missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KN-14#New_KN-08_based_missile:_KN-14), which has a design target range (untested) of [12,000 km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People's_Army_Strategic_Force#Active_missiles), within design range of Sydney ([8,530 km](http://www.distancefromto.net/)) and Melbourne ([8,778 km](http://www.distancefromto.net/)). This missile is designed to carry a nuclear warhead. International experts do not know whether North Korea has been able to fit a nuclear warhead on this missile, yet, but North Korea can fit high-explosive, chemical, and biological warheads on its missiles.        Additionally, North Korea has [70 submarines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_North_Korean_ships). On August 24, 2016, North Korea [successfully launched](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/23/world/north-korea-missile-launch/) a [Pukkuksong-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KN-11#First_Completely_Successful_Pukkuksong-1_Test) ballistic missile (estimated target range [2,000-2,500 km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KN-11)) from a [Sinpo-class submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinpo-class_submarine). The submarine has a range of [2,800 km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinpo-class_submarine), but legally it can take on fuel from North Korean refueling ships anywhere outside of the 12 nm [territorial waters zone of any coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_waters). The Pukkuksong-1 missile is [designed to carry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KN-11) a nuclear warhead, but it is unknown to the outside world whether North Korea has been able to fit a nuclear warhead on this missile, yet.          International experts estimated that in June 2016, North Korea had [13-21 nuclear warheads](http://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/Pu_HEU_and_tritium_production_at_Yongbyon_June_14_2016_FINAL.pdf) (see document page 6). On January 7, 2016, international experts estimated nuclear weapons of North Korea have a blast yield somewhere between [6 to 15 kilotons](http://isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/from-the-sky-north-koreas-2016-nuclear-test/10). In comparison, the [Little Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy) atomic bomb that detonated over Hiroshima, Japan in August 6, 1945 had a blast yield of 15 kilotons.        Whatever you guys and your government can do to help get rid of Trump would help to make the world a safer place.        Reference: the [NUKEMAP](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/) (overlays Google Map) interactive online calculator and simulator shows one 6-kiloton airburst over Sydney would cause 25,580 fatalities and 68,930 injuries. A 15-kiloton airburst would cause 45,060 fatalities and 118,970 injuries.	Odawn	t1_dhd4jg5

t3_6ab5h2	t1_dhd7o7t	1494403534	Trump is playing with fire when he plays with American liberal democracy. Could his actions spark an armed insurrection within the United States? Is that possible? How many firearms are available to U.S. civilians? According to the U.S. Congressional Research Service (see document, [page 6](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32842.pdf)), in 2009, the number of firearms available to civilians in the United States was approximately 310 million, including 114 million pistols, 110 million rifles, and 86 million shotguns.        On October 5, 2015, using [official data](https://www.atf.gov/file/89561/download) (the 2013 update) from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosive, The Washington Post estimated that by 2013, roughly [357 million firearms](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/10/05/guns-in-the-united-states-one-for-every-man-woman-and-child-and-then-some/) were available to U.S. civilians, while the U.S. human population in 2013 was 317 million.          Today, the U.S. Census Bureau [Population Clock](https://www.census.gov/popclock/) has passed 325 million. I estimate the total number of firearms available today to U.S. civilians is somewhere between [366-400 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country). However, on September 22, 2016, USA Today [published an article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/09/22/study-guns-owners-violence/90858752/) stating that surveys by Harvard and Northeastern universities found only 22% of Americans owned firearms in 2015. This means an estimated 366-400 million firearms are available to an estimated 71.5 million U.S. civilians.        I think nearly all of the [18.8M](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/facts-for-features/2016/cb16-ff21.html) U.S. Veterans, [1.3M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces) Active duty and [0.8M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces) Reserve duty military personnel, and [348K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_of_the_United_States) U.S. National Guard personnel living in the United States—a total of about 21.2 million—own ammunition, pistols, rifles, and shotguns. I think many own bullet-proof Kevlar body armor, combat gear, and survival gear. Some legally own machine guns and automatic weapons. Some might have explosives. They know how to use firearms and weapons. They know how to fight in combat.        As of February 2015, [37 U.S. states](https://www.redcircletactical.com/machine-gun-ownership.html) allow legal ownership of machine guns and other automatic weapons. As of May 24, 2016, records in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record at the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) show, in a state-by-state report, that Americans legally own a total of [490,666](http://www.nfatca.org/pubs/MG_Count_FOIA_2016.pdf) machine guns (automatic weapons). For example: Florida, Texas and Virginia have more than [30,000](https://www.redcircletactical.com/machine-gun-ownership.html) registered machine guns in each state. The State of California no longer allows machine guns, but the state has more than [29,000](https://www.redcircletactical.com/machine-gun-ownership.html) registered machine guns.	Odawn	t3_6ab5h2

Particularly in that they've done nothing but call for "moving on" from one of the central reasons for the investigation.  And bafflingly, Trump himself still clings to Comey's authority by citing three supposed times where the former director said the President was not the subject of an investigation (though apparently not to the public.)  He can't have it both ways, where an issue that didn't bother him in January becomes a reason to fire him in May while also wanting people to take Comey at his word (even though he's never said them publicly.)	zherok	t1_dhd7t0h

Comey was actively working with the investigation and had in-depth knowledge of the case. When you get rid of him you at the very least slow the investigation, and potentially can derail it.

If that changes then that's a critical problem. I think it likely that DOJ prepped the material to dismiss comey, which ultimately needed to be done, and trump impulsively jumped the gun. Of course that's just conjecture but it's hardly a claim that Trump is smart--if anything, this impulsive step has given his critics ammunition to keep pressing on russia.	archamedeznutz	t1_dhdi5d1

t3_6ad620	t1_dhdnb27	1494431503	I don't like it either, and if you asked me I'd be in support of disaster relief funding.  I just find it frustrating that some people treat situations like this as a chance to grind their respective political axes.  People in NY and NJ are still stuck five years after Sandy hit, and part of that has to do with the enthusiasm in which red states used the hurricane as an opportunity to stick it to blue states.  This is not to say that there aren't other problems, but they played their role as well.

I don't think the problem Is a biased media. I think the problem is biased consumers of media that continuously show an appetite for the bullshit news that's out there. If the consumer demands fair and balanced coverage, media outlets will provide fair and balanced coverage. Both sides are guilty of the sensationalism appetite. But republicans seem to have this notion that balanced coverage means ignoring the ridiculous shit the president does, because they've already reported on something negative about him that day.

t3_6ae8wd	t1_dhdwtpd	1494441532	Franken: I arise to address Trumps STUNNING dismissal of Comey. We KNOW Russia has been involved in our elections. We don't yet understand all the reasons why they favored Trump, and these questions are part of the investigation.   Quoting Comey testimony on the scope of the investigation.  Timing of firing raises serious questions. It should shock the conscience of every american who believes no one is above the law.  WH attempted to cast blame on Sessions/Rosenstein, with documents to back up decision. But these docs create more questions than they answer.   First the letter from Trump: "While I greatly appreciate you informing me on 3 separate occasions...." This clumsy attempt at misdirection does nothing more than to remind us of his many connections to Russa.  2nd Sessions letter... Sessions should have had no involvement in this decision at all.  Having provided misleading testimony under oath, he was forced to recuse himself.  Rosenstein's memo on Comey's handling of the Clinton email.. Both Trump and Sessions celebrated his actions at the time.  Why not wait for conclusion of DoJ inspector general investigation?  These actions lead me to believe that something else is going on. Last night SHS said it is time to let this go....time to focus on things the American people care about."   In my view the timing is suspicious. Just this morning we learned the Comey had requested addtional funding.  Sessions and Rosenstein should come to the Senate and explain themselves.  And the situation now calls for the appointment of a special prosecutor.	TableTopFarmer	t3_6ae8wd

t3_6afu9l	t1_dhe8dsh	1494454090	The fact that people still think the GOP will check him, if he *just goes far enough*, is getting pathetic.  Do people not get what the Republican Party is? This is a nationalist, will-to-power party with no lord other than its own victory. They will march the country into hell before they turn on their own party.  This is party that defines itself, fundamentally, as being against liberals. There is no deeper principle. There other *other* principles, but they are all fundamentally subservient to their identity as opposing liberals and the culture they represent. There is nothing - nothing - Trump would do that would cause them to hurt him or their party to the benefit of Democrats. They will let an unstable narcissist light our government on fire and do nothing more than shrug. Because subservience to the will of this nutjob in the oval office is their primary fealty - just to justice, not to truth, not to country. To the Republican President, no matter who he is.  There can be no hope of justice for 18 more months. And even then, the idea that this government would permit itself to lose power to Democrats is getting harder to believe, despite the votes.  As freaked out as people have been over the past 24 hours, I fear they haven't been freakout out enough.  PS: One other thing to note - people need to remember that the fact that a coverup is happening, and you know its happening, doesn't mean it won't work. If someone is standing in front of you destroying evidence and you see them doing it, the evidence is still destroyed. Remember the CIA torture tapes, for example.  The fact that everyone knows Trump is covering up a Russia investigation doesn't matter as long as he has the power to do it. And he has that power. And no one with the power to stop him wants to stop him. There is no inevitable justice. He *can* get away with it in full view of everyone.	VStarffin	t3_6afu9l

t3_6afu9l	t1_dhe9b9v	1494455271	Yes.  But if they started impeachment proceedings against Trump today - that will likely take months to work out.  And then the Senate - if the House votes in favor of impeachment - has to decide on whether to convict/remove.  Plan for a couple more months on that.  If all of that started, there's no way any other legislation gets through in the interim ... everyone would be too tied up with that and passing a budget for 2018.  So I think Paul Ryan is just desperately hoping things don't go to complete shit before he can get his dream tax plan.  I'm not convinced things will work out that way for him ... but I honestly think that's probably what's going on.

They reportedly expected Republicans to back him up and thought Democrats wouldn’t complain loudly because they have been critical of Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Indeed, that was the dubious excuse given publicly for his ouster. But as all three cable news channels showed live footage of Comey’s motorcade winding through Los Angeles traffic en route to the private plane that would bring him home to Washington, the West Wing shifted into damage-control mode.

Remember: The biggest lie they tell their audience is that they can't trust *any other news source.*  Fox not only tells them exactly what they want to hear, but that people who *don't tell them what they are to hear* are lying to them.      I'm in the same boat you are, but how many people still think that homosexuals are evil because it says so in the bible, when a ten minute conversation with the average gay person would prove that they are, in fact, fabulous?      Scientology is a thing too, and anti-vaxxers, shit man, I was a Wiccan in high school.	MaximumEffort433	t1_dheoif9

t3_6agc58	t1_dhep5wq	1494476626	Bernie is the one who caused this whole mess. He shouldn't have continued his campaign so long, and told everyone Hillary was a crooked, racist, wall street crony who was rigging the primary against him. Trump had a lot of rich supporters but nobody aided him more than Bernie Sanders. Maybe if Bernie showed some respect for democracy Hillary would be in office, we'd have a progressive SCOTUS, wouldn't be fucking up foreign policy, wouldn't be ripping up crucial trade deals designed to limit China because conspiracists fear the word globalism, and we'd actually do something about climate change. But no Bernie had to have it his way or no way.	DonaldBlythe	t3_6agc58
t3_6ahfzt	t1_dhep81t	1494476724	I agree that confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance are powerful forces. But there has to be an effective way to combat this, and it starts with the individual. These people are literally lying to themselves.   The goal has to be to get these people to understand their current attitudes and behaviors, and the costs involved in holding these particular attitudes or engaging in their current behavior.   If they're not willing to make an effort or engage with information that lies outside their alternate universe, or really evaluate the decisions they've made (which has been the case for the past 10-15 years really), where does that leave us in terms of politics? Or even daily life?   The ball is entirely in their court, as I see it.	BlueSwoosh248	t1_dheoue8
t3_6ahfzt	t1_dhepk68	1494477304	The ball *is* in their court, but...  Here.      You say:      &gt;I agree that confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance are powerful forces. But there has to be an effective way to combat this, and it starts with the individual. These people are literally lying to themselves.      But *they don't think they're lying to themselves,* they think *we're lying to them.*      Why would anyone change their opinion if they're convinced that their opinion is right?  Why would they look outside of Fox news if they think Fox is telling them the truth?      "You can drag a horse to water, but you can't make him drink."      These horses don't know they're thirsty, and they think the water is poison.  Why would they ever drink poisoned water when they're not even thirsty?      I get what you're saying, I do, but if it was as simple as presenting them with truthful information then Donald Trump would have lost in a landslide.  They have to *want* to change their mind, and there's no way to make them do that.  I spent twenty years trying to get my mom to quit smoking, but she won't quit until *she wants to.*      You're 100% right in what you're saying, but you're forgetting that we're on the outside looking in, and they're on the inside looking out.  Their view of the world is *completely* different from ours.      Dammit, I shouldn't have gotten into this discussion before going to bed.  Now I'm gonna' be up all night...

t3_6agc58	t1_dhepsm7	1494477687	tldr: it depends on proving Trump's intent to obstruct, which is set at a very high bar. The only viable enforcement mechanism is impeachment.  Okay, now my opinion, even though this situation seems worse than Nixon's, I still doubt the GOP will do anything since they hold power.

The fake dating website tried to trap Julian into accepting money from Russia and then when he wouldn't, accused him of a sex crime in the Caribbean (can't remember which country).   It was all very strange. Seemed to be an attempt to discredit Assange. No idea who was behind it but Noam's name was on it.   This is not my personal opinion on the matter this is only facts.

I felt the dark cloud hovering over our country when Bush announced we were invading Iraq.  No disrespect to the victims of 9/11 or the survivors, but for months I've been saying that this situation is much, much worse. This is an attack from *the inside* - not the *outside* - and that dark cloud I felt in '03 is back, and it's even darker.  Your comment is very eloquent, and it spells out to both sides the position we find ourselves in. Having known a pre- and post-9/11 world, I'm sad to say that I think the terrorists accomplished their goal. Terrorism leads to fear, and fear leads to weakness &amp; irrationality.  Trump supporters need to understand - what you're witnessing **isn't** a knee-jerk reaction to a republican president. This isn't partisan disagreement.

If they see that the cost of doubling down on lying, but paying out non-permanent punishments is less costly than coming forward with the truth; provided they are able to maintain and sustain the illegal doings; they will elect to *always go through with the doubling down on the lying*.   so that this should not be news; the concept at its core can be driven right back to marketing 101 (outside of the actual intent of doing things illegal for the sole benefit of you and the cost of society; i mean generally advertisers aren't exactly bent on that in definition), but that it's clear this administration is in fact bent on that exact thing. Why?  because their illegal actions stand to upend a lot of what this country *is* and tip *all* the scales into this administration's favor. Not one person should be surprised at all, in any way; when the people perpetrating this crime are, in fact the same people that *can choose whether said people get in trouble for said crimes* and thus choose not to go forward with what would be considered fair legal practice and letting the courts decide the law, like they are supposed to.   this is people actively wanting our democracy to not be a democracy at all anymore because our "democracy" failed them, and so we now have people saying it should be legally and socially acceptable to have a King Trump.

Hillary but not Sanders being given debate questions in advance doesn't either?  DNC officials specifically discussing ways to smear Sanders doesn't seem like it might be overstepping their official position of neutrality?  This isn't even getting into the actual election manipulation, like the Nevada DNC changing rules to favour Hillary despite not having the majority support required to do so, or the hundreds of thousands of voters mysteriously purged. In multiple states. With independent systems. "Clerical error" doesn't account for that.  Edit: Not to mention the 5 or so senior DNC members who resigned in disgrace when the emails came out. If there was no evidence of impropriety, you'd think they would at least have fought it a little.  Edit 2: And the DNC's response to the data breach was in clear violation of their contract. This was a while ago and I'm just listing things off the top of my head, but seriously, the DNC was not impartial. I don't think they're even particularly bothering to pretend they were. Hell, their main defense in the current court case seems to be precisely that they were never *required* to be impartial.	AnthropicSynchrotron	t1_dhexyu2

t3_6agc58	t1_dhf2yo4	1494508273	&gt;So, the debate schedule being intentionally limited at the request of Hillary's campaign  The DNC scheduled the exact same number of debates in 2016 that it did in the 2008 primary.     You're right that the frontrunner always wants fewer primary debates and the challenger always wants more, but nothing was "changed" at the "request" of the Hillary campaign.  &gt;Hillary but not Sanders being given debate questions in advance doesn't either?  That has nothing to do with the DNC or the Hillary campaign.     &gt;DNC officials specifically discussing ways to smear Sanders  Some people were emailing each other in private conversations ways they can do that.  None of those were actually done.  More to the point, none of those emails went to the Hillary campaign.  You are accusing the Hillary campaign of "colluding" with the DNC to "rig" the primaries.   But absolutely no collusion happened; if it had it would show up in the emails.   And no primaries were "rigged".     The Nevada caucus was a clusterfuck in almost every way, but the final result was exactally what the caucus voters initially wanted, albiet almost by accident .   &gt;or the hundreds of thousands of voters mysteriously purged. In multiple states. With independent systems.   Systems usually run by state republican parties, like in Arizona.

t3_6agc58	t1_dhf4n8t	1494510586	&gt;The DNC scheduled the exact same number of debates in 2016 that it did in the 2008 primary.  This is categorically untrue. There were 26 debates in the 2008 primary and only 9 in the 2016 primary, of which only 6 were originally planned. Including the town halls (or, in the words of Stephen Colbert "debates that no one watches") that the non-Clinton campaigns had to actively fight for doesn't bring the number up to 26, either.  As for the collusion, you might want to read [this email](https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5688#searchresult) from the Clinton campaign to the DNC specifically requesting a limited debate schedule.  Edit: The relevant part:  "Through internal discussions, we concluded that it was in our interest to: 1) limit the number of debates (and the number in each state); 2) start the debates as late as possible; 3) keep debates out of the busy window between February 1 and February 27, 2016 (Iowa to South Carolina); 4) create a schedule that would allow the later debates to be cancelled if the race is for practical purposes over; 5) encourage an emphasis on local issues and local media participants in the debate formats; and 6) ensure a format that provides equal time for all candidates and does not give the moderator any discretion to focus on one candidate."   &gt; That has nothing to do with the DNC or the Hillary campaign.  If a DNC official (Donna Brazile) is handing over the debate questions and the Hillary campaign is receiving them, I'd say that it has about as much to do with both of them as anything can ever have to do with anything.  &gt; None of those were actually done. More to the point, none of those emails went to the Hillary campaign.  It seems naive at best to suppose that DNC officials would discuss ways to attack the Sanders campaign as a purely intellectual exercise. Clearly some action was at the very least planned, and almost certainly executed via any of the means I mentioned plus any of the countless smears that appeared in the media.  Further, why is it a counterpoint that these were internal emails? It supports the DNC bias claim and does nothing to disprove the collusion claim. Other forms of communication exist, and emails between the Clinton campaign and the DNC (see above re: debate schedule) exist.  &gt;But absolutely no collusion happened; if it had it would show up in the emails.  Because emails are the only way people communicate ever, especially when they're doing things they don't want other people to find out about. /s  Also, there was evidence of collusion in the emails anyway. *Certainly* enough evidence to warrant an independent investigation. Even skeptics should at the very least be calling for this rather than being partisan and dismissive.  &gt;Systems usually run by state republican parties, like in Arizona  Source? And can you prove that the DNC had no sway whatsoever?  &gt;And those massive screw ups probably hurt Hillary more than Bernie, if you look at where they happened.  Again, you will need to substantiate your claim. I'll substantiate mine in the meantime.  In Brooklyn, the people purged were (uniformly) irregular voters.  Now have a look at [this New York Times article](https://www.google.co.za/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic9evK_efTAhVqDsAKHV_WCC4QFgghMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F01%2F26%2Fupshot%2Fbernie-sanders-is-very-dependent-on-infrequent-voters.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1HxB0lcVLmdR0Wsv1llaeeBU-oQ&amp;sig2=TAv-byP9v6kXGJf3LQZNMQ) about the nature of Bernie's base.

t3_6agc58	t1_dhf71ih	1494513513	This might all be true if trump were seen as a sane and rational person. Instead, it looks like a deliberate attempt to disrupt the investigation in any way he can devise.  Assume he is guilty, what else is he going to do? Assume he is innocent and it just needlessly makes him look guilty anyway. What a strange move to make.	trrSA	t1_dhf2gbz
t3_6agc58	t1_dhf7cj5	1494513868	&gt;This is categorically untrue. There were 26 debates in the 2008 primary and only 9 in the 2016 primary, of which only 6 were originally planned.   Most of the 2008 debates were unofficial debates.   The DNC only scheduled 6 official debates in 2008, just like in 2016.  And in 2008 the DNC tried to discourage candidates from attending unofficial debates, everyone just ignored them.  &gt;It seems naive at best to suppose that DNC officials would discuss ways to attack the Sanders campaign as a purely intellectual exercise.   It was one guy brainstorming some fairly terrible ideas about how to attack Sanders in a private email to someone else.    As far as we know the head of the DNC never even saw that email.  And certainly nobody from the Hillary campaign did.  After the email hack that guy got fired, and I'm glad; I'm an athiest and the fact that a democrat was even considering attacking someone for that is pretty offensive.     There's no reason to think it ever went further than that though.  &gt;Source? And can you prove that the DNC had no sway whatsoever?  In every state, the voter registration system is kept by the state government.    They keep track of who is registered to vote, where they live, and what party they are registered to.    You can get on the state's voter registratoin list by registering to vote or when you register your car, and when you do you are asked what party you are registered to.  That's what got screwed up; somehow people who were supposed to be registered democrats were registered as independents instead.   It's a really serious issue and we need to make sure it never happens again.    But that's run by the state government, which in Arizona means it's run by Republicans.  There was also a major screw up in New York.  But notice there, it hurt people living in a single part of New York City, which Hillary won big, not upstate New York where Bernie got more votes, so it doesn't really make sense to think the state government did that deliberately to help Hillary.  I think that our whole voting infrastructure has a lot of problems and badly needs an upgrade, but I don't think there's any reason to assume anyone was trying to cheat here.	Yosarian2	t1_dhf4n8t

I'm not saying he did anything illegal like the Trump team. I'm saying there was 3 large infusions of cash into the Sander's campaign which Sander's said he'd disclose the source but never did. Also that it is unfair to not at least question the ties. I'm not saying sander did anything illegal, but that maybe we are being led astray in the fact that the Russians are only influencing one side of the aisle. Rather be safe and check both sides now rather than wait for any congressional races. Historically Russian influencers go for the left side of the aisle, and as recently as CalEXIT shows that hasn't changed yet.  The goal is the provide fringe aspects of the spectrum a soapbox.	madnandisel	t1_dhf8y23

To pretend otherwise is just bizarre.  Given you just continue to restate the point that the 'FBI doesn't just stop' I figure you're either suggesting the FBI is inherently politicised and any investigation they conduct into political activity is without a shred of honesty or you're incredibly dense.

Hillary won by that margin precisely because 114000 mostly-Bernie voters were gone.  Perhaps it was a coincidence, but it looks a lot like gerrymandering, which we know is very much real. Regardless, it warrants investigation.  Anyway. I suppose we'll see if the lawsuit uncovers anything further.	AnthropicSynchrotron	t1_dhf7cj5
t3_6agc58	t1_dhfku8d	1494528432	&gt;Which is consistent with the claim that the voters who were deregistered probably would have supported Bernie.    That doesn't really make sense.   Hillary predictably had more support in more diverse urban centers, Bernie had more support in northern New York, which makes sense since that's more similar to the New England states he did really well in.  If someone had wanted to help Hillary win the state they'd have screwed up a bunch of voter registrations from upstate New York and therefore reduced the number of Bernie voters.   Screwing up registrations in New York City would be more likely to hurt Hillary then help her.	Yosarian2	t1_dhfkgg5

t3_6am5i3	t1_dhftb2d	1494537347	My guess is that post was a response to exactly what I noted - the post being downvoted to oblivion simply because it points out wrongdoing by a democrat party member. That's not allowed in r/politics.	Spicy_Clam_Sandwich	t1_dhfs8md
t3_6agc58	t1_dhftt80	1494537929	&gt;Again, the voters who were purged were specifically voters who were registered but had not voted recently/regularly.   That's actually been common practice in many places for a long time now to remove people from the voting rolls who have not voted recently.    It's an outdated practice that we should stop, but they've been doing it for decades.  I think the bigger problem in New York was that some people were registered but somehow were listed as independent even though they had registered Democrat, and so weren't allowed to vote in the closed primary.   In that case I haven't seen any evidence that that affected Bernie supporters more than Hillary supporters.	Yosarian2	t1_dhfm5u6

t3_6am5i3	t1_dhfuoqt	1494538963	It has everything to do with what the OP posted. OP claimed that liberals "Can't look in the mirror". In this context, OP is saying that people are denying Brown is guilty. There were literally no comments to that effect. OP made a false insinuation that people were denying what happened in an attempt to portray liberals as somehow hypocritical/in denial/unable to accept that a democrat broke the law. I get it though, reading comprehension can be tough :).	Robert_T_Pooner	t1_dhfujl9

The nuance to explain why Comey needed to be fired but not by the only man who can fire him doesn't exist.  Our dear leaders are idiots.

t3_6am5i3	t1_dhfvev5	1494539813	It wasn't relevant to the topic at hand. At all. Which is Corrine Brown. Stop trying to steer this elsewhere continuously. It's so ridiculous. Honestly.  The reason he said "can't look in a mirror" is because you guys upvote literally ANYTHING anti Trump. But downvote everything like this. This sub has become laughable to a huge Reddit audience.  You also didn't "defeat" anything. I simply didn't think your "argument" was worthy of a real response. Because it's the same crap everyone in this sub constantly spews.	Bittysweens	t1_dhfv3qd

OP was crying that people "can't look in the mirror" when I see no evidence in this thread of that really happening.   Now, let's see how well you and OP can look into that mirror following the FBI raiding a major GOP consulting firm, subpoenas being issued for Flynn and other former top Trump aides, and the revelations about the purpose behind Comey being fired.

t3_6am5i3	t1_dhfvvbp	1494540364	Well of course it does. She is no longer even serving in the government and Trump is the current POTUS. It's entirely natural that the incredibly controversial and unprecedented goings-on of the past few days are going to overshadow this.

The insurance we get is actually a real useful product now that provides real healthcare.  And *despite* these massive improvements, the premiums still have risen at a *slower* rate than they were rising before ACA.  Of course we could have done more, and made it better, but the blame for that rests with the Republicans who sabotaged the subsidies in every budget bill, and states that rejected the Medicaid expansion.	bleed_air_blimp	t1_dhfy67z

It's actually impressive how bad we are at it, as good as the actual treatment itself can be (if you can afford it, which many of us can't.)

Joe Liberman, one of those independents, refused to support a health care plan with a public option.  As your source points out, he threatened to filibuster it.  Not to mention, one of the seats to make up that 60 was vacant a large portion of that time due to the Senator having health issues and his replacement not being elected yet.

t3_6anlt1	t1_dhfz66m	1494544594	The argument is that it encourages people to not work because they know they'll be taken care of anyways.  Got into a conversation yesterday with my father. He owns a restaurant and says a lot of people just work long enough to get unemployment and then get themselves fired so they can "play" without having to work.  He said that we should stop requiring emergency rooms to treat people with catastrophic illness because that would further encourage people to get a job.  I wish I were kidding. There were two other people at the table who agreed with him.	itstimeforanotherone	t1_dhfyc6h
t3_6anlt1	t1_dhfz7mk	1494544647	That and the fact that the 60 includes 2 independents are often forgotten.  They effectively had 58 because of Kennedy and because Liberman threatened to filibuster if there was a public option.	Crocoduck_The_Great	t1_dhfytyp

t3_6anlt1	t1_dhfzevv	1494544913	No, it isn't dumb. In order for health insurance companies to remain open in a free market, they must provide better care at cheaper prices than their competitors. The more companies, there are, the more competition there is, which leads to better care at lower prices. That most certainly includes coverage for high risk individuals.	Final_Smash	t1_dhfz9mw

t3_6anlt1	t1_dhg08wg	1494546041	what a crock.   I assume your facts only compare premiums and not out of pocket costs.  The cost of insurance my own family had before vs after Obamacare is more in line with the article than with your facts. I had to join the exchange for the first time this year. Yes, my monthly premiums are slightly above what I paid the past years. The difference is coverage and out of pocket expenses. I now have to pay hundreds of $ out of pocket in order just to reach my tripled deductible. I would go back to pre-Obamacare in an instant, even with the 1-2 Obamacare improvements. it wasn't worth it for most.	rznfcc	t1_dhfy73f

He didn't make any changes when he took office, even though he got rid of lots of other people. Then Comey makes statements about the Russia probe, and asks for additional resources, and suddenly what Comey did last year is a fireable offence.

His supporters saying "he didn't collude with Russia, he won't be impeached" seem to forget that obstruction of justice, of this sort, can be grounds for impeachment.   Whether he's doing this because he's protecting Flynn and/or Manafort and/or other campaign members for their dealings with Russia, or whether he's doing it because he was personally and willfully involved in collusion, or whether he's just an innocent, senile, narcissistic old man who had no improper dealings with Russia and is simply doing this because he thinks the investigation is stupid, it very well may be his efforts to obfuscate and to derail the investigation that form the substance of Articles of Impeachment.  That being said, impeachment for obstructing justice is very different from impeachment for treason/colluding with a foreign adversary. The latter would, one can only hope, result in jail time.  **TL;DR If his Russian dealings don't get him (maybe he *is* actually innocent, I don't believe that, but maybe he is), obstruction of justice and derailing this investigation *will*.**	cr42	t3_6anvzw

Rinse and repeat.  They also deny claims for stupid reasons like you missed your doctor's visit or you ate sushi.  That's the free market at work. It's not about providing better care but removing people that are too expensive.   Try switching providers and guess what now you have a very expensive pre existing condition.   It doesn't work because health care is inelastic.

t3_6anlt1	t1_dhg1mat	1494547943	Do you even know what pre existing condition is????   It's a condition that you have before you get health insurance from a company that the insurance company will not cover.

t3_6anvzw	t1_dhg1mfb	1494547948	Trump's confidence that the FBI will find nothing illegal is worrying me. Could he actually be smart enough to pull off collusion with Russia without a trace? We definitely know the Russians funded Trump's businesses because his son's have admitted such. So without having a verbal agreement, Russia knew that if they helped Trump get elected, he would owe them big time (easing sanctions). But can that be proven, or considered collusion?

t3_6anlt1	t1_dhg1mhf	1494547950	Are you talking about Byrd?  Byrd was sick and missed about half of the votes from Oct 2009 to Mar 2010.  But he voted Yea for the ACA.  From Sept 2009 through Jan 2010 the Dems + caucusing Inds had 60 votes.   Further down in that article it says they got only 40 votes in the Senate to include the public option through reconciliation and Pelosi knew there was concern with the moderates in the House.    From [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/02/why-obama-dropped-the-public-option/346546/) about what killed the public option.   &gt;It Never Had Senate's Support:  Nate Silver says Obama didn't kill it because it was already dead. "In August, a whip count on the public option showed only 43 firm yes votes, one of which was Senator Kennedy," he writes. "And these totals reflected how Senators claim they would have voted if the public option were considered under regular order -- not under reconciliation, which is the process in play now. You might have to subtract some additional votes from among those Senators who are either opposed using reconciliation for health care in general, or opposed to including a public option in a reconciliation package specifically."   Lieberman may have put the nail in the coffin, but he wasn't he only one who killed it.     I support a public option.  I'm amazed and thankful that the ACA went as far as it did.  I think the path to a public option is by more states adopting it, like California is considering (I think).	unsureofwhatiwant	t1_dhfz4o6

You're just a garden variety shill with empty rhetoric.  Comey was the FBI Director, if you're presuming that means he has no influence -- wait for it -- IN THE FBI, then you're actually dense (We know this already). Provision of resources?

Remember a few weeks ago when Clinton blamed Comey?  Trump couldn't let that go so he bashed her *and* Comey.  Seems petty, yeah?  Right about Trump's level.   In Trump's mind, Comey made Trump look bad starting last year.  And when Comey said he was "a little nauseous" about affecting the election, of course Trump thought that comment was all about him.

I can tell you that if the primary had been open to independents in general, Bernie would have won in a landslide. I don't know on what basis democrats were reregistered as independents, but if it had anything to do with their voting history at all it almost certainly favoured Hillary, and if it was intentional election fraud it definitely favoured Hillary.   Given the global pattern of DNC bias, once again, at the very least you should be calling for an investigation before dismissing the possibility.	AnthropicSynchrotron	t1_dhftt80

t3_6agc58	t1_dhgjnm4	1494581513	&gt;I can tell you that if the primary had been open to independents in general, Bernie would have won in a landslide.   According to the analysis I've seen, Bernie did a little better in states with open primaries then closed primaries, but he still lost a majority of open primaries and still would have lost without the closed primaries.    In fact if all states were open primaries he actually would have lost by more since his biggest advantage was in caucuses.  &gt;Given the global pattern of DNC bias, once again, at the very least you should be calling for an investigation before dismissing the possibility.  Frankly, I think Bernie supporters spent a full year calling the DNC corrupt and claiming that primaries were rigged with no real evidence of either, and the result of telling voters that the Democrats were the real enemy was a catastrophic loss for the progressive cause, not just on the presidential level but on all levels of government.     Calling for "more investigations" now without any actual evidence of wrongdoing  just plays into Trump's conspiracy theories about voter rigging and damages our democracy further for no real reason.

t3_6aqhoz	t1_dhgku37	1494584936	&gt;Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered federal prosecutors late Thursday to pursue the toughest possible charges and sentences against crime suspects, reversing Obama administration efforts to ease penalties for some nonviolent drug violations.  &gt;“Long sentences for low-level, nonviolent drug offenses do not promote public safety, deterrence and rehabilitation,” Mr. Holder wrote in his 2013 memo, noting that in fact they exacerbate an expensive, overburdened prison system. The Obama administration, which led a bipartisan push for more lenient and flexible sentencing laws, presided over the first decline in the federal prison population in a generation.  &gt;“Prosecutors in the field appropriately pay attention to and try to follow the directions they receive from Washington,” he said. “A reversal or replacement of the Holder memo will be interpreted by many prosecutors in the field as a direction to be more aggressive to use mandatory minimum penalties against low-level nonviolent drug offenders.	sapplylapply	t3_6aqhoz
t3_6aqhoz	t1_dhgkxza	1494585226	I strongly disagree with this change. Heavy prosecution for non-violent drug crimes have an exponential effect on minorities which creates a cycle of prison and disfunctionality within society.  The "war on drugs" is a farce.	FN-guy	t3_6aqhoz

t3_6arpuk	t1_dhgvrpc	1494602118	Aside from the obvious contradiction here, there are two important lines of inquiry that the press needs to follow.  **1. Donald Trump the individual is separate and distinct from the entities that he owns.**  Therefore, if one of his companies, or one of its wholly or partially owned subsidiaries, receives income from Russian sources, his lawyer's claim would still be accurate in some technical sense.  Remember, his "business empire" (which is not really an empire at all -- Snapchat, which was founded a few years ago, is worth more) consists of scores of companies. And some of those own or co-own or receive income from other companies.   Trump has relied in the past on the legal separation between himself personally and these entities to circumvent disclosure requirements and mislead the public about his finances. For example, he failed to disclose hundreds of millions of dollars in debt (which was entirely legal) because the debt was held by a company in which he only owned a part interest, rather than a company he wholly owned. Very likely that his lawyer is relying on similar trickery here.   **2.  Income or investment sources could easily have flowed to Trump from Russian sources through intermediaries, which would make this statement technically true, even if he is in fact receiving money of Russian origin.**  Let's say Trump does a deal to build Trump Tower Moscow. And let's say that the developers behind the project set up a shell company (we'll call it DevCo) in the Netherlands or another tax haven to receive all the investment for the project and disburse the proceeds to investors and other financial participants.  And finally, let's say that instead of owning equity in the property, his income from the deal takes the form of royalties paid to the Trump Organization.  Even if DevCo is receiving investment or other income from Russian sources, then Trump can truthfully state *he's* not receiving income from Russian sources. He's receiving it from a Netherlands-based company. He doesn't even *own an interest in* a company that's receiving money from Russian sources.   By the way -- what I just laid out is an incredibly simple scenario. The way these kinds of projects are actually structured can be far more complex. But if even such a simple scenario gives his lawyer cover to make a misleading statement, you can only imagine how much deniability a more complex structure would create for him.  And I haven't even mentioned the possibility that Russian investors are funneling their loans or equity investment into his businesses through non-Russian companies (banks or businesses) that they own.	cheefjustice	t3_6arpuk

She alienated a large percentage of her base, which would have been trivially avoidable by making Bernie vice president. But of course she didn't need to because no one could possibly lose to Donald Trump, right?  Obviously fighting Trump is what's most important now, but sweeping the DNC bias under the carpet is not what's going to bring progressives back into the fold. I'm not sure why you're so insistent that there was no wrongdoing when the DNC has pretty much admitted that there was.   To quote Tom Perez himself,  “We heard loudly and clearly yesterday from Bernie supporters that the process was rigged, and it was. And you’ve got to be honest about it. That’s why we need a chair who is transparent.”  Said honesty is the path to unity. Unfortunately he walked that statement back later under pressure from Clinton partisans.   Anyway. I think I've pretty such said my peace. Hopefully 2018 works out.	AnthropicSynchrotron	t1_dhgjnm4

I think making Bernie VP would have alienated some moderates, and I think the VP choice she did make helped her win Virginia, which is key.  Hindsight is 20/20 of course.     Certainly in any losing campaign you can point to mistakes, and certainly Hillary made some.   But I think as voters and citizens we should try to focus more on issues and policies rather than political tactics; we've gotten too focused as a society on politics as a horse race, I think to our detriment.    And I don't want to give the impression that I'm happy with the performance of the DNC the past few years.    It's just that ultimately they don't really have that much influence or power anymore, and they certainly couldn't have run the kind of elaborate conspiracy some people have accused them of.   Mostly they just do fundraising and candidate recruitment.	Yosarian2	t1_dhgy6bt

Watching her on a panel also hurts, she has trouble keeping up with conversation because it always looks like she's waiting to plug a talking point. I have never watched anything by her and felt like I learned anything except how much Rachel Maddow doesn't like [thing].  This is just one man's opinion, though.

Marine Le Pen, by contrast, is almost refined. Trump posed a more visceral threat to democracy than she did — and yet the French immune system responded more effectively than the American one did.  &gt; The reason, at bottom, is that our own system has been deeply compromised by the slow-filtering poisons of political hatred.

During the general election, walking up to the polling building there was, standing at the required distance, a Democratic volunteer in a blue polyester pantsuit handing out sample ballots that were pre-filled straight ticket (D).  A portly fellow with a long, grey beard, a tucked in button down plaid shirt, blue jeans, and leather boots, got out of his pickup truck and was approaching the building several steps ahead of me and was approached first by the Democratic volunteer.

His entire case for firing Comey was gone in less than a day...  And here he is **saying it's okay to use mafia tactics on the nonpartisan head of the FBI**. This is astounding. He denies it, but then immediately undoes that by saying that he wanted Comey's loyalty - just to the country 'or something'.

For being disingenuous, yet it seems some of you think he was saying it was OK to ask for loyalty to himself.     The thing is, I'm pretty sure that's not what he said.

Grassley has not spoken to President Trump about what he has learned in briefings related to investigations into Russian interference in our elections, and he has never referred to the notion of collusion as a ‘hoax,’” Grassley’s spokesman, Taylor Foy, emailed Yahoo News.	buttbutt_fartfart	t3_6auyhe
t3_6auyhe	t1_dhhmfs2	1494634342	Because he's not. And now that he has openly admitted that Comey was fired because of the FBI's Russia investigation, he has put the crosshairs of obstruction squarely on his own forehead. He's such a numb nut.	morbidnate	t1_dhhmc8u

His eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., told attendees at a September 2008 real estate conference in New York that he’d been to Russia six times in the previous 18 months, with great success. He said:  "In terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia."  &gt; Eric Trump, the president’s middle son, told a Russian journalist in an undated interview (likely between 2005 and 2010) that “most of our buyers are foreign, among which there are very many Russians,” referring to the Trump Soho condos.	redd1t0r	t3_6avexb

I live in MD.  I make too much for the subsidies, but still not enough for a workable plan with other bills. 3 kids, house, utilities, car, etc.  Ended up for a while going with a Medicare plan through the state for the kids that I paid into, and no insurance for me and the wife.

t3_6aw70a	t1_dhhyr4s	1494655856	Those insurance plans had caps, yearly and life time caps.  After ACA they had become illegal to offer them.  So places like my employer, which is unionized and had workers then working 20 hours a week and getting that insurance, suddenly stopped getting insurance.   Edit:. Downvotes me if you want, I support ACA but these are the problems with it.  Cheap plans got eliminated and not replaced.  It's better to have a cheap bad plan than no plan because family obligations prevent you from working 30 hours a week.  People that should be voting Dem.	Lolboycunt	t1_dhhylz5

t3_6aw70a	t1_dhhyucz	1494656090	Provision? Not sure.  As I said, I moved companies because I was offered twice what I was getting paid.  Figured hey, better life for the family.  New company had shit insurance.  After asking around some of the long timers, they said it was better, but started going bad a couple of years after the ACA hit.  But I figured, living in MD, I could go to the exchange and find something.  Nope, because all their prices where high also.  People used to be able to afford insurance, now they have to choose between insurance or having a little bit of money.  Premiums may have slowed down under the ACA, but coverage has gone down, and deductibles have gone up because of it.  Some half assed single payer system that forces people to get fined when they choose not to buy something the government is selling, is not the way forward.

A small tax increase that would save me money for all the healthcare my family needs? Fuck yeah.  The main issues I have with it however, is that I don't think our government is capable of handling such an undertaking in an efficient manner.  Second point, is that I believe that since the US gives the most out of everyone to medical innovation, to take away money from the companies that drive innovation would stifle research.  Take away profits and spending money by the govt lowering prices through the leveraging power a single payer system would give it.	Mrredek	t1_dhhz0kv

At what point, in your mind, do politicians become responsible for the willful harm they inflict?  This woman's actions were wrong. That said, I have a hard time bringing myself to condemn her as some common criminal. Regardless, if things keep getting worse this sort of thing *will* become more common.

Are you in favor of politicians purposefully causing people to die or go bankrupt being part of the normal political process? Business as usual, no need to get mad, bro...it's just a political disagreement? The GOP sat down, wrote a bill *they all knew* was awful, that would devastate tens of thousands.

But if you are actually curious, I'd point you to overly strict voter ID laws, the expunging of hundreds of thousands of voters from city districts across the country, and gerrymandering in republican controlled states which surpassed population trends by a factor of 2-3 which has not been seen in our entire history as a nation.  The information is out there if you're willing to actually look for it. But according to your post history, I doubt you care to.	Ivedefected	t1_dhi0uyv

t3_6aw70a	t1_dhi34no	1494669705	Yeah, pretty obvious even from here. It just seems like such a fucked up system you have. Its hard to imagine anywhere that doesnt just have healthcare as a national service. For most of us its akin to not having free education for all. Or, probably more accurately, it is like privatising air and being glad to pay for it because that means that poor people cant have any.   From the outside it just makes US citizens and government look petty, selfish, self defeating and completely abnormal.	tehifi	t1_dhi1hse
t3_6aw70a	t1_dhi37bp	1494669961	The difference here is that there is no argument about when life starts. A thirty year old needing life saving healthcare is definitely alive.  An aborted baby doesn't have the sentience to be a victim. If they did, then maybe the abortion doctor murderers would be right. But they don't, so they're not.	mbelf	t1_dhhz97x

Trump has lived his life never having to face a consequence of his decision. Others had to, lawyers, staff thrown under the bus, others fired. But this is different.

If he secretly recorded conversations at Mar-A-Lago, he committed a [felony](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=&amp;URL=0900-0999/0934/Sections/0934.03.html).

t3_6awjbx	t1_dhihgul	1494697033	Oh, hello there. If you're not trolling and actually curious then you should take a look at how effectively republicans actually have gerrymandering lately. That, on top of the voter ID stuff, comes in handy. The issue with voter ID isn't that people have to show it, it's the way it's implemented. Many states end up moving dmv's around or under funding them. People who get the run around and stupid shit by the dmv are usually minorities as well.   There was just a recent article the other day about how Wisconsin quite possibly lost out on 200,000 votes that were more than likely democratic votes; however, it still needs to be peer reviewed and was a study done by a progressive think tank, so take it with a grain of salt.    Still, the report was intriguing given that most states that didn't impose strict voter ID laws actually had an average of 1.7% increase in turnout while the strict ones had like a 3% decrease. On top of that, something that many people tend to over look, we have tons of minorities being put in jail over minor drug charges. When coming out, many states actually will still not let them vote or they have to go through complicated paper work and spend money just so that they'll gain that ability again. In many of those cases they may also have to get a new ID when they don't have a job or any money.   If you check some articles on voter ID laws there's a good cost to obtaining them that many people over look because we're a bit more well off. As someone that considers themselves independent but progressive, I have no problems with voter ID as long as it's implemented correctly and it's made easy for people to vote. There shouldn't be any hurdles to voting. In fact, I think we should just have a free federally issued ID that'll take care of everything. State IDs are stupid. A guy in Wisconsin couldn't vote because he had moved and still had his old ID.   It's not supposed to be like that. Plus, with the Russia stuff happening there's been speculation that Republicans and Russians had a datamine of individuals information, including Facebook pages, which helped spread propaganda.   And I don't know you in particular, but I'm black and there are people right now who I grew up with that think we're out to get white males. They thought Obama, a constitutional law teacher at Harvard and our president, was telling people that were not citizens that they could vote. They think moving the Jefferson Davis statue is an attack and a erasure of history. They even believed that the statue stuff was something that came up only in the last few months when it was voted on in December of 2015, 6 months after the Dylan Roof stuff. Not only that, but they didn't even know that the people decided they wanted to find a proper place for it, which very well could be a museum thus not erasing history.   I assume all of you to be good people. Like I said, I grew up with people that will say the same things some people at T_D would say. I've talked to them. If we ever hang out everything's all good. We're all good people, but the scary thing is that good people don't really stop bad things from happening. It's hard trying to keep up with stuff. I can't keep up with everything Limbaugh or AJ says. I can't comment on every thread trying to make people understand we're not out to get you, but it's deeply troubling for me to see this stuff happening.   Discussions are looked at like people are looking down on you or that they're trying to shut you up. People are boiling things down to "offenses" and not trying to understand each other. That's a problem. I grew up in the south, I have no problem with people having confederate memorabilia. Some of my best friends have that stuff, but I feel like we should all be able to agree that it shouldn't be on government buildings and we shouldn't have statues romanticizing that stuff. Especially if the statues were commissioned in the Redemption Era of the South. I feel like we should all be able to agree that, even though those ancestors might not have owned slaves, slavery was a key issue to the war. I feel like we should be able to talk about racism during that time and after it, but people feel like we're calling them racists.   I'm not calling you racist. I'm just trying to look out for myself and my family. I feel like everyone can understand that.	Koozzie	t1_dhidlzu

I do know that a lot of people move to Newfoundland specifically because it's somehow easier to go through the process here (then move somewhere where with better job opportunities). I really can't speak to the process other than I've helped a few of my employees with some of the references they need. It does take a few years for sure and there is a ton of paperwork.   As for the professionals working retail jobs etc. That really depends on what area of the country you live in. That's certainly true in some areas but there are other places where it's not the case.

t3_6azt46	t1_dhinvzq	1494706224	I implore you to read #gamergate revolt's infamous Titan Post. https://archive.is/FO655  -- ([read aloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmtmyzeVcLw))  &gt;He didn’t monetize his videos and he deletes his channel regularly, meaning he only wants to be judged by the merit of his output. This moment he attempts to make gains for his ego, he becomes a force that harms rather than heals. His **regular deletion and adoption of a new identity** shows that he is wise to everything I’ve written so far, barring the chance he adopted this strategy by chance.  **Counter-strategy 3: Anonymity**  The best way to deal with ego is through anonymity. You may not realize it immediately but we are all our own worst enemies. It is human nature to feel the need to be acknowledged by others, but it is a pitiful desire that was sought after by tyrants throughout the centuries and passed down as bait for the masses. The majority of people will die without being acknowledged. Some go for religion in order to be acknowledged by a supreme deity, others attempt to etch their names in history with other people’s blood and some even had hoped to live for eternity at whatever cost available to them. In time, all will wash out in the dust, your life is what you make of it yourself, your will and your time are not limitless. Knowing alone that your will was carried out and those who have similar wills have carried it alongside you should be comfort enough to keep you going. Be more selfless and care for the only thing that matter outside your will: your progeny and your loved ones. These are the only potentially eternal extension of your will.  Anyway, back in reality, anonymity is a double edged sword: On the one hand, you do not know who the other person, or what their intentions are. On the other hand, knowing this alone allows you to **form no-lose strategies**. Formulate tactics alone, and release them in such a way that it will attract the majority of anonymous poster’s attention who can act on it immediately, before the enemy anons can formulate a counter-narrative to stop you from gaining ground. In previous boards, people would shout “stampede” at a good strategy in order to get others to stop. Always ignore flat out naysayers (who give no good reasons for their dissent) until you’ve formed your own opinion of the idea proposed, even if it takes you time to do so. Don’t passively read a thread, think and then participate if you see not enough anons have made the correct conclusion. On the other hand, be wary of false flaggers who wish you to commit a tactical error in the face of the enemy.  Keep a degree of separation from your fellow revolters, avoid meet ups, which killed previous attempts such as Chanology, turning them into an ego fests. You can all meet up after victory is achieved, even if that is decades down the line. You can communicate in a secure fashion online. Why compromise your identity and be forced to mince your words?  The separation also counts for the board owners and volunteers. The moment you form a clique with cells which should act as a check for others, you compromise anonymity effectively, as each person will hold a personal value to you. This means avoid forming IRC channels for janitorial purposes. The current anon board owner understands this, but it is important to understand his reasons so I’ve laid them out here.  Finally, the enemy knows the power of anonymity and he is actively fighting it. Whether they pass data collection, anti-encryption or “harassment” laws, they do so with the intent of de-anonymizing the internet and holding everyone accountable to every word they utter in opposition to the establishment and their sacred cows. This is a battle you must not lose sight of, as it is linked to GamerGate in a intimate way. You see, the entire thing was started as a false flag and not in the year you all assume. It began in 2013. [11] I will leave the diggers to figure it out from that point as it is a can of worms I unfortunately have no time to open.	JamesCommieBTFO	t1_dhinj1o

t3_6b0lxh	t1_dhiupny	1494716175	No. The tie goes to the voters in 2018: Did Trump commit an impeachable offense? No one cares what Dershowitz thinks.  He's not talking Constitution. His point is irrelevant.    This addresses high crimes and misdemeanors and ethics which give  rise to impeachment:  &gt;Prof. Tribe, in a televised interview, emphasized several aspects of the swirling controversy: first, unnamed “associates” of Mr. Comey reportedly have said that Pres. Trump had asked then-director Comey if he could count on his “loyalty,” and Comey had not given an affirmative answer.  &gt;In that larger context, Prof. Tribe believes that asking for Comey’s “loyalty” is the equivalent of asking for a promise that Trump will not become a target of the investigation. That, according to Prof. Tribe, is an “impermissible” request, which “on its face” is an obstruction of justice.   This would be about statutory criminal law only instead, its a distracted fallacy.  &gt;Dershowitz: He thinks that the idea that Pres. Trump is guilty of obstructing justice is “a dangerous argument…being put forward by some Democratic ideologues[.]” (I told you the faculty lounge at Harvard Law was tense, didn’t I?)   Calling the argument 'dangerous' and its propoents 'ideologues' aside from being silly and irrelevant, is not about the topic but about the debaters, the well known fallacy 'argumentum ad hominem.'

t3_6b0pnn	t1_dhixg94	1494720317	So far. But also remember, it's up to the committee to find the evidence without the help of the FBI. No leads. No interviews. No evidence. FBI won't tell them anything since it's ongoing.  And this is why people are so upset about Comey being out. The Republican lead committees could keep spinning their wheels, but people knew the FBI was there to do the job seriously. Special Prosecutor would have been great, but Comey really filled that role for Democrats. They knew from the Clinton Email ordeal he was serious business.

Group of former and active members. They apparently sent out an email to the group. But the time frame of this isn't specific. How many active agents responded is not clear. But it is important to note that this isn't an FBI endorsement. It's an FBI *group* some outlets are conflating the two. *My knee jerk reaction is the timing is off. If they're going to endorse someone, why was it today, when trump asked to hurry up the search. It sounds like they sent an email today and the results are in already which is weird. Also he's chairman of the group so, I don't really buy this group's endorsement*	starslookv_different	t3_6b0m1g

He can make a vague implication that really says nothing, and his supporters will spin it into a story to meet their master's needs. They infer, correctly, that Trump is winking to them and telling them to "Go spread around fake news that Trump has the goods on Comey, and make up some really great material to put in there for me."    God, I HATE his supporters.  Never met one that was not an ignorant, superstitious asshole.  I really have not.  Until Trump came along, I had a policy, self-designed and imposed,  to avoid hating anyone, ever.

None of them are ready to risk their influence in the party or their public image, save for a few NeverTrumpers, but I can guarantee the ones without blood on their hands are going to be working feverishly against Trump, because at this point he's toxic and cancerous for both parties, as well as America on the whole.	ninemiletree	t1_dhj6s7t

Graham has created a tax return bill and a bill form congress to review sanctions before the president does anything. Cardin and McCain had their hard hitting sanctions bill, and Waters has her hilarious No REX act that basically abuts and enhances Graham's bill (likely by design.)  These bills serve three purposes: their stated functions, great campaign material, and third to see how their fellow senators and reps respond. Who objects/throws up road blocks/how they vote.  Waters and Graham are goofy, over the top, and loud at times, but they aren't stupid. They know what they're doing.

Try to undo as much of the damage and harm that he was able to cause. And focus on  education reform and bringing his sect of followers back into the fold of democracy.

White House staffers provided him a transcript of the recording. But aides often record interviews by government officials, and a former senior Obama White House official said there was no secret taping system in place, and that a stenographer always recorded meetings with journalists. “None of that was hidden—the stenographer sat in interviews with a tape recorder and sometimes even a boom mic,” the official said. “This was just so we had a transcript of interviews Obama did and, again, would have been known to any journalist who interviewed Obama. We didn’t record private meetings.”](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/if-there-are-white-house-recordings-they-could-be-subpoeanaed/526632/)	AMReese	t1_dhjh87d

So not some hidden microphone, didn't know he was being recorded situation.  &gt;Update: A former official with the Obama White House contacted The Post to incdicate that the transcript provided by Rhodes came from a stenographer in the room during the interview. He added that the Obama administration did not secretly record private meetings.

There was a stenographer in the room with President Obama and the reporter who made the recording and provided the transcript when the reporter's tape recorder died.

t3_6b2wog	t1_dhjtmft	1494783912	&gt; no, class politics would recognize that poor blacks, poor whites, poor latinos and so on have more in common between them that with their rich counter part.   In the same way that black people can recognize that they have similar interests to other black people. It is the exact same mechanic, you're just saying it isn't because your fine with workers banding together and not racial minorities.    &gt; identity politics would tell you that rich blacks and poor blacks have more in common than poor blacks and poor whites...if you focus on the identity then their economic power or cultural level disappear and is just one big collective base on race,gender, ethnicity and so on.   1. Class is identity, there are plenty of working class people who don't identify as working class and vote for fiscally conservative politicians because they identify as middle class.   2. Identities are not mutually exclusive, someone realizing that they are gay does not make them any less white.    &gt; nope, is traditional politics which is appealing to religious groups been christians or Jews, also to people who prefer less government like libertarians   1. Where do those traditions come from? Atheism? No, these people have a problem with gays and abortion because of their religion.   2. Since when is getting the government involved in people's sex lives considered less government?    &gt; during the campaign he promote gay recognition in front of a massive crowd of voters as well as his moment with the lgbt flag...so your GOP stereotype is old.   1. Donald Trump invited Tony Perkins, the president of the [Family Research Council](http://www.frc.org/homosexuality) which has been listed as an anti-LGBT hate group since 2010, to speak about Christian politics at the RNC. This is a man who has said that gay people ["are intolerant. They are hateful. They are vile. They are spiteful."](https://www.glaad.org/cap/tony-perkins)   2. Donald Trump has signed executive orders that roll back protections for the LGBT community.   3. [The overwhelming majority of Republicans still oppose LGBT rights.](http://www.pewforum.org/2016/05/12/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/)   4. Donald Trump waving a flag does not negate the first three points.   5. Donald Trump's voters being ignorant about his actions does not negate the first three points.   &gt; identity politics can be use to anything but it foster the division of pushing the interest of a group over another, the end result if multiple competing groups, the ultimate divide and conquer which create the current polarization.   Yes if we're talking about the identity politics of the right in America, identity politics has certainly led to division and violence in this country. When the GOP tries to get cheap votes from Christians by telling them that the LGBT community is going to molest their kids that corrodes our national unity. When the GOP tries to get cheap votes from white people by telling them that people of color are going to get high and rape them that only increases unrest.   If we're talking about the identity politics of the left in America, it has had a largely positive effect. Without getting poor people to band together to fight for better working conditions the New Deal could have never been past. Without getting people of color to band together to fight for their rights the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act would have never been past. Without getting LGBT people to band together to fight for marriage and civil rights, gay marriage would still be illegal right now. Without getting women to band together to fight for equal rights abortion would still be illegal and women still wouldn't be allowed to vote. People can make no progress unless they build political coalitions that represent them and people like them.	HighAndOnline	t1_dhjgq6k

t3_6b5wgx	t1_dhk09va	1494792692	Fair enough- I didn't know he was charitable. I just know he was another person (like McCain, ironically) who was publicly insulted by Trump and then still supported him.	GeorgeBluthisTrump	t1_dhk027b
t3_6b5wgx	t1_dhk0gvs	1494792926	He never supported him publicly, he interviewed for The Sec of State position. I think he was thinking he could have influence on Trump from the inside. He actually slammed him in a speech calling him a fraud and other things. Wish I could post the YouTube video on here. There was so much news coming out about the election hard to keep track though. I'm a huge Romney fan, so forgive me if I rant lol.	TheGame81677	t1_dhk09va
t3_6b5wgx	t1_dhk0jv2	1494793025	Had to find [this](http://www.newsweek.com/american-sanctions-russia-wont-be-lifted-until-crimea-returned-ukraine-says-588849) little nugget on /r/worldnews because it challenges the popular Trump/Russia narrative that has consumed this sub. Also, some other headlines from today are showing that he said he wouldn't compromise his positions for Trump. I don't think that Tillerson is any kind of hero or deserves to be in the position he's in but it's interesting to watch our current foreign policy take the shape of every other administration's while the throngs below fight over the unprecedented danger of this cabinet.	MysticRay	t3_6b5wgx
t3_6b5wgx	t1_dhk0l3y	1494793067	Tillerson is a doofus. We can't reset but we can reengage. Oh, okay.  This seems to be his rhetorical style....hair-splitting and insubstantial verbosity. Spends a lot of time very carefully saying nothing.	seeking_horizon	t3_6b5wgx
t3_6b5wgx	t1_dhk0ncl	1494793139	Despite his words, Tillerson's (and the administration's) actions re: Russia are those of attempting to reset relations through maximum capitulation. No criticism ever. No condemnation of their human rights violations, or their authoritarian grasp over their own "democratic" processes. Make sure we don't accidentally bomb them while bombing their allies. Release a statement about NK from the Russian perspective. Invite Lavarov and Kislyak in to the OO with their state-run press but not our free media. And no sanctions or punishment for violating our electoral process. Tillerson may be invoking the principle of irreversibility in communications, and that's all good and fine, but we've seen for months now that they are in Putin's pocket.  So that begs the question that none of these press monkeys seem to want to ask the administration:  What exactly does better relations with Russia, entirely on *Putin's* terms, gain for us as Americans?	watthefucksalommy	t3_6b5wgx
t3_6b5wgx	t1_dhk0t5a	1494793329	I wouldn't assume Tillerson is in anyway, solely, trying to help Russia.  It's about business and oil for him.  The Russian's may have wanted Trump to appoint him to facilitate the arctic drilling deals but ultimately he's going to look out for his own, or Exxon's interests.  It could very well be that the Kremlin is cooling their opinions of him for not helping enough. So, I would expect them to begin to criticize  him publicly and on these boards.	3rdred	t1_dhk0jv2
t3_6b5wgx	t1_dhk11ud	1494793627	Romney did not support him  He did go in and talk to Trump about being SoS.  When the President-elect calls, you generally answer the phone.  It was not Romney's fault that Trump just set him up as part of the dog and pony show.  (Trump later stated he knew exactly who is SoS was going to be, so bringing in Romney was just to embarrass him).	isikorsky	t1_dhk09va
t3_6b5wgx	t1_dhk16l7	1494793791	Good points. Tillerson may very well be speaking on behalf of Exxon's interests and that just happens to coincide with standard US diplomatic policy. Still, this puts Putin's stronghold over our administration into question and I think that's why a lot of this is getting buried.	MysticRay	t1_dhk0t5a

t3_6b6bsg	t1_dhk40el	1494797212	So the FBI is loyal to the FBI. Which can cause problems when they decide to do something awful, but is good when they decide to do something like continue to investigate the president when Congress is trying to slow walk it and the president is trying to shut it down. I mean, really, the FBI should not be so heavily tied the the executive branch, IMHO, but at the moment I feel like this is something which isn't going to be solved any time soon.

Tridamos	t1_dhk3tdr
t3_6b6bsg	t1_dhk452k	1494797368	The lackeys are all career officers, and I'm talking all the departments, but particularly State and Justice.

t3_6b5hmz	t1_dhk495u	1494797500	I can dig up plenty other quotes that had me raise my eyebrows in this respect:  &gt;I was flummoxed by his argument, a more thoughtful Nietzschean critique than I was prepared to take on—and by the unnerving fact that the kid who’d once cribbed my chemistry notes now had something to say.   ...  &gt; I remember little to admire and little to despise—other than, perhaps, the featureless mediocrity he represented to my ambitious teenage self.  He also likes using words such as polymathic, which to be honest, I think most of us will have to google to know what it really means. But perhaps that's just me not being a native English speaker.  If it was subtle self-mockery, it is that of someone who does indeed consider himself to be intellectually superior and loves to showcase how incredibly well read he is, hence my /r/Imverysmart comment. It just makes for an annoying read in my opinion, even though I agree with his subject matter.   But hey, to each our own.	H0agh	t1_dhk3tgj

You can't just remove the statues that actually are bad people, you must remove all statues pertaining to the south's treason against the Union. They aren't destroying the statue, it would make a great addition to Arlington, but the people of the area are using it as a symbol to mean "Hate."

This was just so we had a transcript of interviews Obama did and, again, would have been known to any journalist who interviewed Obama.  Unless Mark Bowden says otherwise, there was a stenographer there. He never said that the interview was conducted in private, or that he had a full view of his surroundings.

t3_6b1nfw	t1_dhkdoq0	1494810182	&gt;Unless Mark Bowden says otherwise, there was a stenographer there.   I agree, as it is pretty obvious that there was someone or something recording after the fact. So now the issue is, did Obama record meetings without people's knowledge? In secrecy? Did they tell Bowden they would also record the meeting? It doesn't matter if a group of people are there or not, because you are under the impression that Obama is not having the meeting recorded.  Lets just get this straight: No meeting with the president is ever in private. Especially when it is with the head of the FBI. That is like asking a police officer for a private meeting to discuss illegal activity and expect the officer not to arrest you after confessing to a crime committed or wanting to commit. "But it was in private!@#" defense will not work when brought to court, right?  So I have shown, yes, Obama did have his meetings recorded without the other party's knowledge. In fact, every past president since Nixon has recorded their conversations/meetings with or without the other party's knowledge. You and others are just upset because it is Trump who is recording now.  Were you this upset when you learned that Obama had the entire US's phone calls secretly recorded? If not, why?	facestabber	t1_dhkaabq

t3_6b1nfw	t1_dhkee2s	1494811181	Hey, looks like you have a short-term memory problem. Here is the same paragraph once again.  &gt;(Phillip) Bump also cites an account by my colleague Mark Bowden, who had a recorder fail while interviewing Barack Obama. White House staffers provided him a transcript of the recording. But aides often record interviews by government officials, and a former senior Obama White House official said there was no secret taping system in place, and that a stenographer always recorded meetings with journalists. “None of that was hidden—the stenographer sat in interviews with a tape recorder and sometimes even a boom mic,” the official said. “This was just so we had a transcript of interviews Obama did and, again, would have been known to any journalist who interviewed Obama. We didn’t record private meetings.”  Notice how it explains why they had a stenographer, and how the practice is common when granting interviews to the media? Must have slipped your mind.  &gt;Lets just get this straight: No meeting with the president is ever in private.  Well, yeah, I'd assume the Secret Service would need to be around.  &gt;So I have shown, yes, Obama did have his meetings recorded without the other party's knowledge.  You showed something you couldn't back up with evidence, yes. Mark Bowden never said either way that he was unaware that he was being recorded.  &gt;In fact, every past president since Nixon has recorded their conversations/meetings with or without the other party's knowledge.  Ford, Carter, Bush Sr., and Clinton never secretly recorded conversations in the White House, namely because of what happened to Nixon. So, you are actually very, very wrong.  &gt;You and others are just upset because it is Trump who is recording now.  No, we're upset that he's trying to use them as a threat against Comey. Reagan did do a lot of recording, but he never used it as a weapon. The same could not be said of Trump.  &gt;Were you this upset when you learned that Obama had the entire US's phone calls secretly recorded? If not, why?  Except, you know, he didn't. If you actually look at what happened, James Clapper and the CIA's goal was recording foreign targets. The problem was that they inadvertently also recorded conversations between those targets and the US citizens that they were calling, not unlike how they caught Flynn.  So, no, I was not upset.

If that is not enough evidence, then I cant think of anything other than you being there that would be sufficient enough for you.  The transcripts weren't for him, and it wasn't meant to be a private conversation, so it doesn't really matter. Their conversation was recorded because Bowden was with the media and archiving such things is important. You can try to read into what was said or not all you want, but until you find me Bowden saying whether or not he knew he was being recorded, rather than just go with, "Well, he didn't say this", then there's nothing more to talk about.  &gt;You seem like do you not want to hear what is on the tapes.  What makes you think that? If Comey goes down, then that's fine. No big loss. If he brings down Trump with him, that's even better.  &gt;If Trump has something on Comey, then why not threaten him?  Well, according to the letter sent by Reps. Elijah Cummings and John Conyers Jr., “it is a crime to intimidate or threaten any potential witness with the intent to influence, delay or prevent their official testimony.” So, you know, that whole thing.  &gt;If anything, you should be mad at Trump for NOT releasing the tapes and only using it as a personal weapon.   I don't even believe any tapes exist. When it comes to Trump, he bullshits way too much and has made way too many wild claims for me to just believe that those exist.  &gt;Why are you defending Comey if someone has dirt on him? Get rid of the corrupt trash that controls our lives and ruins our happiness in life.  Comey isn't the corrupt one here. Trump was the one that abused his power.  &gt;HOW ARE YOU THIS NAIVE. The "targets" were the only ones they investigated.  And who did they investigate? Foreign targets. That's what the whole operation was about. They collected incidental data of the US citizens who were involved in the calls. James Clapper said as much.   &gt;If you don't think your calls weren't apart of a database, I got a bridge for to buy at a very great price.

t3_6b8bf8	t1_dhkpo0v	1494831574	I'm not a Trump supporter, but you greatly overstate Trump's negative traits.  Just because he's likely to double deal or screw over people, doesn't mean he doesn't understand the differences and/or the advantages of talking over sending people to fight and die in a war.  He may not be the ideal person for the job, but he's not by himself.  Wouldn't it make more sense to hope he at least attempts diplomacy?  He's likely to outsource the hard part of that job to his underlings anyway and the North Koreans are anxious for a peace deal, especially now that South Korea has a new president that's a fan of the "Sunshine Policy".

t3_6b2wog	t1_dhkq87y	1494833061	&gt;In the same way that black people can recognize that they have similar interests to other black people.  on the abstract, on practice right blacks have different interest than poor blacks...class politics does not take race into consideration, what is beneficial for the poor will be beneficial for poor blacks, poor whites, poor asians, poor africans and so on...but if you made polices for poor blacks then the other groups are left out of those benefits.  &gt;Identities are not mutually exclusive, someone realizing that they are gay does not make them any less white.  politics that affects whites will also affect white gays but politics that affect gays wont affect the non-gay whites...if you create group base rights then you are creating special rights that certain people wont have.  &gt;Where do those traditions come from? Atheism?  in some places it does, socialist nations discriminated gays on the idea that they wouldn't generate descendants and wouldn't contribute to the continuity of the society, you don't need religion to discriminate people.  &gt;Since when is getting the government involved in people's sex lives considered less government?  it isn't but the government provide social assistance for families, is the whole point of civil marriage, is a contract with the state.  &gt;Donald Trump invited Tony Perkins  and also peter thiel...the principle of toleration means working with both.  &gt; roll back protections for the LGBT community.  hobby lobby, that debacle should show you that LGBT are no longer special but equal, now is time to face that life is hard.  &gt;The overwhelming majority of Republicans still oppose LGBT rights.  and accepted that same-sex marriage is the law, tolerance is all you can get from other people.  &gt;Donald Trump waving a flag does not negate the first three points.  but it shows they are not irrational ideologues and can find common cause with everyone, in this case been American.  &gt;Donald Trump's voters being ignorant about his actions does not negate the first three points.  about what actions?  &gt;When the GOP tries to get cheap votes from Christians by telling them that the LGBT community  and then you have the candidate for the presidency celebrating his gay supporters and the republican voters find common cause during the campaign. it does negate your point.  &gt;people of color are going to get high and rape  and you will have to explain that people of color like every other people are not better humans that do no wrong...there are mexican cartels and salvadorean gangs, there are massive levels of crime in poor areas this cant be ignored.  &gt;Without getting poor people to band together to fight  identity politics does not get "poor people to band together" since there are multiple identities withing the "poor people" what you get is poor blacks pulling for their side and poor latinos pulling for their side and poor whites poling for their side...  &gt;Without getting women to band together   maybe you have notice that now we have "white feminism" and "black feminism" and "black women wage gap and latina women wage gab and white women wage gap and muslim women and women that oppose abortion...there is no band together they are competing withing themselves.  &gt;they build political coalitions   you cant build a political coalition if you see the other groups as your enemies, more latino immigration means less jobs for uneducated blacks, removing affirmative action is beneficial to jews and asians but affect africans and hindus...that is the point of making class base politics, poor people of whatever identity will have common interest.

The DNC is better then the GOP but the current DNC is still too far right and very disconnected from any American not in an urban/suburban area.

The Trump administration is actively trying to destroy every single government institution, they are ripping apart education, healthcare and the environment and every single member of the republican congress is pushing the same agenda.   It's clear trump has colluded with Russia and is acting to further Russian interests and inrich himself and his family at the cost of everyone else and every single member of the republican congress is protecting him so they can push their own agenda of tearing the government apart.  The only thing between the US falling is the democrats. Look at how the DNC were able to stop the monstrosity of a healthcare act whilst being the minority party. Look at the questions asked my members of the DNC at the confirmation hearings, at open intelligence committee hearings. Look at the actual voting records. Open your damn eyes and look. They are not the same.   When your choice is between the antithesis of everything you believe in and someone with 80% of the same agenda as you because the other 20% isn't politically feasible.

t3_6b9grp	t1_dhkuli0	1494846248	That's how the election system works. You will not be able to hold elections until 2018 and even then best case scenario you flip the house in a wave election and pick up 3 senators to flip the senate to a simple majority. (More likely to flip the house than the senate but even then it would take a double digit points swing across the board to do that, which means dems have to break tradition this time round and actually vote in a mid term election)  As it currently stands, you will not get a republican congress to impeach trump and you certainly won't get them to hold a special election. Best case scenario evidence comes out that is so incriminating his base turns (extremely unlikely) that the republicans have no choice but to impeach him or face a political backlash. But for now if any one breaks the party line they are likely to lose their seat in the next election due to aggressive funding against them and an angry base still loyal to trump.  No need to day dream, hold tight, stay angry and active and continue to keep peers aware of what's going on and make sure they vote in 2018.	jaywastaken	t1_dhkuavy

t3_6bacnt	t1_dhkzkwa	1494855709	The "Trump haters" as she so eloquently puts it are people who simply ascertained Trump lacks the skills, experience, temper and background to be running anything at all. It wasn't that hard to figure out. Nobody thought he was sane and every economist on the planet told us his policies were bunk.  Many conservatives also realized this but sadly enough of them didn't care and simply wanted a win. That's the problem with American politics - it's a partisan sport.   You don't "win" just because the team you identified with does. You win when your community, society, and country prosper. That's not possible under a Trump/extreme-right presidency. I don't say that because I have any person bias against the man it's simply a matter of looking at his policy platform and evaluating his intellect and emotional state.  That's the difference between a real progressive and a real conservative. A real progressive wants things to be better and at the end of the day doesn't care which 'team' gets that done. The best policy package should always win.	CatalyticDragon	t3_6bacnt

t3_6b9grp	t1_dhl3zrh	1494861467	Not speaking as a representative for democrats, but I'd argue that:  1. Healthcare reform. Amend the ACA to include a single payer option, against which insurance companies can compete.  2. Environmental protection. Officially recognize man made climate change as an existential threat to Americans and the world. Severely limit carbon emissions. Fund the bajeezus out of clean energy technologies. And put America back at the forefront of this emerging market.  3. Pass a decent infrastructure bill. Get the damn roads and bridges fixed, and employ people while doing it.  4. Bust up internet service monopolies. Incentivize improving infrastructure and competition to provide Americans with the best internet possible.  5. Education reform. The disparity in service across different school districts, and even schools within the same district is shocking. It ought to be the right of every American to have access to excellent and safe public education. Likely this will also mean imposing restrictions on charter schools, and making teaching a much more attractive profession.   6. Election reform. People cannot feel as though candidates are being chosen for them by monied interests anymore.  7. Financial reform and regulation.   8. Student Loan relief. Want to get the millennials into the polls? Help them with the mountain of debt they are drowning in.   9. This one is a little unclear, but democrats simply have to have something to tell out of work miners and factory workers. What are they going to do to bring back jobs that these people want?  10. Tart it up however you like, but an increase in taxes for corporations and the ultra rich. Average Americans will stomach their own taxes much easier if they feel the elites are paying their fair share.	rattfink	t1_dhl0cv5

t3_6b9grp	t1_dhl7o87	1494865756	&gt; * Impeach Trump  I don't know if this should be your number one but sure top 10.   &gt; * Universal Healthcare  This probably should be your #2 priority (good job).  Problem is a large portion of the DNC have not joined the single payer bill currently available to them.  Hell some of them have said they don't want it, and it will never happen.  This needs to be a unified effort - which corporate democrats will not join.   &gt; * Combat Climate Change  This is probably the #3 priority (good job).  Some infighting about what coorporations to support for funds and how far we go - but overall this is something all Democrats rally behind.  Rather that government employees did it / managed it.   &gt; * Blue-Collar Job Training for Emerging Industries  Vague - but yes.  But probably not #4.   &gt; * Employee and Consumer Protections  This should be in the top 5 (good job).  Fix the FCC shit going on.  Fix the ISP shit that just passed.  Included in this would be protection from banks etc.  But half of the DNC are opposed to this kind of stuff.  &gt; * Campaign Finance Reform  This is your #1 thing to fight republicans on.  Make large donations impossible, make it so super pacs are not a thing.  But again half of the current representatives don't want to change this.  90% of the American people support this.  &gt; * Equal LGBTQ Rights  How much more equal can this get?  They can get married, have the same benefits - how much more "equal" can this go?  Just curious what rights are being oppressed on the national level - and sure fix those for equality - but remember equal means equal. 1 = 1.  Not 1.25 = 1.  Just don't make laws that restrict personal freedoms in general.  &gt; * Universal Secondary Education  Worthy of the top 5 that's for sure.  Most Democrats would rally behind this.   &gt; * Wall Street Reform  Again this should be a top 5 if possible.  But half of the current reps - don't want this.   &gt; * Progressive Tax Reform  The leaders of the DNC do not want to change this.  In the end  Impeachment, Climate Change, some Consumer protections (living wage maybe?) and perhaps Secondary education can pass with the current DNC.  (LGBTQ and Job Training already passed)  But if we continue to follow the current leaders  Healthcare, Finance Reform, Wallstreet Reform, and Progressive Tax reforms - will never happen with the current DNC.  Two of those are home runs - Finance and Healthcare reform...	Pewpewlazor5	t1_dhl6dmt

t3_6bb3ze	t1_dhlbr65	1494870376	&gt; We are not intended to be a military dictatorship.  It's not like like that either, but it's certainly worrisome. It could mean Trump is so full of self-doubt, he doesn't even trust himself with having the choice in critical situations, much less having to come up with a decision.    You have to wonder what is happening in the WH right now?	JackTFarmer	t1_dhl6au4
t3_6b9grp	t1_dhlc4nw	1494870796	Honestly this is the worst advice.  Republicans have been playing far dirtier and that is why they are winning.  You literally said it in your own post.  "Trump vs anti Trump" sells the most, so focus on that and beat them at their own game.  Look at what happened with Hillary, regardless of all the things she has better than Trump (actual plans for tax, healthcare, education, environment), she still got beat because they focused too much on Benghazi and emails.  Everyone already comes in thinking politicians are competent.  You saying your plans etc will look the same as the most saying their plans; the common person doesn't understand differences between them so they vote what they always voted.  If you make the other person look like shit though, you win.  It is not about getting votes for yourself, it is about stealing votes from the other person.	inventionnerd	t1_dhl3nwv
t3_6bb3ze	t1_dhlcxd3	1494871686	It's not self-doubt.  Trump simply finds the job too tedious to be bothered with it.  Fox and Friends are in and they might say his name after all.	JDogg126	t1_dhlbr65
t3_6b9grp	t1_dhldr4l	1494872615	&gt; "Trump vs anti Trump" sells the most, so focus on that and beat them at their own game.  It may sell the most papers, but it doesn't win the most votes. It makes the whole election about Trump and lets Trump continue to control and manipulate the news cycle. His policies are garbage, but he and his campaign knew how to play the media like a fiddle last year. When the conversation is only about Trump, he seems like a more viable candidate than he really is.  &gt; Look at what happened with Hillary, regardless of all the things she has better than Trump (actual plans for tax, healthcare, education, environment), she still got beat because they focused too much on Benghazi and emails.  I'd also point to how Hillary was covered in this regard. Hillary would make a 30 minute articulate policy speech and 1 remark about Trump's lack of qualification and every news outlet would cover it as "Hillary attacks Trump over qualifications!" And then the Hillary campaign would see this and think "When we attack Trump, we get news coverage" and start doing it more. And the news cycle devolved into a conversation about Trump rather than policy every damn time.  Democrats have policies supported by a majority of Americans. Republicans don't. We need to make the conversation about that and let Trump speak for himself. The conversation needs to be about the future of America, not about Trump.	DubiousCosmos	t1_dhlc4nw
t3_6bb3ze	t1_dhlduta	1494872728	Delve.   I've read a bunch of old articles about him and watched his interviews. He's a badass through and through, but he's well read and he values intelligence and study more than you'd think.  He doesn't just give orders, he assigns required reading, so that everyone serving under him has a grasp for the geopolitics and history of the area they'll be entering.  He also values diplomacy - he said something recently about cuts in the State dept. Essentially the quote was "If you're going to cut spending in the State dept, we'll need to spend a lot more on bullets."  It seems like he's more than willing to follow orders and kill the shit out of an enemy - he (rightly, I think) believes that a war isn't over when you say it is, it's over when the enemy says it's over, or is completely eradicated.  If he is the only person calling the shots on foreign policy we're in okay hands. Not great hands, because he's not a diplomat. But we won't have the kind of schizophrenic wars we do now, because he won't be responding to partisan pressure to double down or back down for a win at the polls.	Mitt_Romney_USA	t1_dhlb26g

t3_6bb3ze	t1_dhle3px	1494873002	I agree, but until that policy is official I don't think we have much to worry about. If Trump leaves things in such a state that a new POTUS can come in and take the CiC role that other Presidents have honored, I highly doubt that Mattis or any general would balk at taking orders and following the President's lead.  I actually feel bad for Mattis, because he didn't ask to have the responsibility he's shouldering, and he knows enough history to understand why civilian control of the Military is important.

I don't blame him for wanting to engage Iran either - I mean it's no secret that Iran is funding terrorists around the globe. From his perspective as the guy in charge of the war on terrorism in the MENA region, it was probably like playing Whack-A-Mole.

t3_6b9grp	t1_dhlitxk	1494878335	- Emoulments Clause, Obstruction of Justice, FCPA, Unpaid Parking Tickets, Jaywalking - doesn't really matter what the crime is, because you can really impeach a President for nothing at all. Think of it as less of a criminal proceeding and more of a vote of no confidence. - We've had a free market healthcare system. It doesn't work. Universal healthcare has it's ups and downs, and is better than what we have now or have had in the past. - Domestic green energy production is a national security issue: it guarantees US energy independence, deprives foreign nationals of the means to fund terrorism, and generates less pollution. Man-made carbon dioxide is, unequivocally, the cause of global warming. And a warmer climate is more beneficial until places like Arizona are 120 degrees in the summer and the east and west coasts see 10-20ft sea level rises. - Jobs like coal mining, long haul trucking, and manufacturing will be virtually nonexistent within twenty years. Thats millions of blue collar workers that need to be retrained for jobs of the future, like green energy production, 3D printing, etc. - The federal government is the only group that can effectively set employee and consumer protections. The alternative is a hodgepodge of laws and regulations, with some states racing to the bottom. - Everyone wants campaign finance reform. Now we just have to find politicians, left and right, that will embrace it. - LGBTQ individuals can still be legally discriminated against, and laws like the RFRA will continue to be used for that purpose until they have full rights. - If you have the desire and aptitude to go to college, then you should be able to go, regardless of financial circumstances. - Wall Street engages in reckless gambling and incentivizes short term profits at the expense of long term growth and stability. They need to be reigned in. - Flat taxes are unworkable. A progressive tax system means lowering corporate tax rates while eliminating corporate tax loopholes, increasing the estate tax, reducing tax breaks on investment income, increased tax rates on the wealthiest .1%, eliminate loopholes that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy, and make the major expenditures of average Americans like mortgages and rent tax deductible.	monkeybiziu	t1_dhlh3nu

Commander-in-chief uses diplomacy first, to try to avoid shooting wars. As we have an incredibly weakened state department, and generals in charge of foreign policy, that means we don't try diplomacy at all, we jump immediately to shooting. That is the difference between having a qualified Commander-in-chief (Obama), and a President who has no idea what he's doing (Trump).

Don't talk about embarrassing and ignorant when you don't even understand your form of government. We're a democratic republic because we elect representatives to do the voting for us. It has absolutely nothing at all to do with electing the head of state democratically (as all democratic nations do..) Or did you think there were Democracies that didn't elect their heads of state democratically..?  For someone who knows little about the world around him, you sure do throw words like "ignorant" around a bit too flagrantly.	Petrichordate	t1_dhlr4ax

t3_6bdq7r	t1_dhlrryx	1494889254	Powell's the only one saying "story is false".  -  McMaster's and Tillerson's statements don't contradict the article:  -  NSA McMaster's quote in article:  &gt; "The president and foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation."  &gt; "At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly."  [Sec. State Tillerson:](https://twitter.com/jeffzeleny/status/864246607415529472)  &gt; "During President Trump's meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov a broad range of subjects were discussed among which were common efforts and threats regarding counter-terrorism. During that exchange the nature of specific threats were discussed, but they did not discuss sources, methods or military operations."    [Max Rosenthal (WaPo editor)](https://twitter.com/maxjrosenthal/status/864247660806623232)  &gt; Wording is essentially the same as McMaster's, doesn't actually deny anything in our report.  From the article:  &gt; Trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the United States learned only through the espionage capabilities of a key partner. He did not reveal the specific intelligence-gathering method, but he described how the Islamic State was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic State’s territory where the U.S. intelligence partner detected the threat.  -  &gt; The identification of the location was seen as particularly problematic, officials said, because Russia could use that detail to help identify the U.S. ally or intelligence capability involved. Officials said the capability could be useful for other purposes, possibly providing intelligence on Russia’s presence in Syria. Moscow would be keenly interested in identifying that source and perhaps disrupting it.  -  &gt; “Russia could identify our sources or techniques,” the senior U.S. official said.  -  So Trump didn't directly disclose sources or methods... but gave away enough info that the Russians could figure it out.

Is the US sovereign? Yes. Does the power rest in the citizens? With equal right to vote? Yes. Do citizens directly(democracy) or indirectly(republic) elect representatives to wield power? Yes.  Care to explain?  Answer to question above. I'll describe one scenario. You explained to me that Trump is not practicing diplomacy with China because he is taking advantage of them and their situation with NK. You're showing your ignorance again. [this is the defitinion](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diplomacy) of diplomacy(which correlates exactly to our US/China relations above). In you're own words, a US president is taking advantage of China in diplomatic relations revolving around NK. In over _60 years_ no president has been able to achieve this level of diplomatic success involving China and NK. That, in a nutshell, is why I support our President.	EnigmaVIII	t1_dhlrobp

It also boasts that tech industry "luminaries" such as Elon Musk, Sheryl Sandberg, Jeff Bezos and Bill and Melinda Gates appeared at the 2016 edition and this year will, along with tech leaders, feature the likes of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards, and New York Times editor Dean Baquet."

Not only that, you blatantly tried to lie about WP, where did they claim a reporter saw it?   Here's the article:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?utm_term=.93429eba3cb8	pizzashill	t1_dhm5nc9
t3_6bfa2t	t1_dhm5syv	1494907758	First of all what Mcmaster is denying is not even what is alleged to have happened.  No one claimed that trump said anything about a military op or specified sources and methods directly.  What the stories claim is that trump started talking about specific intel and then discussed the city in which it came form.    This in and of itself is as mcmasters claims not giving away sources and methods.  But it does put the source at risk if the russians have other info that may be added to this. Additionally sharing any information without the permission of the country that shared it is very irresponsible as it makes them more likely to cut us off in the future.  This was such a big deal that the whitehouse had to call the CIA and NSA immediately so they could start notifying the source country.  This has been independently confirmed by the Washington post and Reuters	politisaurus_rex	t1_dhm5nc9

t3_6bfa2t	t1_dhm5v1e	1494907852	"at no time, at no time, were intelligence sources or methods discussed".  This looks like it will be the spin.  Tillerson said the same thing.      They are denying something that the story never claimed.      Shame to see McMaster stooping this low.	SlippidySlappity	t3_6bfa2t
t3_6bfa2t	t1_dhm5vqm	1494907886	&gt; White House officials defended Trump. “This story is false,” said Dina Powell, deputy national security adviser for strategy. “The president only discussed the common threats that both countries faced.”  &gt; But officials could not explain why staff members nevertheless felt it necessary to alert the CIA and the NSA.	nanopicofared	t1_dhm5p74
t3_6bfa2t	t1_dhm5wgd	1494907918	But wait. McMaster's statemetns were: "at no time, at no time, were intelligence sources or methods discussed." "And the president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known,"  The Washington Post article doesn't contradict this. We know that Trump did not discuss military operations, he didn't discuss sources, or methods. What he did do is reveal a specific threat about laptops on planes, and he also revealed where the unnamed source got the information (which is a city that is an ISIS operations center). Disseminating that kind of info compromises the source and it's dangerous.  This is a high stakes game, and a slight slip can result in information networks being shut done and worse, loss of life.   As for this whole fake news crap, I'm sorry but the Washington Post has very high standards. It seems that fake news is anything that the Trump camp doesn't like.	benfotheque	t1_dhm5nc9
t3_6bfa2t	t1_dhm5xmx	1494907970	&gt;&gt; "There's nothing the president takes more seriously than the security of the American people," McMaster told reporters. &gt; &gt;&gt; "The story that came out tonight as reported is false," he added. &gt; &gt;And here is yet another anti-Trump hit piece by the media that has been proven to be fake news. Trump never gave classified information to the Russians, but sadly, this post will probably get downvoted and people here will continue to circlejerk and gobble up the fake news story that he did...  &gt; &gt;   McMaster said "the president and the foreign minister reviewed a range of common threats to our two countries, including threats to civil aviation" and that "at no time, at no time, were intelligence **sources** or **methods** discussed."  Trump lost a lot of his supporter in the Senate and house over this, especially after McMaster refused to say that trump didn't reveal "code-word only" classified intelligence. They know that Russia and Iran share Intel, so they are 100% this info is going straight into the ayatollahs hands. Trump betrayed Christians and Jews by gifting Iran Americans most crucial into on Isis. So sad it makes you want to laugh out loud.	trumpdicted	t1_dhm5nc9

t3_6bfa2t	t1_dhm60og	1494908109	Yep and Susan Hennessey (former NSA lawyer) retweeting sources talking about the ally we fked over being Jordan.   Also, seeing a lot of people with IC ties talking about how this is a HUGE fkup in terms of working with other allies and that McMaster basically has to downplay this as a matter of national security and thats why he's trying to re-frame the issue.  He's specifically signalling to other IC allies that Trump didn't blow their agents cover.....yet  This is also my pure speculation: I wouldnt be surprised if McMaster was the leak source...and he's doing this to cover his tracks...but he leaked primarily for other IC allies to know that their agents' covers/operations are at risk from being exposed by Trump	dotmatrixprinter2	t1_dhm5v1e

Although he did say "The story, as reported by the Washington Post, was false".   Makes me wonder if there is some tidbit in the story that is not quite right. Because I don't think McMaster is at the point of outright lying. But as of now I believe that Trump did blurt out classified information, and it just didn't include the sources or the methods.   The fact he left without any questions which surely would have been "did the President give out classified information", kind of makes me think that.

McMaster ran away without answering questions because he didn't want to admit this national security violation is so grave it's absolutely grounds for impeachment.	this-issparta	t1_dhm60og

t3_6bfl98	t1_dhm9gxb	1494914750	I think a lot of us on the left are putting a great deal of faith in either the military (indirectly through Mattis or the DoD) or the FBI to remove Trump from power.  What are the alternatives? That Trump suddenly has a crisis of conscience and realizes that he is unfit to lead a democracy? That he resigns and hands the reigns to a political party which cares for nothing but power?  There are no good outcomes here. Whatever follows Trump won't be a council of the good and the wise. It will just be another footnote in a textbook titled "The Rise and   Fall of the USA".	Caracaos	t1_dhm8u75
t3_6bfgw3	t1_dhm9hjz	1494914787	I would like to see all three of these simultaneously.   Trump slaps handcuffs on, crawls into a body bag, and slithers off the White House lawn like an inchworm, completely on his own volition.	braininabox	t1_dhm7e6x
t3_6be8hx	t1_dhm9jgr	1494914906	Even if they weren't providing intel on Russian activity, the fear is that the source is now compromised. Say it's an Israeli source tracking ISIS movements.

Hannity *does* realize that the White House isn't a tribal cult where if your leak dethrones a President, that makes *you* President, right?   Right?	ninemiletree	t3_6bfpjw
t3_6bfl98	t1_dhm9qxp	1494915380	That's awfully pessimistic of you.  There are plenty of good outcomes here.  An entire generation of people feel the desire to care about its countries ethics again.  people have been contacting their representatives and informing themselves (properly) more than ever before.  120 days wont destroy the world.  No party stays in power forever. While 2018 may seem like a long distance away its hardly a lifetime.  Even on their best days Congress had to resort to breaking House rules to achieve even the most minor victories.  You can look at this as a downfall of something, but look at it as the downfall of a false mentality, that a government can be run like a business and that.  There never has been a government run by the "good", only the accountable.  I'm not in any way saying that the Trump Presidency is good, far from it, but assuming that's its all down hill from here knocks of a lack of perspective.	wakka-wakka-wakka	t1_dhm9gxb
t3_6bfgw3	t1_dhm9rre	1494915434	Yes, but he doesn't know it.  He would be happier if he resigned or were removed from office. I mean, sure, he'd be *unbelievably* sullen for a while, but he'd be happier in the end. I saw a clip of him in a GOP primary debate recently, and man did he have more energy back then.  However, he isn't *intentionally* trying to get impeached. He'll never willingly give this up, because he has no self-awareness at all, and he's just not the kind of person to ever let go of something he has.	nosewings	t3_6bfgw3

t3_6bfl98	t1_dhmacuw	1494916804	You can't be sure of anything, so don't bother with that.  More important is to know what you believe, tell yourself what matters to you, and what you're willing to do to preserve it.    Call your reps, check the votes going on in your local munipalities and districts.  It will stop when people stop panicing and start realizing that they (you) are the catalyst for effective change.  You have a voice too, you have a vote and you have a genuine investment in preserving democracy.  You're not helpless, none of us are.	wakka-wakka-wakka	t1_dhma8lb
t3_6bfpjw	t1_dhmad52	1494916823	&gt; Trump is almost done, then we can get back to the issues at hand  I agree. Though the target will be 2 years plus one day to give Pence a shot at running twice as an incumbent. Trouble is, once Trump is gone the Republicans bulldoze their agenda through effectively and Medicare, among other things, is gone. The Trump distraction is great for keeping the GOP occupied elsewhere. Trouble is, in the meantime the world is hanging by a thread with a madman holding the scissors. I'm sure Republican leaders are as honestly worried about that as the rest of us, just hoping they can hold it together for another 18-20 months before starting a long removal process ending on Pence Day.

A really great chance to win at this point.  With only 5% in the polls, as a virtually unknown candidate, in the 2016 primary he closed a 60% gap with Clinton, who had the biggest brand and political machine ever known to the Democratic party. Now he’s the most popular politician in the U.S. by a long shot, and his core supporters (millennials) will be more plentiful and politically active, and his detractors (Boomers) are dying off— and it’s hard to imagine he’ll be facing a candidate who will have as much political capital as Clinton did.  Not to mention he’ll have spent 4 years squarely in the public eye, debating republicans (like tonight with Kasich), introducing popular legislation, supporting progressive causes, vocally taking on Trump, and campaigning for democrats and progressives around the country.  It's doubtful Samders and Clinton would both back the same candidate, because they both clearly have different agendas.	filmantopia	t1_dhmeutu

t3_6bfl98	t1_dhmnbzz	1494944317	Of course Bernie did. And Hillary probably would have supported Bernie if he were the only chance the dems had to beat Trump.   But given the option, Hillary's agenda is much different that Sanders. She is an intense war hawk, and supports the imperialist US effort for foreign resource-hoarding wars. She also wants to protect the bankers who have given her millions both personally and politically.   The Democratic Party worked to sabatoge Bernie for a reason-- many of them would actually rather have someone like Trump than a real progressive like Bernie. Perpetual war, Wall st., corporate money in politics-- these things are protected under a GOP administration.

Of course, she's done things that are not pretty.  But these things have been magnified 10 times worse than it really is, by the GOP and bought by many on the left.  Hillary Clinton is not poison and it is too bad many like you can't take it.  Part of the reasons people like you are so bitter and mad is because she isn't saying anything wrong.  She isn't doing anything wrong.  The only thing you folks can come up with is "she's toxic".  Too bad, the woman ain't going anywhere.  Good for her.  And shame on people like you.	vph	t1_dhmn5tz

This is a man with a history of speaking truth to power, and who had bipartisan support when he was appointed NSA in the wake of the Flynn scandal. He is widely regarded as a man with integrity, nuance and pragmatism, and yet last night he gets up in front of the American people and makes an obvious attempt to deflect and deny without actually addressing the specific allegations made in the Washington Post report. Why? This does not seem like something that a man with McMaster's reputation would be able to do with a clear conscience... ...unless, of course, McMaster (who by his own admission was in the room at the time) is the one who leaked the story to the Washington Post.

t3_6biwd3	t1_dhmycsd	1494956213	Trump is not going to be impeached.  Even if the Democrats take the House in 2018, they can only approve of the articles of impeachment. The actual attempt at removal from office happens in the Senate.  Given the current political landscape, not only is it borderline impossible for the Democratic party to take the Senate in 2018, it's possible that the Republicans could even gain seats.  You need a 2/3 majority in the senate in order to get Trump removed from office. That's 67 senators. Even if the Democrats somehow won every Republican seat that's up for grabs (there are 8 republican senators up for re-election in 2018) and lost none, they'd still need about a dozen Republican senators to vote against their party. The chances of that happening are exceedingly small.  One would think that the ever-growing list of acts that Trump has committed since literally the first day of his campaign (when he called Mexicans rapists and criminals) should have long since been enough to sink his political career several times over. But the sad fact is that Trump is a presidential "Teflon Don", in that no matter what people think of him or his actions, he never seems to suffer anything even remotely resembling political repercussions for his actions. Republicans who originally thought their best course of action was to stay as far away from Trump as humanly possible have found that aligning themselves with him has actually helped their political careers so far. Even all of the recent actions involving leaking state secrets to Russia, holding meetings at Putin's request, the controversy surrounding Comey's firing, and so much more....the Republican base and Trump's core supporters have so far stuck by him and have suffered no consequences for doing so. If admitting to and defending obstructing justice and leaking state secrets to Russia isn't enough to cause the GOP to abandon ship, there's no reason to believe that the situation is going to change any time soon.  As of right now, you'd have to convince 22 House Republicans and 19 Republican Senators to vote for impeachment. The votes simply are just not there. In 2 years, the absolute best-case scenario would still involve flipping about a dozen GOP senators.  Given the GOP's party-over-country mentality, I wouldn't be holding my breath.

When intel officials have to "dumb down" briefs to Trump's level of comprehension, inexorably the important nuances of international espionage will go over the simpleminded.

I think he got the diplomats here talk strategy to cover up his money connection in Russia. Trump's ego is fragile. His concerns about himself far out weigh that of the country's.	anetk	t3_6bjfjq
t3_6bjfjq	t1_dhn32px	1494961283	I mean, they're technically right.  Once the president says it it's not exactly classified anymore.  It may have been claissified *before* he shared the details, but as soon as they came out of his mouth they became declassified.  Still a hilarious premise for an article.  As if Russia would be like "yeah he gave us a bunch of classified intel"	funnychicken	t3_6bjfjq
t3_6bj2lv	t1_dhn33ao	1494961301	A different report (they're starting to blend together or I'd link it specifically) said that folks in the administration have to leak shit in order to get the blowback to kick Trump in the ass when he ignores or works against them. It's fucking chaos and this is absurd if it's true. If it's true, McMaster leaks so he can be taken seriously and then the press office takes most of the impact by needing to defend the indefensible and getting blamed when it doesn't work.  *And none of them need to be a part of this mechanism.* You're trying to protect and serve the country, its interests, and its safety, and the entire time, the dude at the top cuts you off at the knees. You're bailing out the Titanic with a top hat at some point, and support with the base only sticks if enough people continue to give him aid and cover. That extends to Congress and conservative media.   There's going to be a right side and a wrong side of history. I doubt the stat that 48% of people supporting impeachment indicates that protecting Trump is the right side of history.	ophelia_jones	t1_dhn0ncb

t3_6bjr1g	t1_dhn6y7e	1494965513	He's complaining about the accusation that he wasn't authorized to share the photos with the Russian Foreign Press. He's essentially saying that this is Standard Operating Procedure, and that nothing is unusual.  He took the photos, and he shared them with Russian state press like he always does, and that the White House would have known about that.  Which is all true, really.  The White House should have expected the photographs to be published, not just secretly kept in a special photo album for Lavrov to keep by his bed and cherish.   The problem is that the White House was either too stupid to think that the photos would be published, or just actively wanted to embarrass and humiliate the press in retaliation for not saying nice things about Trump. With this administration I wouldn't be surprised if it was a bit of both, wanting to embarass the press, but also Trump not thinking that the Russians would post a picture containing Kislyak.	zeidrich	t1_dhn61ut

t3_6bk4a1	t1_dhnd1nz	1494972486	Include the full context of that passage, if you're going to try and debate it's merits:  &gt;Sanger, who was arrested several times in her efforts to bring birth control to women in the United States, set up her first clinic in Brooklyn in 1916. **In the late 1930s, she sought to bring clinics to black women in the South, in an effort that was called the “Negro Project.” Sanger wrote in 1939 letters to colleague Clarence James Gamble that she believed the project needed a black physician and black minister to gain the trust of the community:**  &gt;Sanger, 1939: The minister’s work is also important and he should be trained, perhaps by the Federation as to our ideals and the goal that we hope to reach. We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.  &gt;**Sanger says that a minister could debunk the notion, if it arose,** that the clinics aimed to “exterminate the Negro population.”   &gt;#**She didn’t say that she wanted to “exterminate” the black population.**   &gt;The Margaret Sanger Papers Project at New York University says that **this quote has “gone viral on the Internet,” normally out of context**, and it “doesn’t reflect the fact that Sanger recognized elements within the black community might mistakenly associate the Negro Project with racist sterilization campaigns in the Jim Crow south, unless clergy and other community leaders spread the word that the Project had a humanitarian aim.”  She was simply concerned people would come up with ridiculous conspiracy theories like you're propagating. Hell, the very article discusses how people like you are quoting it out of context, and you unethically omit that portion of the article when quoting it here.   ***That, sir or ma'am, is intellectual dishonesty.***	zetec	t1_dhnc9ln

t3_6bl017	t1_dhnv4d7	1494995700	You have an oversimplified understanding of the subject. I get where you are coming from, you haven't been taught about this stuff, and the media you watch has an agenda to make this a wedge issue for you so you keep voting for them.   People coming out different sometimes from their mothers and fathers is essentially the basis for the theory of evolution.  Also, if you have more than one boy or girl, they will not be exactly the same person. (Who would have thunk it?) Lots of things often go wrong in the womb too. My point is, people don't always come out as 1 of 2 things like you say.   Gender and sex are not easily separable because there was a feedback loop between the too as we evolved. Believe it or not, the brain, and the rest of the nervous system, is part of the body. So you deny science, and medical research on the subject, because you think it's gross and something about it being in the brain. Because you can't spend the time to even learn about it for yourself.  There is no evidence anyone is trying to turn everyone trans, if that's what you are getting at with the whole "making a mental disorder (normal)" bit. If your own masculinity is so in question that you feel this is a realistic possibility that most people might consider, maybe you should see a gender therapist. (And yes, that's a joke. But you opened yourself up to it, sorry.)	TheWorstWords	t1_dhnubzj
t3_6bmhjm	t1_dhnv4jg	1494995708	And Antisemitism is another term that's constantly thrown out to shut down any attacks on Israel, it's actually the original buzzword.  It could even be considered a "conceptual superweapon."  http://squid314.livejournal.com/329561.html   &gt;&gt; This tendency reaches its most florid manifestation in the "ideological bingo games". See for example "Skeptical Sexist Bingo", feminist bingo, libertarian troll bingo, anti-Zionist bingo, pro-Zionist bingo, and so on. If you Google for these you can find thousands, which is too bad because every single person who makes one of these is going to Hell.  &gt;&gt; Let's look at the fourth one, "Anti-Zionist Bingo." Say that you mention something bad Israel is doing, someone else accuses you of being anti-Semitic, and you correct them that no, not all criticism of Israel is necessarily anti-Semitic and you're worried about the increasing tendency to spin it that way.  &gt;&gt; And they say "Hahahahahhaa he totally did it, he used the 'all criticism of Israel gets labeled anti-Semitic' argument, people totally use that as a real argument hahahaha they really are that stupid, I get 'B1' on my stupid stereotypical critics of Israel bingo!"  &gt;&gt; You say "Uh, look, I'm not really sure what you're getting at. I recognize that there is real anti-Semitism and I am just as opposed to it as you are but surely when when see the state excusing acts of violence against Palestinians in the West Bank we..."  &gt;&gt; And they say "Hahahhaha G1, I got G1, he pulled the old 'I abhor real anti-Semitism' line this is great, guys come over here and look at what this guy is doing he's just totally parroting all the old arguments every anti-Semite uses!"  &gt;&gt; So it may be scary when your opponent is unaware of your arguments, but it is much scarier when your opponent has a sort of vague dreamlike awareness of your arguments, which immediately pattern-match cached thoughts about how horrible a person you would have to be to make them.   &gt;&gt; But this is still not the scariest thing.  &gt;&gt; Because if your opponent brings out the Bingo card, you can just tell them exactly what I am saying here. You can explain to the pro-Israel person that they are pattern-matching your responses, that you don't know what strawman anti-Zionist they're thinking of but that you have legitimate reasons for believing what you do and you request a fair hearing, and that if they do not repent of their knee-slapping pattern-matching Bingo-making ways they are going to Hell.  &gt;&gt; No, the scariest thing would be if one of those bingo cards had, in the free space in the middle: "You are just pattern-matching my responses. I swear that I have something legitimate to tell you which is not just a rehash of the straw-man arguments you've heard before, so please just keep an open mind and hear me out."  &gt;&gt; If someone did that, even Origen would have to admit they were beyond any hope of salvation. Any conceivable attempt to explain their error would be met with a "Hahahaha he did the 'stop-pattern matching I'm not a strawman I'm not an inhuman monster STOP FILLING OUT YOUR DAMN BINGO CARD' thing again! He's so hilarious, just like all those other 'stop-pattern matching I am not a strawman' people whom we know only say that because they are inhuman monsters!"  &gt;&gt; But surely no one could be that far gone, right?  &gt;&gt; But surely no one could be that far gone, right?  &gt;&gt; Listen:  &gt;&gt; "I'm not racist, but..."  &gt;&gt; If you are like everyone else on the Internet, your immediate response is "Whoever is saying that is obviously a racisty racist who loves racism! I can't believe he literally used the 'I'm not racist, but...' line in those exact words! The old INRB! I've got to get home as fast as I can to write about this on my blog and tell everyone I really met one of those people!"  &gt;&gt; But why would someone use INRB? It sounds to me like what they are saying is: "Look. I know what I am saying is going to sound racist to you. You're going to jump to the conclusion that I'm a racist and not hear me out. In fact, maybe you've been trained to assume that the only reason anyone could possibly assert it is racism and to pattern-match this position to a racist straw man version. But I actually have a non-racist reason for saying it. Please please please for the love of Truth and Beauty just this one time throw away your prejudgments and your Bingo card and just listen to what I'm going to say with an open mind."  &gt;&gt; And so you reply "Hahahaha! He really used the 'look I know what I'm saying is going to sound racist to you you're going to jump to the conclusion that I'm a racist and not hear me out in fact maybe you've been trained to assume...' line! What a racist! Point and laugh, everyone! POINT AND LAUGH!"  &gt;&gt; And of course "sexist" works just as well as "racist" here, even though the latter is more familiar.  &gt;&gt; This is what I mean by "conceptual superweapon". This is what it looks like to stare into the barrel of a gigantic lunar-based death ray and abandon all hope. This is why I find feminism and the social justice community in general so scary.	pizzashill	t1_dhnuy7i

And interesting enough - everywhere you look, you can find articles claiming a religion is discriminated against?

t3_6bmhjm	t1_dhnweeh	1494998063	It was actually religious I believe until the late 1890s, and as Jews started marrying into Christian families and converting it became racial, this was also around the time 'racial hygiene" became a thing.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_hygiene  https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007171  &gt;&gt; These new "antisemites," as they called themselves, drew upon older stereotypes to maintain that the Jews behaved the way they did—and would not change—because of innate racial qualities inherited from the dawn of time. Drawing as well upon the pseudoscience of racial eugenics, they argued that the Jews spread their so-called pernicious influence to weaken nations in Central Europe not only by political, economic, and media methods, but also literally by "polluting" so-called pure Aryan blood by intermarriage and sexual relations with non-Jews. They argued that Jews did this deliberately in order to sap the will and ability of Germans or Frenchmen or Hungarians to resist a biologically determined "Jewish drive" for world domination.  &gt;&gt; Though secular racists drew upon religious imagery and stereotypes to define hereditary Jewish "behavior," they insisted that alleged Jewish "traits" were handed down from generation to generation. Since "Jews" did not form a religious group, but a "race," the conversion of an individual Jew to Christianity did not change his racial "Jewishness" and was therefore by nature an insincere conversion.	pizzashill	t1_dhnw5ky

In it, Comey said the president asked him to abandon the Flynn investigation, according to a person who was given a copy of the memo and spoke on condition of anonymity.  &gt; “I hope you can let this go,” Trump told the FBI director, according to the memo as cited by the New York Times, which first reported its existence.

t3_6bkvdj	t1_dho89jh	1495026248	one off the top of my head i can tell you that the washington post, via "sources" reported that the FBI didn't have enough resources to investigate Trump's russia ties.   And that fake news story, unfortunately, has lived on. Go ahead and google "Trump FBI russia investigation resources" or some kind of combo of that and the first 10+ articles that will come up are around that story, implying that Comey was asking for more resources for the investigation and wasn't getting them.  But just last week, Andrew McCabe testified, when asked specifically about this, that they did have adequate resources, and that the investigation was still going on.  [Link here](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/five-takeaways-from-fbi-director-andrew-mccabes-testimony-on-comey-trump-russia/article/2622812)  Again this is just one, but a recent example. There are plenty others that are never debunked, they just sort of sit there in internet limbo without any sources ever coming out.  The fake news media doesn't ever have to prove these because they'll just switch to the next topic.  By the time they've moved on though, the damage is done, and these fake news articles with anonymous sources remain forever.	thedaynos	t1_dho7nwq

t3_6boncc	t1_dho9ejg	1495027838	I, too, wish for him to make a full recovery.

t3_6bl017	t1_dhoa46d	1495028773	This is not debatable. A person let say that might have serious issues is a person like a hermaphrodite . Who having both reproductive organs has a hard time choosing which one. And rightfully so. Or a person born with none. But all people are born of female and male genes. And to have perfectly functioning male or female people start to think they can just change their entire DNA structure and think it's ok, is not ok. Because even like Bruce Jener now Caitlyn Jener is still 100% male, man . He cut his privates off and takes hormones to grow boobs. That doenst make him a woman and it never will.

t3_6bos8k	t1_dhobt0r	1495030857	I enjoy him though his show doesn't have as much "punch" as Hayes or Maddow, but at the end of the night, it's nice to sort of recap with a winding down feel.    I do find his intense hatred of Trump amusing. He was one of the first to just come out and call Trump out for being a liar instead of dancing around it politely.  Though if he is going to be replaced, I hope it's Ari Melber.  Ari was in his place a few nights this week, now has a Sunday show of his own, but with the developments, and the pace of them, especially legal and Constitutional challenges and issues, I do enjoy how Ari goes into events coming from a legal standpoint.   To be honest, I'd move O'Donnell to Matthews slot then give Matthews a Sunday show.  Matthews does good with the more 1:1 type interviews but on a daily basis, at 7:00 PM when just coming home from work, he's so yelly-screamy and [constantly overtalks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0FCcjwV9Kw).

t3_6bos8k	t1_dhocei4	1495031546	Yes he's intelligent and has a breadth of journalistic and political experiences which benefit the viewer and set a professional example for the industry.  There's plenty room on MSNBC's schedule for amateurs and developing talent to maintain a dynamic and competitive pace and to its credit one need only view the example of Rachel Maddow.

To say a mechanical engineering degree makes you a scientist would be the same as saying an ASE certified auto mechanic is the same as a mechanical engineer. Yes, he went to college, but he didn't study "science" he studied "engineering" which is the application of science which is already in place.

When robberies turn violent because of a struggle as the police believe happened, the would be robber often just flees immediately in a panic/attempt not to be caught at the scene. Apparently these nutters think a secret assassin left the guy lying conscious and alive on the street after a "hit" or whatever.   Oh and he was a Clinton supporter. Oh and there's literally no conceivable way he'd have access to the information Wikileaks released, unless he hacked it the same way Russians appeared to while leaving Russian signatures everywhere.  It's pretty typical conspiracy theorist nonsense where there's no actual evidence to support it, but they keep coming up with inane "questions about the official version" that they pretend positively prove anything about their evidence-less argument. Most of the questions stem from fundamental ignorance about a subject which they refuse  to believe when corrected.	RepublicansAreScum	t1_dhork6q

You assume they get to choose. Usually their parents and doctors make that choice for them. Many times later in life, former hermaphrodites feel like they should have been a different gender, even when they didn't know they were born both. Why is that? Could it be there is something genetic that sets our gender identity?     When you are older, you may be lucky enough to marry and be in a relationship. And you'll go out with your guy friends and when you come home your wife will ask you all these questions about 'what did you guys talk about?" and you are like, "Talk? We just drank beer and played games."   Your wife will look at you as if you are from another planet. Now imagine living in her world day after day after day. All the talking and talking and talking - about the fat, and the clothes, and the relationships. Eventually, it would be unbearable.  Anyway, I'm not transgender, but I believe what I describe above is probably what it'd be like.

In all likelihood it being spread substantially during the election and in the past few days is a result of direct Russian efforts to push the story through social media manipulation. If that sounds like it's own conspiracy theory I can dredge up some sources but in the Russia election interference public hearings our national security officials have stated as much openly, though not about this specific Seth Rich story, just broadly pushing fake news to Trump and Sanders groups that would make them anti democrat/anti Hillary.  It helps muddy the waters about Russia's clear involvement by attempting to blame someone else for the leak while making Hillary look bad. Basically the perfect fake news story for Putin.

Trying to make it look like wikileaks is defending their informant.  It's a shame what Assange has done to wikileaks since he took over and the Russians got to him, back when they were using him to pimp those lies about Afghanistan.  Russia has always wanted Afghanistan because it would give them access to a blue water port in the south which is of crucial geopolitical importance.

t3_6bqq84	t1_dhou02j	1495050606	IIRC the idea that Seth Rich was the leak source was put forward before any of us had heard the Russian angle.   Basically there's a long running conspiracy theory that the Clintons are murdering people left and right to fulfill their political goals. Rich died shortly before the DNC leaks started so the 'obvious' conclusion was that he supplied the emails to Wikileaks and the Clintons had him murdered for it.	flounder19	t1_dhoshy9
t3_6bqq84	t1_dhou48c	1495050728	The thing is the Bernie crowd won't accept responsibility. They continue to try to justify their position on why they protest voted. Their excuse is because the DNC "wronged" Bernie. However, this was the exact thing the Russians wanted them to think! The Russians targeted the Bernie or bust crowd with extreme success and they willingly voted against their interests. I continue to see constant justification on why the DNC deserved to loose and how they protest voted so trump could win. The only thing they don't realize is they were brainwashed by Russia just as effectively as the far right was.	moderate_lucy666	t1_dhotmyk
t3_6bqq84	t1_dhou4jj	1495050737	Regardless of whether you believe Seth Rich died in a botched robbery, was assassinated, or is secretly alive in the Arctic, Julien Assange has used him as an example of the dangers leakers face, wikileaks has offered a 20 thousand dollar reward for information about his murder, and Assange retweets articles connecting him with the leaks.    All these are very strong indications that he was the leaker, as it seems unlikely that WikiLeaks would choose some random robbery victim and makes these connections with them.  So without needing to believe any conspiracy at all about his death, the fact remains it seems likely based on the available evidence that it was him who provided information to wikileaks.  This is significant because it so drastically damages the narrative of "Russian meddling in the elections" since documents published by WikiLeaks are often cited as the prime example of this.  And so, although Assange has all but said that Seth Rich was the source of the leaks (without implicitly staying so as that would violate WikiLeaks policy) the connection is largely ignored  by the mainstream media.

So I can see why you'd think they wouldn't do something that would just discredit them completely like fabricate a connection to a murderer DNC staffer which could easily be disproved by showing hard evidence of the Russia hack. I mean yes that part makes sense..  But I can't believe that this whole Russia connection and investigation and everything is just a big orchestrated partisan farce, and even CNN and the NY Times etc etc etc are colluding? I mean, that would just be completely unprecedented.   It's a lot easier and more effective and less risky to just wait 4 years and run an honest election.	imissobama	t1_dhou4jj

t3_6bqq84	t1_dhow9ev	1495052993	You don't have to throw out the idea of Russian hacking, I'm sure most sophisticated countries participate in espionage against the government's of foreign nations, and I wouldn't doubt this is the case with Russia.  The idea of collusion between Trump and Russia centers around the idea that Russia *provided* the hacked information that was damaging to Clinton to be leaked, therefore helping Donald Trump.    Regardless of what information Russia​ obtained, if it was Seth Rich who *provided the information that was actually leaked*, then the idea of Russia helping elect, or colluding with Trump to impact the election, loses a lot of steam.  You don't have to believe Seth Rich was murdered *because of the leaks*, and you don't have to disbelieve that Russia hacked into election campaigns.   If you follow the evidence, it seems WikiLeaks is indicating that Seth Rich is their source.  This means regardless of what information Russia had, they weren't the ones who made it publicly available and therefore it seems the credibility of claims they manipulated and impacted the election are overblown.  Thus, Trump's assertion that the Russia angle is mostly an excuse for the Democratic defeat.	Gwandeh	t1_dhov4tv

Can the FBI conduct an investigation independent from the department of Justice. Or does the FBI have to disclose all it's investigations to the DOJ? And does it have to get the Attorney General's consent?  &gt;COMEY: Well we work with the Department of Justice, whether that's main justice or U.S. attorney's offices on all of our investigations.  &gt;And so we work with them and so in a legal sense we're not independent of the department of justice.

And since i am post limited here   To those who say Comey was talking about the doj or  ag :  So the head of the fbi ...a lawyer... would knowingly make an overly broad false statement when in the back of his mind he is carrying the deep knowledge that the president has done what they just asked him.  Especially when he specially noted it would BE A BIG DEAL.  but not big enough to properly phrase an answer to avoid perjury?

t3_6bl017	t1_dhp6kp0	1495065442	&gt;I don't think those two things are comparable.  You still haven't swung me just by saying this. I need to know, specifically, how this is different from Napoleon above, and in what way / ways. If Napoleon makes you uncomfortable, you may also use Rachel Dolezal or Shaun King (trans-black individuals) and explain how trans-racialism is different and in what way and why we should deny those people their delusion / fantasy (for lack of a better term), but play into the delusions of trans-gender people.  &gt;  Because we can determine reality via social consensus, actually.  Ok, so if I have a rabbit, and I ask a classroom "What is the sex of this rabbit" (without knowing beforehand) we can determine the sex of the rabbit by simply taking a poll of the class' opinion / preference?	the_blur	t1_dhp0c5v
t3_6bl017	t1_dhp9rvb	1495069418	Yeah, a quote out of context generally doesn't swing minds. I went on with my argument that followed from that in regards to the feedback loop and evolution, which you ignored. If you believe in evolution, then surely you agree social consensus dictates to some extent how we evolve? (Furthermore, language has a profound effect on how we talk about and think about others. Which is why the alt-right is so stuck on identity-politics, despite most of their arguments saying nothing. Saying truisms about the world, but defining them as a boogie-man. It's very effective, too. Especially when you have vocal-minority straw-men on the left you can point too. )  I don't care about Rachel Dolezal or Shaun King, and I don't know why you do either. Or if someone wants to think they Napoleon. (Generally we give people with delusions like this drugs...  which don't work on trans people or make this trans "delusion" go away. Which means it has a different cause, and mechanism. Transitioning works.) As long as they aren't hurting anyone, if that makes them happy, whatever. If they aren't hurting anyone else, more power to them. I think we need more cultural appropriation if multiculturalism is actually going to work. Otherwise our differences are just used to divide us. Maybe you guys need to stop getting so caught up in the labels and identity politics. Just consider people as people. Not all trans people even care that much about labels in such a profound identity oriented way.  What does it even mean to "play into a delusion"? When do you know it's harmful? How is this all not a value judgment on your part? Have you ever talked to someone experiencing mania or delusions? There is a rather profound difference. (With lots of associated issues like lack of insight and issues with executive functioning, to name a few.) If you treated trans-ness like someone with delusions, that would mean trips to the psychiatric wards, and anti-psychotics. Under the threat of force. (And, yes, many of the people who make your arguments online, do threaten this.)  In fact, I never would have been found on the internet talking about this stuff, until my community started to get attacked. I'm quite worried for my future. If things get bad enough here in America, I'll probably just add myself to the statistic, and you guys can be happier knowing you are a little more right. I don't understand or like the arguments I hear from either side when it comes to trans issues, so I make my own, but I know that people with your point of view seem intent on destroying my life, and the lives of others like me. I feel like you guys project your liberal straw man onto everyone you meet, and as result you always get the same result. Telling people they are delusional, is never a good way to start a conversation. (To people who have heard that before, often in really bad contexts.)   Anyways, I've had these conversations so many times, I don't even know why I try anymore. I guess I'm hoping there is some key to getting through to you guys, because I feel hopeless. It's at the point where you are all so resistant to it, that I don't even want to believe any of you are even real. I just wish the world wasn't so terrifying, and that people like you didn't want to hurt me and try to delegitimize my existence in order to create laws that will likely result in violence being taken towards me. (Or a complete joke, as is the case with the bathroom laws. Where you would have trans-men and trans-women using restrooms of the opposite gender, normalizing the very thing you are trying to prevent, since some of us pass VERY well. You would have large muscular bearded men in the women's room.)	TheWorstWords	t1_dhp6kp0

t3_6bx2ut	t1_dhq5gvi	1495123153	&gt;Flynn left little doubt about the answer.  Not only did he remain loyal to President Trump; he indicated that he and the president were still in communication. “I just got a message from the president to stay strong,” Flynn said after the meal was over, according to two sources who are close to Flynn and are familiar with the conversation, which took place on April 25.  Please keep communicating with Trump! It only makes the process easier for investigators.	dafdiego777	t3_6bx2ut

t3_6bx2ut	t1_dhq5qfy	1495123438	You don't understand. There's nothing to the story and it has been fake news since November. That's why we have a special prosecutor and Flynn was fired. Comey being fired is this weird unrelated coincidence. Trump had to fire him for doing that Clinton thing Trump was happy about. No other option really.	DueProcessPanda	t1_dhq5mt1

Is this action by Trump and his administration enough to convince the GOP and their supporters to quickly impeach Trump so the U.S. can move on?"    At this point, Trump is nothing more than a distracting figurehead that can do serious damage while accomplishing nothing.  He's like a decrepit building planted on a five block radius in the central of town.  It's time to tear it down.	Mawontalk	t3_6bx2ut

t3_6bxgsi	t1_dhq8v81	1495126699	The only reason Drudge, Fox, and Brietbart are popular is because there wasnt a single media entity representing the right side of the spectrum.

Edit to add [these](https://youtu.be/5IPyv4KgTAA) [documentaries](https://youtu.be/813V_GId5N8) that should be considered required viewing to better understand the historical context and role Stone, Ailes, et al have had on our country's politics and culture.

t3_6bxgsi	t1_dhqa1eq	1495127954	I'm probably going to get downvoted for this, but stories like this one are what drives a lot of people to shitty conservative media. This is not the time to publish a story bashing Ailes. The man just died, and even though there is a slew of controversy around him, it's in really bad taste to publish this story on the day of his death. This is why people flock to men like Trump who constantly decry the "liberal media". This just adds fuel to that fire.	EndersCraft	t3_6bxgsi
t3_6bxgsi	t1_dhqaatz	1495128228	&gt;a single media entity representing the right side of the spectrum.  oh, bullshit. National Review formed in 1955. American Spectator in 1927. Wall Street Journal and Christian Science Monitor have had right leaning editorial boards since forever.   Fox, Drudge, Breitbart et al became popular because there's an entire segment of the right who were too lazy or stupid to get their info from traditional conservative sources and preferred to be whipped into perpetual outrage by right-wing shock radio in the 1980s.	prettymuchhatereddit	t1_dhq8v81
t3_6bxgsi	t1_dhqaaw2	1495128230	Are you saying they have morals? Because I think we can all agree that's bullshit. If it was the head of CNN that died they would be thanking God for punishing the fake news media.	TattooSadness	t1_dhqa1eq
t3_6bxgsi	t1_dhqaaz0	1495128233	Here is how Hunter S. Thompson began his obituary for Richard M. Nixon:  &gt;Richard Nixon is gone now, and I am poorer for it. He was the real thing -- a political monster straight out of Grendel and a very dangerous enemy. He could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time. He lied to his friends and betrayed the trust of his family. Not even Gerald Ford, the unhappy ex-president who pardoned Nixon and kept him out of prison, was immune to the evil fallout. Ford, who believes strongly in Heaven and Hell, has told more than one of his celebrity golf partners that "I know I will go to hell, because I pardoned Richard Nixon."  I don't think it's too far a stretch to replace Nixon's name with Ailes's. He was a misogynist and philanderer of the first order, and he divided this nation easily as much as the Vietnam War. He did all of this knowingly, and for that, I hope he is held in the lowest opinion for as long as people know his sullied name. Richard Nixon may have broken the American Dream, but Roger Ailes glued it back together in his own image, and it is fucking hideous.	frankbaptiste	t3_6bxgsi
t3_6bxgsi	t1_dhqacld	1495128282	Really? You can't call a monster a monster in the day of his death? Did Hitler's obituary gloss over the whole genocide thing? What drives people to conservative media is fear and self-loathing. This motherfucker weaponized it for profit. Fuck him and everyone who ever worked for him.	AdvicePerson	t1_dhqa1eq
t3_6bxgsi	t1_dhqafik	1495128368	This is assuming there was a liberal media wing when Fox came about to counter against. It was made basically to push conservative beliefs. Reporting the truth shouldn't have biases, it's just that the truth tends to support "liberal" leaning beliefs and it comes off as left wing hysteria compared to the Fox bullshit.	TattooSadness	t1_dhq8v81
t3_6bxgsi	t1_dhqagl6	1495128399	Who cares?! If people want to feel sorry about the death of one of the shittiest people to ever influence our country, fuck 'em. Sure, you don't need to go out of your way to attack him, but he literally spent his life undermining the legitimacy of these journalists so I definitely understand these type of articles.  People like you would rather keep extending an olive branch to a man that takes another finger with each offer.	heyitschipz	t1_dhqa1eq
t3_6bxgsi	t1_dhqai00	1495128441	Media - by which I'm making the assumption (at my own risk, I know) you mean *journalism* - isn't intended to take or represent a side.  Journalism is intended to be an objective tool - a system used to *report* the goings-on of the day.  Not to add spin or selectively edit, but to simply tell what is happening in a concise and factually accurate form.  Of course, it'd be naive to think that an organization run by human beings would be capable of purging itself of any bias.  But even still, journalism contains protocols that look for bias, that warn the consumer of potential conflicts of interest.  The myriad of right-wing news-media that have come into being over the last three or four decades were not made to fill a gap - they were built to provide a platform for right-wing ideology.  They are both a stage upon which the conservative passion play can be enacted, and mouthpiece through which conservative statements can be amplified to expose more people to them.  Fox, Brietbart, Drudge, etc. did not spring from nothing, either.  Journalism has long been wracked by disingenuous people and organizations.  Struggling against them has been as long a part of journalism as telling the news.  But please do not think that they are filling a gap.  News is news.  Journalism reports the news.  These organizations *do* report what happens, but they inject their own bias - blatantly and brazenly - into it.  They twist the tools of journalism for their own purposes, to propel the right-wing ideology to the fore, to give it the illusion of mass support and appeal.	GearBrain	t1_dhq8v81
t3_6bxgsi	t1_dhqajwp	1495128498	It's called having respect for the dead. And even though others may not show it, I believe that point unnecessary, it's important to still show respect.	EndersCraft	t1_dhqacld

He was a swine of a man who wallowed in indecency and immorality. He was a glutton of intolerance and inhumanity. His **life's goal** was to spread fear, ignorance, paranoia and bigotry and he was quite successful at it. He was a malignant man. His life was in bad taste.

I am worried about the ownership class of the truly wealthy. The right has been successful in creating a wedge between the upper middle class and the rest of the middle and working classes.   The paradox when talking about paying politicians of course is that if we paid them more they would have less incentive to take bribes and/or participate in the revolving door with the private sector. POTUS should make a cool $1m and members of congress should be $300k or so. Tiny when compared to our overall budget...	Zenmachine83	t1_dhqhacb

When the story broke, I felt a bit of outrage, but honestly...it was bias.  When I really thought about it, I remembered I didn't really care that Governor Spitzer had hired high class prostitutes when that story broke in Albany; I just cared about his job record and his stances on issues dear to me, and I suspect that's what most voters care about, too.

t3_6c0lmd	t1_dhr1drf	1495160028	Okay so Rosenstein is affraid of Trump's backlash. He basically knows if he talks that the details will get out and then like Comey he's a target. The investigation will include everything he knows. He can do more from the inside it seems   Or he's helping cripple the investigation. I don't think this though because he had an amazing reputation before this and worked hard on it and I think he's doing what he can.   It seems though someone slammed the breaks right before the car went off the cliff and it feels like we are teetering here, half on half off, in limbo.

t3_6c0lmd	t1_dhr1wi8	1495160757	I don't think Rosenstein is afraid of Trump at all. In fact he's far more secure than ever. Trump can't fire Mueller but he can ask Rosenstein to. Rosenstein can refuse and either resign and make Trump fire him. Trump needs to get someone in place who will toss Mueller. That's pretty much the Saturday Night Massacre that Nixon screwed up with and what ultimately forced him to quit. Trump can fire Rosenstein notwithstanding, but it might be best if Trump slit his own throat right after.	winstonsmith7	t1_dhr1drf

Word is that he contacted Mueller last Wednesday, the day after Comey was fired. As for playing it close to the vest, who knows who is implicated in this quagmire. It's best for them to play their cards close to their chest for the time being.	Freckled_daywalker	t1_dhqzry4
t3_6c0lmd	t1_dhr2c9b	1495161364	Also isn't Comey's firing the biggest thing we have directly on Trump at the moment?  Obstruction of Justice.

t3_6c0lmd	t1_dhr2sbn	1495161976	Well, he could also have responded to the firing of Comey by publicly resigning. Apparently, he almost DID resign. That would have signaled to everyone that he was a man of morals and substance. That principled stand would have followed him for the rest of his career.  But we wouldn't have a special prosecutor in place. Graham wouldn't be publicly saying that the investigation has shifted to a criminal investigation rather than simply counterintelligence. People wouldn't be questioning Rosentstein's motives. *He'd* be personally better off, but I think he might have decided to put the country over the sure-bet for his career. We'll see.

t3_6c23a8	t1_dhrb2bx	1495177423	&gt; Lately, we suspect that Paul Ryan must spend every day in a state of exquisite agony. Each day brings new agonizing things, and some more than others. At times, the speaker of the House, must wake up and already sense impending doom, such as the morning after news has broken that Ryan and other Republicans were caught on tape speculating that Donald Trump might be paid by the Russians. &gt;  &gt; Thursday was one of those days. &gt;  &gt; “There have been some members who have said, ‘We might be better with Vice President Pence,’ ” said a reporter at Ryan’s regularly scheduled news conference in the Capitol basement, implying a President Trump impeachment scenario. &gt;  &gt; “Oh, good grief,” Ryan said, appearing pained. &gt;  &gt; “What’s your take on that?” &gt;  &gt; “I-I-I. We shouldn’t even — I’m not even going to give credence to that. I’m not even going to comment on that. That’s — well, there’s not even a point making a comment on that.” &gt;  &gt; Another question: “Earlier this week, Senator McConnell said, ‘We could do with a little less drama from the White House on a lot of things.’ ” the reporter asked. “Do you agree with that assessment?” &gt;  &gt; Millennials are about to shake up the suburbs &gt; Today’s first-time homebuyers want urban conveniences at affordable prices. What does that mean for the housing market? &gt; “Well, yeah,” said Ryan. “It’s always nice to have less drama.” &gt;  &gt; Did anyone want to ask questions about tax reform? Ryan asked. Did anyone want to talk about the technology-related bills that had passed that week, including one that would “bring the government into the age of cloud computing”? &gt;  &gt; The press seemed only mildly interested in cloud computing. &gt;  &gt; The night before, the deputy attorney general’s office announced the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the Trump campaign’s potential Russia ties. Just a few hours earlier, Ryan had been publicly asked whether he retained full confidence in the president. &gt;  &gt; “I do,” he had said, in the tone of a bridegroom who knows that it’s too late to return the tuxedo. &gt;  &gt; Ryan says GOP could do with 'less drama,' but supports special counsel decision &gt; Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) spoke positively about the Justice Department's special counsel appointment on May 18. (Reuters) &gt; Then came the year-old recordings of Ryan and his colleagues, in which Ryan had told everyone else in the room to keep their mouths shut with their Russia-pays-Donald speculating. “No leaks,” he had said, following up with a sad et tu, Brute plea: “This is how we know we’re a real family.” &gt;  &gt;  &gt; His communications staff spent Thursday morning tweeting that Ryan had been joking — “Obviously a joke. Media needs to get a grip.” — in between trying to get Ryan’s followers stoked about taxes: “Who’s up for a big-time hearing on TAX REFORM at Ways and Means?” &gt;  &gt; Ryan tweeted, too. He tweeted about NAFTA. He tweeted a photo of himself shaking hands with the president of Colombia. &gt;  &gt; Earlier this week, some data analytics people analyzed several politicians’ Twitter accounts. They determined that Ryan was scientifically the most detested person in the survey. They determined this by calculating his ratio of retweets by other people (which are usually positive) to replies from other people (which are usually negative). &gt;  &gt; Ryan had a worse ratio than Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Mike Huckabee or Donald Trump. &gt;  &gt; The agony of Paul Ryan! &gt;  &gt; Five years ago he was wonky hope of the Republican Party, the would-be boy wonder to Mitt Romney’s would-be president. Less than two years ago, the man was fervently courted into his current job by colleagues who were certain he could unite the GOP. He hated Trump back then. You could just tell. &gt;  &gt;  &gt; And now, just this week: The New York Post’s Page Six was reporting that cooking celebrity Sandra Lee would not appear on a “Fox &amp; Friends” segment with him because he literally made her feel nauseated. “What occurred to me is that we are both from Wisconsin,” she told the column. “And I realized he is the one thing from Wisconsin that I cannot tolerate or stomach.” &gt;  &gt; A newspaper from his home state published an editorial, “House Speaker Paul Ryan needs to be replaced with an adult.” &gt;  &gt; The congressman from the next district over remarked that Ryan “seems to roll over and want his belly rubbed by the president.”	dreammerr	t3_6c23a8

t3_6c23a8	t1_dhrbe4z	1495178278	If Trump is removed from office via impeachment, [and Pence for any reason is also removed](http://www.palmerreport.com/politics/mike-pence-appears-donald-trump-transition-team-member-caught-wiretap/2036/) (either from russian scandal or some separate scandal), Paul Ryan becomes the new president:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession  Maybe he is only *semi* miserable about that.  Newsweek discussed the possibility of an impeachment and also asked whether there was any chance Pence would also be impeached -- the response was no, because the only way to get enough votes to impeach Trump is if Republicans believe it will give them the conservative president they *really* want, the more predictable Pence. The GOP might in fact decide to sacrifice Trump in order to get a more "stable" GOP president, that article speculates. In comparing current happenings to the Nixon affair (Nixon faced a democratic congress not his own party turning on him), VP Agnew ended up being forced to resign under other criminal charges. Pence however is less likely (?) to face that kind of threat -- at least while Republicans hold a majority. The only way they will agree to an ouster of Trump is if they get Pence ... although with Paul Ryan in the wings for next up to bat, things could get more complicated.  A lot rides on what happens in 2018, and whether republicans are able to main control of Congress.	brashendeavors	t3_6c23a8

t3_6bv8tu	t1_dhrhjwv	1495194979	*A relevant comment in this thread was deleted. You can read it below.*  ----  &amp;gt; Just days before President Trump was sworn in, his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, reportedly blocked a military plan opposed by Turkey that was supposed to take aim against an ISIS group.  The plan that he reportedly blocked was to be carried out by Syrian Kurdish forces in Raqqa, a measure Turkey has long opposed.  Flynn, who was fired from his position in February, was registered as a foreign agent for $530,000 worth of lobbying work before Election Day.  Paperwork filed in March with the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration Unit said Flynn and his firm were voluntarily registering for lobbying from August through November that "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey."  The McClatchy news service reported that President Obama’s national security team asked for Trump’s approval on a plan to retake the Islamic State’s de facto capital of Raqqa, because it was more than likely to be carried out under his presidency.  Timelines distributed by members of Congress show that Flynn told then national security advisor Susan Rice to hold off, delaying the operation for months.  Trump eventually approved the plan, but only after Flynn had been fired in February for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other white House officials about his ties to Russia’s ambassador to the U.S.  It was only weeks later in March when Flynn disclosed to the Foreign Agent Unit Registration Unit of the Justice Department that he was paid for work that “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.”  News about Flynn's activity comes amid intense scrutiny over his and other Trump associates' potential contacts with Russia.

It was a beautiful thing. I mean, they started punching back. … In the good old days, this doesn't happen because they used to treat them very, very rough.

But today, they walk in and they put their hand up and put the wrong finger in the air at everybody, and they get away with murder, because we've become weak." - Donald Trump, March 9, 2016  "Part of the problem and part of the reason it takes so long is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore. Right? And they're being politically correct the way they take them out. So it takes a little bit longer.

Mr. Trump, who dislikes spending the night away from home and has been adapting to life at the White House, has rarely ventured far from the Executive Mansion or his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida during his first 85 days in office. He has not strayed west of the Mississippi River, appearing at public events in only seven states and eschewing trips overseas. He is planning to travel to Wisconsin on Tuesday, and his first international trip is scheduled for next month, when he is to visit Brussels and Italy for meetings with world leaders.  By contrast, President Barack Obama had made public appearances in nine states and taken three overseas trips by this point in his presidency, and was beginning his fourth journey abroad. And President George W. Bush had stopped in 23 states by mid-April during his first year in office and also visited Canada."	Wario_Chalmers	t1_dhru2ps

t3_6c5215	t1_dhrx7w3	1495214609	That's probably because Trump himself has said and done things that warrant four times as much negative coverage.   &gt;Such is the case with Trump. There haven't been many big successes to speak of in his first 100 days, and from there, his penchant for controversy and the objective disorder in his administration tend to more than fill the vacuum.  &gt;Notably, Harvard defines negative coverage as “stories where the actor is criticized directly” and “stories where an event, trend, or development reflects unfavorably on the actor.” When you do controversial things — which polls show a huge amount of things Trump does are — you get criticized by certain people. And when you promise to accomplish amazing things and the results contradict all that you promised, it's difficult to cover that as a win.  &gt;Trump could offset that if he were succeeding legislatively, but none of the pieces of major legislation he has promised have passed, and his biggest executive actions have been highly controversial and, in three cases, been halted by the courts.  ... &gt;If there was one outlet you'd expect might be positive about Trump, it would be Fox News. The conservative-leaning cable network created a cottage industry of skeptical coverage of Obama the last eight years, and it's certainly been less tough on Trump than the others.  &gt;Yet if you look at its positive-vs.-negative coverage, according to the Harvard study, a majority — 52 percent — has been negative.  &gt;It's fair to point to specific stories and narratives in the media that aren't fair to Trump. We should all be constantly asking ourselves these questions. But the fact that coverage of Trump isn't positive-leaning even on Fox pretty much says it all.	i-am-sancho	t3_6c5215

They do not represent the views and opinions of 300+ million Americans. We have our problems. We have our racists. We have our hate groups. There is no denying it. I can tell you however, that the vast majority of Americans are good and decent people who are tolerant and care about their neighbors and communities regardless of their ethnicity, race, religion, etc. Lunatics and haters are all over the world. We have ours for sure, but there are more good than bad people. Please understand the speech Trump is about to give may have been written by one of the lunatics.	toughshit	t3_6c5e7o

If it isn't already, it certainly will be when a bunch of methane starts being released from the melting permafrost. As the scientist says in the youtube video, it really wouldn't take much, and she predicts extremely dangerous conditions within “only a matter of decades."   I guess thank capitalism, the corrupt and climate change denying politicians, and baby boomers (?).  Will we find a way to mitigate the damage and stop the warming? I really hope so.	kutwijf	t1_dhryye0

t3_6c7n0s	t1_dhsnqd1	1495248265	Actually I hadn't watched it, however you have convinced me that I should. So I will. Sorry people just downvoted your question.  It's pretty standard for a Presidential Weekly Address. He reads off a script that narrates a carefully crafted message intended for public consumption. It's nothing explosive, it's nothing that isn't already widely known, and there is a clear summary that can be made. Compare it with Obama's [first Weekly Address from 2009](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDfpd8GV9dI).  - Here, the President is going to 3 locations "in the spirit of unity". To do this he chooses what he believes are the cultural centers of the three Abrahamic religions:  1. Saudi Arabia - Islam *"The heart of the Muslim world," as Trump puts it* 2. Jerusalem - Judaism 3. Vatican City - Catholicism *Does Trump think the Catholic church represents *all* of Christianity?* 4. *Did he forget about Hinduism? Taoism? Buddhism? Every other non-Abrahamic religion? Well, I guess I should give him a pass because he also forgot every other non-Catholic form of Christianity.*  - Trump mentions a meeting with the leader of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas, which is aligned with [long standing US policy towards that conflict](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/Direct_talks_in_Sharm_El_Sheikh%2C_Egypt%2C_on_September_14%2C_2010_2.jpg).  - Trump is meeting with NATO and the G7. Frankly I do not think Trump knows why the G7 *is* the G7 and [not the G8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Eight#Russia.E2.80.B2s_participation_suspension_.282014.29).  Unfortunately Trump cannot stay on-message permanently, so we'll see how the next week of international travel goes for our 45th President. I have faith that our world is currently more willing to accept incompetence than serious violent conflict.   We also have the US news media releasing daily bombshells about Trump's campaign's shady contacts with the Russian government, so we can look forward to our special snowflake President getting triggered over that.   Should be a fun week!	4DUCK2TAPE0	t1_dhsk24t

The EPA is for protecting the environment and I don't see how anyone who's been anywhere green trees are found can possible want all that to be less protected. Its made even worse by the fact that a few republicans are creationist, that means they don't want to protect what (they think) God made.

I wish there was more substance and less vitriol because I really do listen to, and enjoy, a well written explanation and/or argument.  So much of the dialogue is pedestrian, predictable and far too near-sighted to be effective. Sadly.   Anyway, thanks for this little microcosm of self reflection.

Sort of like that blue-black dress thing, only with the fate of the world at stake.

t3_6c92bh	t1_dhsxdml	1495268296	&gt; The market is irrational  Not really, the market tends to be emotional, but not irrational. What this means is that when stock brokers are optimistic they bet on the future, when they are scared they bet against it, but the bets within these categories are made rationally based on thorough modeling of stock prices and market trends. The thing that changes in the model due to emotional states is how large people assume the risk to be, which affects stock pricing upwards during low risk and downward during high perceived risk.  Laymen investing in the markets are irrational though. They're generally no better than a gambler at a casino thinking he's going to beat the house at roulette.	SunTzu-	t1_dhsws9n
t3_6c92bh	t1_dhsxfba	1495268440	I mean, Trump has been mostly ineffectual. They just bet on congress being able to still pass pro-business legislation, but they wrongly priced in the incompetence spillover from the Trump admin and the fractures within the GOP.	SunTzu-	t1_dhswfq2

The Freedom Caucus will not fund infrastructure anyway so they are even less likely to get it done themselves.  Trump seems to have no interest in reaching across the aisle.    Tax reform is also dead, the Treasury isn't even staffed to write the proposal.    At this rate, we'll be lucky if we get a proper budget.	zryn3	t1_dhswfq2

Diplomatic relations [aren't the only reason](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/306990-trump-appeared-to-register-eight-companies-in-saudi-arabia) why Trump didn't ban Saudi Arabia.  The majority of the world doesn't get its news through the internet. Surely newspapers will carry transcripts or summaries. In any case, Trump can't hope to "reset relations" with people who have never heard of him or his policies, so it's not even a point to argue.    You can bet certain that American Muslims will be interested in what he has to say, since they're being adversely affected by Trump's policies and the growth of Islamophobia in the West.

Then, consider how little COST the insurance operators in CA would be having as it removes most of the layers of marketing, lobbying, accounts receivable, etc which would no longer focus on this market.

Maybe I'm just too much of an optimist these days, but I'm willing to see a ramp on my personal income taxes to cover the medical needs of myself and my neighbors where possible.   It's less risky than me instead being "insured" and thus "bankrupt" from an "emergency room visit" that happens to be "out of network" and thus costs "$18,000" plus an "ambulance fee" that measures several $1000 more, on a credit card, plus "now having a pre-existing condition" or some other nonsense that makes ever actually USING INSURANCE untenable.	cardfire	t1_dht3s6k

And it will only get worse as automation continues to ramp. At best, saving a "we push dollar figures around as 1's and 0's" firm will seek to remove as much of the "operational overhead"--all those squishy humans--from the balance sheets as possible.   But (a ) insurance companies will not completely fold, and will still be providing the care for non-residents visiting California.  (b) These existing employees are generally not being paid enough  as far as I'm concerned. I haven't heard of a profit-sharing Insurance company that actually values their administrative staff, in a society where the middlemen and entry-level workers are all VASTLY undervalued and all that wealth is captured at the higher end. When worker productivity has risen exponentially and wages have not, I can't take too seriously the arguments of "but then there will be fewer jobs to go around."  I tend to lean towards that crazy, Star Trek post-scarcity utopian fever dream where people receive enough basic income so that they're not dying in the streets, and then us over-achievers that want more out of this life can work to build or earn more...  And I'm not afraid of us landing at that goal too soon. There's still plenty of work to be done.	cardfire	t1_dht6rss

"It's going to reduce the quality of care. We think it will restrict access to care, and it will be incredibly disruptive to all the Californians who currently get health care coverage through their employer."  How will it reduce quality of care? The hospitals will still be paid, just not by the insurance companies. Arguably, that will mean hospitals will make more money since the middleman is cut out. Are you saying that hospitals will only provide quality care if there is an insurance industry? Because that is fucking dumb and a breach of the Hippocratic oath. As I understand it, single payer will require hospitals to provide a set of services that the State will pay for (basically all necessary medical, dental, vision; elective stuff is not usually covered). That is all most people want. If you want more, ***go buy insurance***. But I don't see how single payer will reduce quality of care.   Oh, and you think it will *reduce access to care*? Ok, asshat now we know you're just a paid dissembler. Single payer gives EVERYONE access to health care and you think it will somehow magically reduce access? Maybe you mean access to insurance plans. Well guess what? WE NEVER WANTED YOUR FUCKING SCAMS IN THE FIRST PLACE! When your job is to find reasons not to pay for a procedure, be it because of pre-existing conditions or outside-of-the-scope or you just not wanting to pay, **despite that the insured has been paying you for security, then you are running a fucking scam, a protection racket. You force your own customers into bankruptcy by so disputing claims, often when that family is grieving or under immense stress.   How do you people sleep at night?  As to disruption with employer plans, I can see that being a salient point, but I'm willing to go through the inconvenience if it means single payer.   Basically what I'm saying is: this guy can go fuck himself.	Averagejoeqpublic	t1_dht30vk

t3_6c9xsv	t1_dht9lk5	1495295709	I had long wait times with the private insurance I paid $800 a month for (me and two kids), plus deductibles, while working. Now I'm low income while self-employed and I can say hands down that we get better care under Medi-Cal than under any  private insurance I've ever paid for. It's glorious to see $0.00 come up at the pharmacy. In the past 2 years my family has had 3 ER visits, 2 hospitalizations and several urgent care visits, regular doctor visits, a pediatric GI specialist for my daughter, etc. all at no cost (other than all those taxes I paid for a couple of decades).  It upsets me that people who are working their asses off (like I was) struggle with medical care (like I did). It is this absolutely crazy sense of relief and freedom when you're not one accident or illness away from losing everything.	70ms	t1_dht7gxr

Human rights organizations are justifiably up in arms over the arrangement. Saudi Arabia is deeply involved in Yemen’s civil strife, and while all sides in Yemen’s war are guilty of gross humanitarian abuses, Saudi Arabia’s military operations have caused far more than their share of civilian casualties and war misery. Currently, seven million people in Yemen are confronting starvation because of the war.	treerat	t3_6cazea

t3_6c9xsv	t1_dhtaigk	1495296982	Taxing weed would provide nowhere near enough income to cover universal healthcare. That would be, by far, the largest item on the budget. It would require a general taxation scheme and for that reason, absent a complete restructuring of the US taxation system, will have to be done federally, even though I think that's a vastly inferior approach.  Honestly, people advocating for legalization of weed because of its tax benefits are brewing pretty weak tea. Weed should be legal because it doesn't harm anyone and criminalizing it is obscene, not because it has some benefits for cancer patients and could produce a minor source of revenue.	jamesroberts	t1_dht9o0i

t3_6c9xsv	t1_dhtb0p1	1495297682	Agreed; the only way would be to reduce federal taxation and allow states to raise taxes as they see fit. While this would have very harsh consequences for places like West Virginia, it would permit for a much more dynamic form of governance. While states could raise taxes now, to do so would be insane, as it would be so far beyond optimal levels of taxation that any person or company with the means to relocate would do so.  It would be amazing if progressives could seize on this idea as they'd find common cause with the likes of Ted Cruz here. We'd all get along better and states like California and New York would have vastly increased funding and could resolve issues of local importance, like public transportation, rather than a federal government that doles money out to constituencies that are comparatively economically irrelevant. Conservative states would be free to provide no services whatsoever, and citizens could draw clear comparisons between the different social welfare systems envisioned by different states.   It's not a stretch to say this was the original vision of the country and that by nationalizing everything we've made states dependent on the federal government.	jamesroberts	t1_dhtass5

I mean, whenever I hear Bernie Sanders speaks about this issue, it sounds like he thinks there are only two healthcare systems in the world. Politicians who want single payer should elaborate about what else would be affected other than the insurance companies. Are they going to copy the Scandinavian model? To be fair, countries within Scandinavia does things differently but almost every hospital is state owned which has the worst result in perfomance as well treatment of workers compared to privatized hospitals.	blackwhiteperro	t1_dht9yyt

The exodus is lower-income individuals. While it might be argued they shouldn't be pushed out, the departure of these individuals doesn't really spell doom for the local economy. Also, Austin does a great job of attracting talent, but I think it's a stretch to say it's becoming the new Tech hub of the country.    That said, I agree with you that all things being equal, people and companies will move to where taxes are lower. Of course, a decentralized national government would require companies to provide perks: if California provided taxpayer-funded healthcare, there would no longer be a need for companies in California to pay for health insurance, freeing up a huge portion of their monthly expenses. Companies in states without that would be compelled to compete, and the results of that would be hard to foresee.  Either way, though, it seems like a win to me: competition is always a good thing, whether it be between states or companies, and moving toward that vision would be tremendous.

t3_6cbm8k	t1_dhtgo7p	1495305671	Yeah. But unfortunately, that's where it goes. Every time  the far right rears its ugly head, this sort of thing starts. They're content to prey upon the stupid and the meek and the angry, implying that if WE were in power...we'd  do what they're doing right now.  Historically, that's all they have ever done. So when they protest, it's with black dolls hanging from makeshift gallows, and West African culture applied to someone born in the US, or shooting up a planned parenthood, or blowing up a government building, or inciting federal police by waving rifles and firing upon them then complaining when you're killed by them as a result.  And when leftists protest, a few people start breaking things and the far right government says "We're going to arrest EVERYONE who was there and charge all of you with felonies."  I think perhaps they might start to try *killing* fascists instead if they're going to spend the same amount of time in prison anyway.  And they'd be right to do it.	ChaoticGoodEconomics	t1_dhtflv7

While I'm sure some Chicago school zealot is more than happy to say deregulation inevitably results in greater human happiness, there's reason to believe that healthcare, particularly end-of-life car, is resistant to normal market forces, and that's putting aside questions of the fairness of having income determine availability to a minimum level of healthcare.

California is one of the most desirable markets for real estate and the wealthiest denizens, at least as far as I see as an outsider, certainly do not need another helipad or yet more pampering. They pretty much own towns like Malibu and parts of Silicon Valley and perhaps it is time their bubble was burst: you cannot live in a gated community hoarding your money like a packrat but give nothing back.  For decades, the middle class and poor have been squeezed and squeezed and squeezed and now there is nothing left in their pockets.    Maybe it is time to tell the insanely rich of California that this is the price of trying to evade taxes any way they can for so long.  A rewritten tax code where inheritance taxes are higher and MUST be paid. A business tax on companies with more than 500 employees. Property taxes on houses valued at over $1,000,000.

If they didn’t return the blue approval slip, senate tradition said that the judge didn’t get approved. Republicans want to narrow the blue slip tradition to a smaller group of federal judicial appointments, so as to lessen the power of Democratic senators over them.

t3_6cd8qr	t1_dhtqlfp	1495320655	Quiet Saturday so far. This is looking like a major story though.   &gt;The House Intelligence Committee, which is examining possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, made its request in a letter on May 9. Mr. Caputo, who lives near Buffalo and spent six months on the Trump team, worked in Russia during the 1990s and came to know Kremlin officials. He also did work in the early 2000s for Gazprom Media, a Russian conglomerate that supported President Vladimir V. Putin.  &gt;Mr. Caputo has strongly denied that there was any collusion between him or anyone else on the campaign and Russian officials. He has also accused the committee of smearing him.  I can definitely see why the House wants to question him.	LuminousRaptor	t3_6cd8qr

It was my way of feeling like I had some sort of control on this situation. (Ron Howard voiceover: she didn't)    Anyway, Caputo's name came up a few times.     [I highly suggest you read this entire article. It's absolutely fascinating.](http://buffalonews.com/2016/03/05/the-radical-adventures-of-conservative-radio-host-mike-caputo/)   Some tidbits:    &gt;* Though friendly with senior Kremlin officials, he butted heads with his superiors at the U.S. State Department. The Washington Post reported in 1995 that Caputo, “an obscure adviser to the Russian election commission,” got his phone, fax and office keys confiscated for refusing to support a State Department position to the media.    &gt;* He co-founded Rainmaker, a PR firm for budding telecom and Internet companies based in Washington, D.C., but also worked for Russians on this side of the Atlantic. He helped President Vladimir Putin weather U.S. government criticism for taking over an independent TV station.    &gt;* When Forbes Magazine correspondent Paul Klebnikov was shot to death in Moscow in 2004, Caputo penned a Washington Post column decrying the “brutal billionaires” of Russia and one in particular, Boris Berezovsky.   &gt;Soon after, Caputo said he started getting death threats. So he bought a tugboat and armed himself with a .40-caliber Glock. Off the Florida coast for much of the next five years, he let his hair grow, rarely wore shoes and ran his PR office from his boat with a laptop and a phone. He kept a white parrot as company.   &gt;His PR stunts included hiring a guy in a chicken suit to stand outside the office of a Miami senator who refused a debate invitation. He also hired women dressed as strippers to bring bad press to a proposed constitutional amendment in Florida.    &gt;* The large skull ring Caputo wears on his right hand speaks to his roots. He can offer insightful political observations one moment, then in the next, make crude sexual references to a critic’s mother online.   &gt;Caputo recently labeled Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz “cowardly” and called a promoter for Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz a “stupid bitch” on Twitter.

t3_6cddd0	t1_dhtuuav	1495327292	Here's a shitty ELI5 no one asked for:  An atom has different orbits of electrons around their nuclei. Think of it like the sun with all the planets around it. In quantum mechanics, or real life at a super-microscopic scale, electrons can move between multiple orbits by instantaneously jumping [from one orbit to another](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/50878/file-31635400-jpg/images/quantum_leap.jpg). So in the case of the solar system, it's kind of like Mars instantaneously entering the orbit that Earth is on without actually traveling the distance. That's a quantum leap in short - a jump without traveling between two points (or orbits) in space. This happens all the time in reality and is subjected to [Paul's Exclusion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle).	WowWaitaMinute	t1_dhtro9h

t3_6cfi48	t1_dhua03a	1495357687	&gt; Was this the family that sent the cease and desist, or their spokesperson?  As per the article it was the family's lawyer, Joseph Ingrisano. The spokesperson is Brad Bauman.   I'm sure the family hasn't publicly stated they approve of the lawyer either. Because why would they, exactly? You're implying that the DNC has shoved a spokesperson on a grieving family that they actually don't want. That's a huge accusation and I actually think the burden of proof goes there, not the other way around.	assuser	t1_dhu9ppw
t3_6cfi48	t1_dhua5ol	1495358207	Okay, let's break down your original post.  &gt; Was this the family that sent the cease and desist, or their spokesperson?   From the Article:  *The family of slain Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich is threatening legal action...*  *A lawyer for the Rich family sent a cease-and-desist letter Thursday to Rod Wheeler — a private investigator and Fox News contributor who had been working on behalf of the family.*  The family has also never said they approve of this lawyer. Is this suspicious to you as well? The entire fucking point of a spokesperson is so they can talk to the media on your behalf so you don't get bothered by the conspiracy-mongering fools, as much as that is possible in this day and age.   &gt; It's important to note their spokesperson was appointed to them by the DNC, and it's someone who has worked closely with the Clintons for a number of years. The family has also never publicly stated they approve of this spokesman.   So you're saying the employer of their murdered son gave them a spokesperson, and this is bad how exactly? That seems like a lovely thing to do, especially seeing as how his murder got politicized pretty much instantly, and I'd assume the motives of the family and the DNC coincide in that respect, in trying to protect the family from the crazies and trying to maintain the reputation of their staff/family member. Win/win situation, imho.  *accusation at the address of poster removed here*	Sulimonstrum	t1_dhu9wc2

t3_6cfi48	t1_dhucv53	1495366997	There may be no publicly released evidence that proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt, but there have been a lot of people on Trump's team that had failed to disclose their relationships &amp; meetings with Russian officials.  That, in addition to purported leaks claiming collusion and obstruction of justice, makes it, at the very least, worth looking into.  On the other hand, we have the Seth Rich story, where the "source" of the information recanted his story within a day and said he was just repeating claims Fox News had reported.  He admitted having no evidence.  Law enforcement has denied any links to Wikileaks.  His own family have denied the story.    The fact that this Seth Rich story has taken off as a diversion tactic is evidenced by how you can't take criticism of one story without bringing up the other.  The truthfulness of either story does not depend on the veracity of the other.  But only one of the stories warrants further investigation.	Manticore416	t1_dhucbrb

Like I said, she doesn't need to seek attention.   Actually, the feminist movement has done a disservice to at-home moms. After I left the workforce, I heard the phrase "just a mom" way too many times! It's like society expects women to work outside the home and also bear the primary responsibility for child rearing. And most women do it! It is refreshing to see someone like melania trump proudly state that being a mom is the most important thing she does. I feel the same way! People ask me about going back to work, and all I can think is, when my husband died and my kids were teens....i can't imagine not being there for them, working the kind of hours I used to work. Days would go by and I wouldn't see my kids. I was paying ppl to raise them for me. In a way my disability was a blessing bc it enabled me to be with them.

She also said he is focused on much bigger issues so why do ppl keep "leeching on" to this topic? Let's talk about jobs, the economy etc and his plans to improve those. I think she is very well spoken. Notice she does not get upset.   The second video was even more telling. She was in a very difficult position and handled it with grace. She seemed very honest when she said her husband doesn't talk that way, and I'm sure he doesn't, in public situations....but she was right, it was "boy talk" and he was "egged on" by billy bush. (The same thing happened with trump on Howard stern btw). She had a very good point.

t3_6cii9c	t1_dhv106d	1495403004	It was enough that a member of the house judiciary committee tweeted he was reading up on the impeachment process.  And since trump's lawyers are reading up on it as well it might have been.  That said, you may be right, but an impeachment petition can come from many sources including a court indictment.    It's a rumor so I'm not going to dis you because you don't believe but is the report possible?  Yes.  Is it probable?  We don't know.

If you think the DNC's process was rigged, if you think Bernie Sanders should have been the rightful nominee, then that's your business to feel. But quite honestly, it's a hair short of full blown conspiracy theory.  The process wasn't rigged. Did many people in the Democratic party and within the DNC favor Hillary? Yeah. Duh.  Let's see...one of the most famous Democratic politicians in the last half century, the most popular and successful woman politician in US history, wife of a popular President, a person openly supported by the current popular President (Obama), and a person who has spent her life raising how many millions and millions of dollars for Democrats, while also working to advance the Democratic cause, OR...  A guy who, while he has good ideas, was never a Dem, and immediately went back to independent status after the race.  Hmm...why did so many Dems favor Hillary? I wonder.  By the way, if any response of yours contains anything similar to the BS I STILL hear of "my hands are clean, I did the right thing" or something about your conscience or whatever, I will literally throw up on my computer so hard it will travel via the web and splatter on this thread.  You have a megalomaniac, the closest to a dictator we've had in a generations, sitting in the White House, destroying any progress towards any god damn idea Bernie had, and you still want to piss in the wind about a rigged process?

t3_6cjbs4	t1_dhv43h2	1495407368	Bullshit.  * Even Bernie said she won 'fair and square.'  * Bernie got his ass kicked in a massive 12% landslide in the primary because voters overwhelming determined HRC was the better candidate. Morons relying on buh mah polls said he would win against trump can't answer the fact Bernie was never attacked. Not only does he have a history of saying the most batshit crazy things, like calling the US a banana Republic while praising Venezuela's economy which is currently an apocalyptic nightmare, his policies were going to raise taxes on EVERYONE. The GOP was dying to run against him because they would have rolled that out and crushed him in a massive landslide in the general.  * It's clear Trump only faceplanted over the finish line with Russia's help to steal the election from the American people. There are multiple wide scale Federal Criminal and counterintelligence investigations into his collusion with Russia. The overwhelming majority of Bernie supporters voted for HRC and joined her campaign.   * HRC voted 93% of the time like Bernie. With her support, the Dems adopted 90% of his platform and are fighting for women's healthcare rights, lgbt rights, civil rights; were going to roll out a $206B renewable energy stimulus to make the US the clean energy super power and a $275B infrastructure plan to create solid working class jobs. They were going to make college tuition free, and massively expand civil service to allow students to participate in public service programs to learn about government and pay down their student debt.   * HRC was going to appoint Joseph Stiglitz, the nobel laureate who **coined the phrase 'the 99%'** to a senior economic post. She was using his studies in her campaign speeches. He wrote [*Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy*](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/rewriting-rules-report/) a 600 page policy roadmap to level the playing field for working Americans and small businesses. She was committed to providing universal healthcare. The Dems are responsible for the economic recovery and she was on track to broaden and strengthen the recovery for the middle class.

t3_6cjbs4	t1_dhv55lh	1495408991	LOL!

He would have lost by an even larger margin if he'd dropped out when it was obvious he had no chance, like candidates have historically.  * Even constituencies he said he was fighting for didn't come out for him, but instead came out for HRC because she's actually been fighting for them most of her career, while Bernie didn't bother to engage them until he needed them.   * The bottom line is real voters took a look at Bernie and he didn't have credibility because he he hasn't accomplished anything and was promising things even he didn't know how he was going to deliver.   * Even Bernie said she won 'fair and square,' campaigned his heart out for her, and most of his staff and supporters joined her campaign.

It's also laughable you're so completely uninformed about the Dems.  * Look at the [voting record] (https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2pwhvt/the_differences_between_the_democratic_party_and/). The GOP has voted every single time to block campaign finance reform, undermine the economic recovery, block unemployment compensation, block Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform, prevent consumer protection, destroy the ACA, repeal women's health rights, continue discrimination, prevent closing Guantanamo, block immigration reform, side with the coal companies, attack environmental protections, block student loan affordability, and end net neutrality...Every-single-time the only thing that stood in their way are the Dems. The Dems just shut down Republicancare which would have ripped healthcare away from 24 million Americans to give the 1% a massive payout. The Dems just made sure an independent prosecutor was appointed. The Dems are making sure that the Kremlin doesn't take over the White House.  * The fact is the overwhelming majority of Bernie supporters, volunteers, and staff supported and voted for HRC.

And I'd dare say the World Council of Families, based in Illinois, can be considered a terrorist group considering they've openly worked with Putin's associates to help spread anti-LGBTQ propaganda in places like the country of Georgia, including speeches that say it is allowable by scripture to murder homosexuals, and they believe violence against homosexuals is acceptable because, as their leader put it, "Homosexuals are the Velvet Mafia, violent provocateurs against our values."

Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. I rise today with a sense of responsibility and duty to the people who have elected me, a sense of duty to this country, a sense of duty to the Constitution of the United States of America. **I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to call for the impeachment of the President of the United States of America for obstruction of justice.** I do not do this for political purposes, Mr. Speaker. I do this because I believe in the great ideals that this country stands for — liberty and justice for all, the notion that we should have government of the people, by the people, for the people. I do it because, Mr. Speaker, there is a belief in this country that no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, our democracy is at risk. Mr. Speaker, this offense has occurred before our very eyes. It is perspicuous. It is easily — easy to understand. Mr. Speaker, we're talking about a president who fired the FBI director who was investigating the President for his connections to Russian involvement in the President's election. Mr. Speaker, this is not about the President firing the FBI director because he was investigating someone else, it's because the FBI director was investigating the president himself. And after firing the director, he went on to let us know that he considered the investigation when he fired him. And then he tweeted language that would be intimidation or a warning, an admonition very strong to say the very least. Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow this to go unchecked. The president is not above the law. It is time for the American people to weigh in. Mr. Speaker, the American people are a part of this democracy. This is a participatory democracy. The American people don't participate on Election Day only. The American people participate daily, and this is your day to act. This is your day. I'm speaking to the American people. It is time for you to act. It is time for you to let us know where you stand. I’ve seen a poll that indicates that a majority now of those who are being polled are for impeachment. And I’ve seen another poll that says a plurality of those. Whether it's a majority or plurality, let's let the America people weigh in. The American people should speak up, speak out, stand up so that we will get a sense of what the American people want. This is not something to be taken lightly. And I do not. I think that this is one of the highest callings that a member of congress has to address. I believe that this is where your patriotism is shown, where you demonstrate to the American people where you really stand. So I take this stand. It's a position of conscience for me. And I have not talked to another person in congress about this. Each member of congress has to make his or her own decision. So this is not about my encouraging other people to do things other than the American people. This is about my position. This is about what I believe. And this is where I stand. I will not be moved. The President must be impeached. For those who do not know, impeachment does not mean that the president will be found guilty. It simply means that the House of Representatives will bring charges against the president. It's similar to an indictment but not quite the same thing. Once the president is impeached, then the Senate can have a trial to determine the guilt or innocence of the President. Whether he is guilty or not guilty, to be more specific. But the House of Representatives has a duty that it can take up and that is of impeachment. I stand for impeachment of the president. How can you weigh in? You can contact my good friends over at Free Speech for People and at this organization they have a petition, the petition would allow you to weigh in and become a part of the nearly one million people who have already said the president ought to be impeached. You can weigh in at ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow.com. And believe me, if a plurality of the people are saying it now, and that's the poll that I really put my emphasis on, the one that says plurality believes that the president should be impeached, more than 40%, I think that can grow. I assure you once you weigh in, American people, there will be a difference in the attitudes about this. I want to thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity because but for this opportunity you might not hear my voice. I am a voice in the wilderness, but I assure you that history will vindicate me. I assure you that righteousness will prevail. I assure you that no lie can live forever and truth crushed to earth will rise again. I yield back my time.	ibzl	t1_dhv2lx6

I mean, Jefferson and Adams in the fourth national election were fucking awful to each other. And literally, only rich white men - the Trump's of their time - had a shot at the Presidency or really any government office. So yeah, it's exactly what we were founded on. It sucks. We all get that. You don't burn down a house to get rid of an infestation though.  Write in who you think is best. Your vote. Your choice. But you clearly have no idea how your ideological purity affects real people. I've never seen a candidate that met all my criteria. And I never will. Cause we're not getting President Bartlett. But yeah, I think if I have two choices, I'm going to be a rational actor. Look at the shit we're in now - makes me miss the quaint days of Obama is a secret Muslim. Sure as hell wouldn't have these issues with Clinton as President.  But I'm sure you're not down in the shit like many of us, having to watch helplessly each day as more bullshit comes down from upon high to fuck over large swaths of people who don't deserve it. Uh oh, look at me, all frothy at the mouth.  PS - The central core of our economy and the location of our capital literally happen in a fucking backroom deal without input from anyone. Read a book. Or like, go see "Hamilton". And the party nominees used to be chosen by the party. Primaries didn't exist until 1920. Before, the party literally chose the nominee.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_primary#Background	neanderthal85	t1_dhvfaaw

Takes longer and does have a positive side effect on 2018, but it also maximizes the amount of people that are convicted and limits the possibility of everything blowing over.

What a fucking tragedy, the people in charge of investigating the facts tend to fall prey to the trend of facts having a liberal bias  (By the way, it's a play on the joke of "as we all know, facts have a liberal bias" and, given how journalists usually attempt to dig up facts...)	cavecricket49	t3_6clsi0

t3_6clsi0	t1_dhvmj7t	1495438387	Criticism and negative coverage isn't bias if it is warranted.  The media basically applauds Trump if he manages to read a teleprompter speech without ad-libbing insanity into it, so they actually aren't "biased."	AgoraiosBum	t3_6clsi0
t3_6clsi0	t1_dhvmjep	1495438402	...not as bias as his policies are against the people and world. Coverage should be way worse than it is, this administration are the most dangerous and corrupt criminals yet to be in charge of the US government and world by extension, so objective reality has an extreme 'bias' against Trump because him and his administration are absolute shit.      Being a mortal danger to the civilized world is not small affair... now more than ever we need the media to stand up for what is right and cover the news objectively without worrying about catering to false balance and the other excuses used to normalize this garbage by major propaganda outlets.	cavortingwebeasties	t3_6clsi0

t3_6clsi0	t1_dhvmmx1	1495438673	I don't get the "positive coverage should be equal to bad coverage" thing, tbh. Using that logic we should demand 50% positive coverage and 50% negative coverage for any number of varying subjects, i.e. someone can not say rape is bad without also spending 50% of the time defending rape, or for every 50% of articles that have a 'negative tone' about beheadings by ISIS there should be 50% positive ones. False equivalency, and such. Report facts neutrally, and then the facts themselves will be either positive or negative depending on the reader.	Sulimonstrum	t3_6clsi0

t3_6ci77e	t1_dhvuwnw	1495459399	Well. Here's the thing about that. Donald never admitted to actually sexually assaulting anyone. In the access Hollywood tape he was bragging that famous ppl *can* do that. It very well may have just been crude locker room talk. When he was asked point blank about it, he denied actually doing that.   Melania said that's not the man she knows and dismissed it as "boy talk". She said the left wing media was hyping it (true) and that ppl should focus on the actual political issues facing the country. She also said he was "egged on", which he was (and has also been by Howard stern in the past. )  so what we actually know is that he makes crude jokes about such things, but we do not know that any of it is true.   The women who accused him had never said anything before and might have just been jumping on the bandwagon. Also remember bill Clinton was accused of philandering and cover ups and worse, but Hillary also stood by him and in some cases helped him. And America felt sorry for her. So why not melania?	rush42	t1_dhvs7q7

Now, I'm no fan of the current administration, but r/politics needs to get the fuck over themselves when it comes to Melania Trump. Y'all are all about women's rights, feminism, and liberal ideals etc. etc., *except* when it's a woman on the other team. It's like everyone can't get over the fact this woman had the audacity to own her sexuality and use it to improve her situation in life because only liberal women have that right. Doesn't anyone else remember that Trump was a Democrat when they married? That she most likely was also?   Quit shaming the woman. It's obvious she's in a situation she'd rather not be, and I actually have respect for her for doing it on her own terms instead of being the meek trophy-wife everyone seems to think she is. That being said, yes, she either needs to move to the White House or pay for her own damn security, but you've got a fucking ringer for women in the White House who is adored by conservative women.

t3_6cpbqw	t1_dhwcbdc	1495480443	The latest installment in the long-running Republican sabotage campaign against the ACA:  -----  &gt;The Trump administration's move Monday to avoid for 90 days — yet again — making a decision on a major court challenge to key Obamacare subsidies paid insurers by itself will alone add up to 20 percent or more to the price of individual health plans next year, experts said Monday.  &gt;Andy Slavitt, who until January oversaw Obamacare for the federal government, told CNBC that President Donald Trump has guaranteed higher insurance prices in 2018 by his indecision on what will happen to the $7 billion in subsidies insurers have counted on from the government.  &gt;"By not choosing, he's choosing," said Slavitt, former acting administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  &gt;Slavitt on Monday tweeted that a "19% Trump surcharge will be baked into 2018 premiums," which are being proposed in coming weeks because insurers will factor the uncertainty about the subsidies into their plan prices.  &gt;Slavitt also said that the uncertainty over the fate of so-called cost-sharing reduction payments will lead some insurers to abandon selling individual health plans altogether. "The most conservative thing is to leave the market," he said. The second most conservative thing, he added, is to price premiums as if the subsidies won't be paid.  &gt;...  &gt;Dave Dillon, a fellow of the Society of Actuaries, a group of experts that help set premium rates, said "gross premiums could increase significantly — in the 20-25 percent range" if insurers price in the potential loss of the subsidies for affected plans next year.  "Today's delay in committing to cost sharing payments will force millions of people across the country to pay 20 percent more for their coverage — a Trump Tax — solely because of the deliberate uncertainty created by the President and his allies. Instead of undermining our health care system, three-quarters of Americans want the President to make the Affordable Care Act work."	The-Autarkh	t3_6cpbqw

t3_6ci77e	t1_dhwd1rd	1495481271	Well, in the interest of fairness I will start off by saying that I also don't think Jacqueline Kennedy was very attractive either, despite America's fawning pity party for her. I will grant that she was a woman of class and tact, but I do not think she was attractive at all. Though I love Nancy Reagan dearly, nor was she attractive in her younger years. She was a complete sweetheart, and along with the rest of America - barring only the bitterest partisans - I loved her dearly. She was quite homely in spite of this. I personally found Laura Bush, in her younger years, to be quite pretty. She reminded me of a former sweetheart of mine.  As for women I'd rate at least a 7 or better, in no particular order:  My wife, Rachael Lee Cook, Zooey Deschanel, Zoë Saldana, Zoë Kravitz, Sanaa Lathan, Kristen Wiig, young Björk, Julia Stiles, Mila Kunis, Gabrielle Union, inexplicably, I find that Nicki Minaj makes my twig n berries sprout, Taylor Rooks, I'd give Rihanna all 13 screaming, throbbing, veiny millimeters of my manstick, and I guess maybe I'll close out with Thandie Newton.

If he came back from this trip and suddenly turned over a new leaf, fired most of his wolves-in-the-henhouse cabinet and replaced them with competent people, renounced his racist and xenophobic positions, and actually started trying to unite this country by doing what's best for ALL Americans then with God as my witness I'd get on the motherfucking Trump Train.

This doesn't even need to be true, just drown the reason for the Obamacare rate hikes in white noise and whataboutism, and tell people it will be cheaper.  Support for the Republican candidates increases because the average (white) voter will believe that their woes are still the fault of Obama and Obamacare.   I think this presidency shows you that people don't want logic...they want someone to root against and money out of their paychecks is reason enough. You start trying to explain subsidies and obstructionism and all the opponent has to say is, "I wouldn't have to obstruct it if it wasn't so terrible and took money out of the pockets of hard working Americans" and the GOP base will eat that up all day.	poppamatic	t3_6cpbqw

t3_6cq2o8	t1_dhwlc3b	1495491125	Well, he's got pretty broad powers.  The text of Article II:  &gt; **The President shall** be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states, when called into the actual service of the United States; he may require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in each of the executive departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices, and he shall **have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.**  So, there's the question that hasn't really been ruled on because there have been very few impeachments and even fewer rulings.  Is Flynn's charge in a case of impeachment as it's related to the president's own theoretical impeachment OR is it not an impeachment so not covered?    I think legally the people saying the president can't pardon Flynn would have a harder fight in court, but it's likely  Trump would be impeached for pardoning Flynn even by these republicans.

t3_6cqxci	t1_dhwsd7h	1495500148	Will it? I don't think Trumps approval ceiling is higher than 50%, at best.  He started out with 45% of the nation being utterly unwilling to even give him a chance to be president as president, they instantly disproved of the job and had a fundamental disagreement on the course of the nation. Unlike Bush, who started in the same situation, he didn't go up to 55% by February 20th. He was actually in decline by February 20th while the initial unsure 10% jumped to disapproving of him.   Maybe he can rally the lost initial supporters and some of those initial unsures, but he'll never rally that initial base of disapproval into approval, and a terrorist attack or war will only increase their hate of him.  and this assumes he doesn't botch the aftermath of the terrorirst attack and look like a massive ass instead of a commander in chief, which even Bush managed.

t3_6cs6gn	t1_dhx23ra	1495513037	The reason republicans want to push democrats into impeachment is because it will look premature and partisan, an overstep that would rally people against the democrats and have no chance of success without actual evidence of wrongdoing nor the votes in congress to support it.  The republicans would rather see the democrats go too far and fall flat, whereas the democrats want to prolong this russia media coverage and shitstorm to last indefinitely so it can cast a cloud over the entirety of Trump's administration. Their goal is a 4-8 year long Benghazi-style neverending investigation that keeps turning up new headlines on demand.  The democrats in congress aren't morons, they know they can't impeach Trump yet. Republicans know they can exploit the overzealous and hysterical leftwing base of support to put pressure onto democrats to push for impeachment, even if its self defeating. We saw this already in the nuclear showdown over Neil Gorsuch, where democrats were forced into filibustering the nominee despite no chance of success, handing McConnell a free pass on the *next* SCOTUS pick, all because they were scared their base would eat them alive if they allowed Gorsuch to be nominated without a bitter fight.  Democrats are more worried about losing their own seats than trying to take Trump's, so republicans have a fine chance to exploit the opposing base like the people on /r/politics and get them to push for a clinton-esque impeachment proceedings which blow up on the democrats and end the russia narrative once and for all.	orangutong	t1_dhx0ex7

Why don't we go with the [linked numbers from the Social Security Administration instead?](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/pdf_notes/note151.pdf)  &gt; While unauthorized immigrants worked and contributed as much as $13 billion in payroll taxes to the OASDI program in 2010, only about $1 billion in benefit payments during 2010 are attributable to unauthorized work. Thus, we estimate that earnings by unauthorized immigrants result in a net positive effect on Social Security financial status generally, and that this effect contributed roughly $12 billion to the cash flow of the program for 2010.

t3_6cs6gn	t1_dhx4bq6	1495517159	&gt;What options did Democrats have on the SC pick?  Two primary options. Either let gorsuch get nominated with no filibuster, or filibuster him. The result is that Gorsuch gets onto the SCOTUS either way. But in the "no filibuster" scenario, the dems will be attacked by their own rebellious base who will accuse the senators of bowing to Trump, and risk their own tails. They will fuel insurrections against them- facing primary opponents outflanking them on the left, being pulled farther left and hurting them in general elections, etc. In the "filibuster" scenario, they appease their base, but they hand Trump and McConnell a free pass on the nuclear option fight. Trump has 80%+ odds of getting at least one more SCOTUS nomination in just the rest of his first term alone between natural mortality rates and Kennedy and Ginsburg both wishing to retire. In the next fight, there will be no bitter debate over the nuclear option. And with Trump facing his own fractious far-right rebellion, and some moderates like McCain uneasy about rules changes, and unforeseen changes in the political landscape and a midterm election, Trump might have had a far harder time getting a nuclear senator in 2019 than he did in 2017.

"   They didn't hand anything to anyone. No matter which way they go, Mitch will still get his SC nominee.   So again, this wasn't an OPTION for democrats.    "Trump has 80%+ odds of getting at least one more SCOTUS nomination in just the rest of his first term alone between natural mortality rates and Kennedy and Ginsburg both wishing to retire."  That's pure speculation on your part or maybe wishful thinking.    "The result was a self inflicted loss for the democrats, they won't be able to obstruct the next fight."

They couldn't stop Gorsuch, but they could plan ahead to the next battle.  &gt;That's pure speculation on your part or maybe wishful thinking.  No its literally the odds. 80% just for mortality according to slate.com's rather morbid calculator, thats not including retirement:  http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/the_odds_of_another_supreme_court_justice_dying.html  80% for any scotus (57% for a liberal justice, 52% for a conservative). Kennedy and Ginsburg both want to resign, thats not included.  &gt;Again, that's not OPTIONAL for Democrats. Mitch have the power to do what he pleases because he has the MAJORITY. It wouldn't make a lick of difference WHEN he would change the filibuster rule.  It makes a huge difference. The nuclear fight was extremely contentious within the republican party and exposed making divisions. John McCain did his trademark "I am deeply troubled but will do it anyway". Donald Trump faces a rebellious far-right of his own, just like the democrats face a far-left, and given time the republican base may splinter. The midterms may change it. The nominee Trump puts forth might not make it through the hearings so untouched as Gorsuch did- anyone could get Bork'd.  There are a ton of factors that could give the democrats real leverage in the next fight based on the nuclear option, and they forfeited it, knowingly. I'm hardly the only person to point it out, lots of pundits and political analysts who know more than I do wrote about it in detail	orangutong	t1_dhx4nzl

t3_6cs6gn	t1_dhx5sme	1495520414	Gorsuch gets onto the court either way. What wasn't necessary was forfeiting the fight over the nuclear option without anything gained. It wasn't an inconsequential fight when there is a large wedge between republicans willing to vote on a scotus seat and republicans willing to vote for a senate rules change, something democrats could exploit- to hold up a future scotus seat, or force a more moderate compromise nominee, or just drive a wedge between republican moderates and the far-right that would cost them in an election.  The radical push from the democrat's base of support for a filibuster was short sighted and self defeating, but the democrat senators are *not* short sighted, they were just forced to weigh the value of a nuclear showdown in the future against the risks of defying their base. The world is made up of rational people choosing the lesser of two evils.	orangutong	t1_dhx48xa

You can't just keep saying how bad they are and ignore them, they have to be included in any conversation about peace there....Which by the way has been a very rare event in isreal for about 4000 years. ...Because they won't stop, ever, until they are satisfied they are getting something of what they demand. Which was in fact their home, taken by forCe, in good old middle East fashion. With help from America,  England and Europe.  The place is just rife with violence, always has been, the real key to peace there is taking religion out of the picture. Which means there probably never will be any.

Lawmakers say it helps turn the discussion away from their own foibles and allows them to paint Democrats as out of touch.  Makes a lot of sense.   Also impeachment needs 67 votes in the senate. So it is basically impossible. I wager Trump could truly shoot a person on 5th Avenue and the current senate would not impeach him. So as a political play talk of impeachment only makes sense if it helps Democrats win elections.	sapplylapply	t3_6cs6gn

Not all tabletop RPGs focus extensively on combat, and if you're playing an elaborate game of political intrigue and spying then charisma is essential while the ability to stab people really well is not.  If you're just muderhobo-ing your way between dungeons, it's not so useful.

t3_6cv0js	t1_dhxkzqr	1495551503	On October 14th, CNN accepted Donna Brazile’s resignation as a CNN contributor. (Her deal had previously been suspended in July when she became the interim head of the DNC.) CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate. We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.  - Lauren Pratapas  In an email dated March 5, 2016 — the day before a CNN debate in Flint, Mich. — Brazile sent Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri an email with the subject line, “One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash."  “Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint,” she wrote.

Anyone who's smart can tell that WikiLeaks is working directly for Russia and Trump, which is why they never release tidbits of info on the RNC or Trump communication.  And yeah, the Dems are a private party and can technically do whatever. Feeding debate questions, while slimy, wasn't big enough to affect the voting.  Do you have any actual evidence that the actions of the DNC affected the primary, or are you just continuing to feed into the delusion that a majority of the people preferred Bernie Sanders as a candidate, even though Hillary had 4,000,000 more votes.	throwawayacc69420666	t1_dhxkzqr

Any time there is any criticism of the DNC or any liberal on this sub it's met with a bunch of comments deflecting to Republicans and Trump.

Well, looking all the way back to last year, I recall Clinton worked overtime to campaign at polling places, vote counts magically changed and we were told to just keep moving in the primaries and it would get fixed after. Then there was the piles of votes that went uncounted, again we were told to just keep moving and let the lawsuits after the fact handle this.  The big promise was that there would be a time to reflect on this horrible primary process. This was part of that. The DNC even said that basically they don't have to be fair, they push the candidate that they want and everyone else can stand in line to eat a spoonful of shit.  "Oh, why don't you make your own party then" oh fuck off, that's even less likely to work than someone winning the DNC primary who wasn't cherry-picked.	fuck_all_you_people	t1_dhxkr5u

t3_6cvlhk	t1_dhxp279	1495556106	&gt; there is no evidence that Trump colluded with Russia or the Kremlin.   No, he certainly did not say that. Stop twisting this -- he said he wouldn't talk about any individuals outside of a classified setting. Further, he said HE personally did not see all the evidence. Saying "I have not seen" evidence is a far cry from "no evidence exists." Moreover, what do you think the purpose of an investigation is? It's to find evidence.   Why would you think we have all the evidence before  an investigation has been conducted? It's asinine to conclude that no evidence exists -- literally no one has said that, yet I keep seeing Trump supporters screeching that there's no evidence.	FuckfaceVonClownstix	t1_dhxoru8

Part of that is because people self select into homogenous communities. Liberals all on their own tend to concentrate into cities and leave the rural areas to a slight conservative advantages. Part of it is because there's significant disagreement over whether it's better to have competitive districts or districts that better represent subgroups.	indigo121	t1_dhxmifv

Surely you must be getting tired of saying some variation of 'just wait' just the same as I'm sure you were tired of hearing Clinton was guilty all election when Republicans were saying the same. More and more democrats are shying away from calling for impeachment and cliaming huge Russian interference because at this stage it looks like there is none or the very least nothing close to actually implicate Trump.

t3_6cu0ya	t1_dhxq1kv	1495557206	That's fine.  It's also really easy to do (and see) wrong.  I think what you describe is a good way to look at things --- to represent people based on a few factors like geography, socio-economics, etc and weight them.  What shouldn't happen is a weighting on one aspect alone.  This is where you end up getting districts that spread across multiple cities, and cities that get cut in pieces themselves.  It also leaves a very 'pick and choose' feel if you have a few very homogenous groups, and others that are not.	schlitz91	t1_dhxp2hw
t3_6cvlhk	t1_dhxq8mx	1495557425	It's amazing to me how blindly Trump supporters will try to turn partial quotes into reality, especially when Brennan wouldn't have been in a position to comment on the evidence anyway.  First off, he obviously can't disclose the amount of evidence that exists in an ongoing investigation.    Second, he was the director of the CIA, not the FBI.  The CIA is responsible for foreign intelligence ONLY, the FBI is responsible for domestic intelligence.  The FBI investigated the DNC hack and found that it was conducted by Russian hackers.  The CIA then investigated and found that those hackers were acting on Putin's behalf in order to help Trump win the election and disrupt our democracy.  Through that investigation, they found that suspected Russian spies had been in contact with people closely associated to Trump.  At this point, any investigation into Trump's people is entirely the FBI's jurisdiction.  So he wouldn't have been reviewing evidence as the FBI collected it anyway.    Third, he's been out of his role for 5 months.  So even if he did say that there isn't any proof or evidence (which he didn't), that would be excluding anything anyone found in the past 5 months.   Edit:  If I've misunderstood the intelligence agencies' roles or limitations someone please inform me of that.  I am quite certain that the CIA and FBI are just foreign and domestic counterparts of each other, but it's possible that I assumed that meant the CIA couldn't be aware of what the FBI was doing.	grabbitt	t1_dhxoru8

t3_6cvlhk	t1_dhxt6j4	1495560658	I don't think you understand how this works.  They can't show us evidence as they collect it.  They could have a tape of Trump talking with Putin about how they're gonna work together to take the White House and they could not - we won't know until the investigation is over.  Also, I don't think Trump will personally be implicated in the investigation of collusion with Russians to meddle in the election.  It's very possible he was a puppet and genuinely didn't realize that he was hiring people who were working with Russians to get him elected.  And if he had a hunch, why would he care?  Anyway, I think he's going to be impeached for all these things he's doing to obstruct justice.  Telling Comey to lay off Flynn and drop the investigation, telling the Russians that firing the nut job director of the fbi relieved the pressure of the russia investigation, telling Lester Holt that the Russia investigation played a role in his decision to fire Comey, asking the NSA and CIA directors to come forward and claim there isn't any evidence when they would never do that and weren't in a position to know that information anyway.  It's remarkably similar to Nixon, who (before he resigned) was going to be impeached for the tape of him telling the CIA to stop the FBI's investigation.  He wasn't going to be impeached for what everyone was investigating, he was going to be impeached for the cover-up.  And Trump is dumb enough to be supplying Mueller with lots of evidence of obstruction of justice when he might have gotten off scotch free had he just kept his mouth shut.	grabbitt	t1_dhxpony

They do not need to be rubbed in the faces of people who's ancestors were victims of policies that viewed them as property. The fact that those same folks have been marginalized and discriminated against since does not help.   There's also the fact that they were indeed traitors.   The southern states inability to evolve was the problem then ,and still is a problem today. It's evidenced by states like North Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi.

Each one possessed a stick of wood    Or so the story’s told.     &gt;Their dying fire in need of logs    The first man held his back    For of the faces round the fire    He noticed one was black.  &gt;The next man looking ‘cross the way    Saw one not of his church    And couldn’t bring himself to give    The fire his stick of birch.  &gt;The third one sat in tattered clothes.    He gave his coat a hitch.    Why should his log be put to use    To warm the idle rich?  &gt;The rich man just sat back and thought    Of the wealth he had in store    And how to keep what he had earned    From the lazy shiftless poor.  &gt;The black man’s face bespoke revenge    As the fire passed from his sight.    For all he saw in his stick of wood    Was a chance to spite the white.  &gt;The last man of this forlorn group    Did nought except for gain.    Giving only to those who gave    Was how he played the game.  &gt;Their logs held tight in death’s still hands    Was proof of human sin.

t3_6cxow2	t1_dhy653r	1495575104	This article should be called "Fox News Blocks Other News Sources On The Building's Firewall: What is Mueller Doing?"   Six days ago, the New York Times said this ([source](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/robert-mueller-special-counsel-russia-investigation.html)) :  &gt;As a special counsel, Mr. Mueller can choose whether to consult with or inform the Justice Department about his investigation. **He is authorized to investigate “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump,” according to Mr. Rosenstein’s order naming him to the post, as well as other matters that “may arise directly from the investigation.” He is empowered to press criminal charges, and he can request additional resources subject to the review of an assistant attorney general.**  So this is mostly an opinion piece from a guy that didn't read any news about this.	DPSnacks	t3_6cxow2
t3_6cxow2	t1_dhy655w	1495575106	And so it begins. This is the foreshadowing of the right's gameplan in the event that evidence of Trump-Russian collusion is made public. The narrative will be that colluding with an adversary to undermine an election by spreading misinformation and hacking political opponents is "not technically illegal". Potentially the most un-American thing a group of people have ever done, yes. Illegal, no. (Although isn't hacking private servers definitely illegal?)  Edit: Could this be why the Russians are also pushing the "civil war" narrative? A President revealed to be an oath-breaking, democracy-undermining traitor not being prosecuted or impeached because it's "not technically illegal" would lead to some serious, serious civil unrest.

t3_6cxow2	t1_dhy6itk	1495575557	What the actual fuck is he talking about?  Right now it looks like Flynn committed multiple felonies including lying to federal investigators and failing to register as a foreign agent.  It is starting to look like there is strong evidence Trump attempted to use his office to shut down the investigation (i.e. obstruction of justice).   While collusion itself might not technically be a crime, all of the things that go along with it are.  Examples of collusion that would be illegal.    * Paying Russian hackers to break into the DNC * Taking money or intelligence from a foreign power to influence US policy * Laundering money to hide payments  These are just the obvious ones.	nanaclifford	t3_6cxow2

t3_6cxow2	t1_dhy6l6r	1495575638	But it likely would be. Russian agents committed crimes through hacking, espionage, etc. If Trump colluded with them, he'd likely be a  co-conspirator or an accessory. These are bigly crimes when the underlying crime is also big.	workshardanddies	t1_dhy60xc

Right .. the entire DoJ and the FBI are oblivious, but you, Mr. Fox News Lawyer has it *all* figured out on a technicality!  Then he concedes that the DoJ and FBI, particularly career man Rod Rosenstein *maybe* knew what they were doing.  &gt; The only conceivable crime is a tangential one.  If it could somehow be shown that someone in the Trump campaign aided and abetted the hacking of the Democratic National Committee or the campaign of Hillary Clinton, then perhaps a criminal charge might be made.  Cool beans, right? The whole article is moot right? No, not just yet.  &gt; But as Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz told Fox News, “I’m sure that didn’t happen”.  **How can he be so sure?  Common sense**.  Ah common sense. That was the answer after all!  &gt; There is *no evidence the Trump campaign had the technical expertise to hack anything*.  Knowing about a computer theft or even verbally encouraging it is not enough under the law.  It requires an overt act that assists in the commission of the crime.  It appears that no one, including the Trump campaign, even knew about Russia’s hacking efforts until after they were accomplished and made public.  Lol, what a blowhard.

Also if the hacking is considered a cyber crime, colluding to commit a crime is a crime.   That being said, now there are a bunch of other crimes that may have been committed around the collusion. Lying on a security clearance is a crime, money laundering is a crime, obstruction of justice is a crime, lying under oath is a crime.   This may have also been why when they were initially talking about the collusion they made it clear it was an counter-intelligence investigation. Because even if a crime isn't committed, the intelligence agencies definitely want to know whenever a US citizen is speaking to Russian operatives (or operatives of any country)	kanst	t1_dhy6fa3

That being said, there are so many crimes alleged around the collusion that it doesn't matter if collusion is a crime or not. Obstruction of justice is a crime. So is lying under oath or on a security clearance. So is money laundering.  Also, the FBI investigation was a counter-intelligence investigation, their doesn't need to be a domestic crime for that. If a US citizen is meeting with foreign operatives and the FBI finds out, they are going to investigate that. Especially if those involved are in a presidential campaign.	kanst	t1_dhy7088

Hannity decided to jump on it and say he was going to fight for the truth no matter what, which while I disagree the battle I can somewhat respect the desire for the truth.  Except from his tweets about talking to his lawyers it seems his money earned by being a fox talking head was threatened and thus the truth doesn't matter and wishes of the family blah blah blah.  It makes this look even more clearly that to Hannity this was all a bid for ratings.  Which is a level of ghoulishness that I hope earns him a special place in hell.

At the time, Reagan was beginning to exhibit what his son Ron now describes as early signs of Alzheimer’s, and his age and acuity were becoming a central issue in the campaign.  &gt;&gt; Worse still, Bush had baggage: He was neck-deep in the Iran-Contra scandal that had secretly sent arms to Tehran and used the profits to fund an illegal war in Nicaragua. Ailes saw an opportunity to address both shortcomings in a single, familiar strategy – attack the media. Ailes inked a secret deal with tobacco giants Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds to go full-force after the Clinton administration on its central policy objective: health care reform.  &gt;&gt; Hillarycare was to have been funded, in part, by a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes. To block the proposal, Big Tobacco paid Ailes to produce ads highlighting “real people affected by taxes.”  &gt;&gt; According to internal memos, Ailes also explored how Philip Morris could create a phony front group called the “Coalition for Fair Funding of Health Care” to deploy the same kind of “independent” ads that produced Willie Horton. In a precursor to the modern Tea Party, Ailes conspired with the tobacco companies to unleash angry phone calls on Congress – cold-calling smokers and patching them through to the switchboards on Capitol Hill – and to gin up the appearance of a grassroots uprising, busing 17,000 tobacco employees to the White House for a mass demonstration. “RJR has trained 200 people to call in to shows,” a March 1993 memo revealed. “A packet has gone to Limbaugh. We need to brief Ailes."	pizzashill	t3_6cztdv

Though his son has already decided that he will becoming after the people who came after his farther, so there is that...  But he was a dickbag in life. His death does not make him into a saint.

t3_6czqbv	t1_dhyoyo3	1495599193	Hey, 5 hours in at reddit, 11 big Zero posts, several "Unacceptable Sources" - you're on a tear!  I hope this onslaught of Russian propaganda somehow serves to educate, to marshal forces dedicated to honesty and integrity (left, right or center,) to develop excellent investigative and truthfulness validation methods and perhaps software.  I hope, but I'm rather pessimistic.  Lazy minds want to binge on Netflix, smoke big doobies (that'll get a few downvotes!) munch nachos and watch MLB or NBA or NFL or porn and somehow leave civic action on a back burner until it's past November 2018 or November 2020, and things get crappier.  The pendulum tends to swing erratically, it swings each way, sometimes it swings way far, takes out a bunch of good or at least not-too-evil people, takes down economies, governments, occasionally will knock over a whole civilization.   Christ I'm feeling old.  I thought Nixon was bad (and, uh, he was) but this is tearing across another plane of sociological structure.  If **everybody** (left, right, center, and extremes) starts feeling the need to promote their side and persuade, and feels that they can't afford the luxury of ethics, then we're fucking ourselves and don't deserve anything better than the oligarchy.  Rise up, judiciously or with reckless abandon as necessary.  The kids of the 60s (mostly folks a little older than me) did it rather well.  It took a lot of effort and some tragic sacrifice ("_four dead in O-hi-o_") but the insane never-win, never-end war was quashed, albeit not with an ideal outcome for may Vietnamese; and yes, in spite of still suffering from the malady of racism today, much **explicit** racism has been mitigated - it's painfully slow progress with disappointing relapse (Confederate Flags in California on November 9th - I mean _California_!)  OK this whole "article" will be downvoted into obscurity as it should be, might even be flagged as another "Unacceptable Source" - but I just needed to rant and vent to purge a daemon or two.  Thanks.	segvcore	t3_6czqbv

t3_6cztdv	t1_dhyp1va	1495599341	First of all, no he didn't.  He said that he was "glad Ailes lived long enough to get caught," which quite literally is *not* him expressing "pleasure at Roger Ailes' death".   I don't get rock hard at *anyone* dying, but I, too, am glad Ailes got a small sliver of the justice owed to him before he shuffled off this mortal coil.   Ailes worked very, very hard to make the world a terrible place.  He did it in his personal life, both sexually assaulting and deamaning countless women as well as enabling and shielding other sexual predators, and he did it in his professional life, where he brainwashed millions of Americans and dragged politics deep down into the mud.  He's responsible for stuffing Republicans full of garbage for nearly twenty years and drastically lowering their expectations of "journalism" and paving the way for them to elect a reality TV star and possible sufferer of dementia as POTUS.   I don't get pleasure in death.  But the world is *most certainly* worse for Ailes having existed and *definitely* better off without him.   And I, too, am glad that someone who used his power to abuse women, to shield *other* abusers like O'Reilly, finally got the public justice he was owed *before* slipping and falling in the bathroom.   Which is exactly what he said.	ninemiletree	t3_6cztdv

Benghazi, the IRS targeting conservatives, the General Services Administration -- their spending scandal -- Fast and Furious, Hillary Clinton's private email server -- we know felonies were committed there -- the Clinton Foundation, the giveaway of one-fifth of our uranium production to Russia, Bowe Bergdahl, the Iranian prisoner swap, the VA scandal, Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton meeting on the tarmac, surveillance of journalists like James Rosen and The Associated Press, Solyndra, the Secret Service prostitution scandal, unaccompanied minors entering the U.S., Hurricane Sandy funds and Healthcare.gov contracts.  Sean remembers all that stuff off the top of his head. He's really smart. I've heard him memorize numbers about the obama economy, record number of ppl on food stamps and unemployed etc. I don't know how he does it. He's very passionate about this country and the things that desperately need to be fixed. I think he admires trump bc they have the same vision of a strong prosperous America.	rush42	t1_dhyoaxb

If you're a liberal, there's a very clear choice of which party to vote for, and if you're a conservative, there's a very clear choice of which party you'll be ideologically inclined to vote for.    You're saying both parties are the same, and they are not. They are both political parties in a two party system, and they both have their moneyed interests, yes, but they push and promote different interests.   Are you implying that liberals re voting for conservative or centre-right candidates because the democrats aren't *left* enough for them?  If they aren't, they don't deserve to have liberal elected officials if they don't understand a principle that Fabian Socialists understood in the 1880's on how governance works.	artyfoul	t1_dhys3km

Obama saving the auto industry didn't get as much coverage or importance past the $$ that was being spent bailing them out. Nevermind that whole states would have been utterly screwed had the automakers folded.   That Carrier deal backfired. I keep seeing headlines talking about him "bringing jobs back to America" and making companies commit to his vision. I think those "deals" will backfire worse.

Just because you're innocent, doesn't mean you get to try to influence the investigation.   Obviously if it turns out there is direct evidence of collusion, it's even bigger.

This was probably in an attempt by someone to see whether or not Seth Rich had a mega account.

Today he announced that he will no longer be publicly speaking about the Seth Rich conspiracy, but will continue to investigate it privately.   &gt;This flies in the face of the requests of Mr. Rich's family and is quite frankly offensive. Hannity and his ilk have pushed this conspiracy theory against the explicit wishes of Mr. Rich's family for weeks. Such behavior should not be rewarded with ad funding.   &gt;As a customer who frequently and passionately promotes Casper products, I just wanted to let you know that I don't believe Hannity's show represents your brand well, and your support directly feeds the trauma of a family who has already been so terribly victimized. No family should have to beg a national "news" network to stop peddling conspiracies about their son's murder.   &gt;I hope you will reconsider your ad space purchases during his show.	pm-me-neckbeards	t1_dhzdfip

t3_6d2s7u	t1_dhzeo44	1495642174	Well 4chan has been all over Seth Rich's shit for the past week, they even posted screenshots showing someone (presumably Rich's dad) was in Rich's Gmail account a few days ago.

Lately, using it the way you did (e.g., in place of "biased news" or "clickbait news", or "the article's conclusion isn't fully supported by their stance") is a good sign that the person is trolling, a paid russian shill, or just really stupid. No one wants to be mistaken for those things, so it would be best if you aim to only use "fake news" to means "wholly fabricated news".	Robo_Joe	t1_dhzeo44

t3_6d2s7u	t1_dhziil2	1495645910	LOL. This is even worse, what you linked doesn't even make any sense. Only people with zero IT knowledge would buy what you just linked.  &gt;Dotcom, it seemed, may have been willing to create a fake archive of emails from Rich to “prove” his role in the DNC hack.   * This directly conflicts with the previous assertion that Dotcom was trying to get into Seth Rich's Gmail account via some type of phishing attack, ie "hack into"   * He doesn't need the email to click on anything to "prove" some fake emails.   Could dotcom create some fake emails? Yes - but they won't be verifiable by DKIM. DKIM ensures that the timestamp, the contents, everything has been untouched. Without DKIM/full headers the emails are useless. Clicking on a link does not help him in this regard at all. So that theory is utterly ridiculous.  &gt;“It looks like someone set up a fake Gmail account, then used that Gmail account to create the Mega account. This part is pretty standard."   * Setup a fake gmail account? That doesn't even make sense - if you create fake gmail account, you get the emails to that account. Unless he means someone typed in Seth Rich's email account which is **ding ding ding** exactly what I've been saying.  &gt;Mega then checks with Gmail to see if the account exists, which is Mega’s somewhat cheesy way of authenticating identity. You then get to set up the Mega account.  So... dumb way of saying it sent a welcome email?  &gt; It’s a system designed to enable pseudonyms and fake identities.  What does this even mean? Welcome emails/verifications = enabling pseudonyms and fake identies.   This guy "James Lewis, cybersecurity expert" is a grade A clown. How people like this can call themselves a cybersecurity expert is hilarious. Jump on over to /r/asknetsec and see what they think of these two paragraphs of drivel.

t3_6d39tt	t1_dhzipkc	1495646110	This is an argument that so far hasn't gained much traction where it needs to, in the GOP and the Trump base. I think because it's a legalistic-sounding term and seems like liberal nit-picking.   Someone needs to dumb it down to a fifth-grade level and explain that the president is in a position to use the powers of his office to make himself rich. Even then, I wonder how many people will care, simply assuming that's what all politicians do anyway.	PaulsRedditUsername	t3_6d39tt
t3_6d1t1t	t1_dhzipye	1495646121	The interactions between Gowdy and Brennan were the best parts.  Gowdy was grandstanding and trying to sow doubt, he failed on both accounts.  *Paraphrasing* Gowdy: I want you to name names.  Brennan: I'm not going to do that, and also you already have the list of names (you dolt).  Watching it, I kept thinking about the jury swap scene in [The Untouchables](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094226/?ref_=nv_sr_1) when Eliot Ness informed the judge that his name was in the Capone's ledger as having accepted bribes.  I **so** wanted Brennan to say "Your name is on that list".  That was the kind of theatre, though not the specific result, Gowdy was trying to create.  It was nice to see his attempts fail, but I'd rather see him go down too.	m_mf_w	t1_dhzi7la

t3_6d3ijg	t1_dhzjwfv	1495647343	&gt;“We need to get back in touch with Middle America and realize the role the economy plays in these elections and that our economic plan just hasn’t been resonating with many Americans,” said Moulton.  Hard to argue with that when polling shows that the American people identify the GOP more with "the little guy."  Even Trump got elected promising to bring back jobs, give health care to everyone, and spend more money at home on infrastructure.  It was a con, but it's still what the people want.  Refocusing on a progressive economic message is just good strategy.  The Dem coalition is diverse and often disagrees, but the economy affects *everyone* in the entire country.  &gt;“But if Democrats don’t have an alternative plan, if our only alternative is just to say, ‘Well we’re not quite as bad as the Republicans,’ then I don’t think a lot of people will vote for us.”    Another good argument.  Clinton ran heavily against Trump (something like 93% of her ad campaign), and it didn't work.  As heinous as Trump is, Dems need to say what they are *for*.  And not only that, what they will do for the American people.  All of them.	FreezieKO	t3_6d3ijg

It's US government, and specifically the US Congress, giving up fundamental individual rights in the name of some nebulous national security benefit.  It could potentially be unconstitutional. It has never been tested in courts. The big problem is finding someone with actual legal standing to sue the government, and then carry the case all the way to the Supreme Court somehow. Organizations like ACLU have been trying, but the handful of attempts so far have fizzled out in lower courts because the judicial branch gives great deference to the executive on classified matters of national security. Ultimately it is unlikely for the issue to be resolved in SCOTUS. We will have to resolve it legislatively, by electing representatives who will actually take a stand and vote to sunset the Patriot Act for good.	bleed_air_blimp	t3_6d65pq

Didn't hear the Republican congress contesting it either.  In fact, as I recall, any challenge to the provision that allows it is still met with opposition by the GOP.

t3_6d7i7y	t1_di0hsze	1495688017	This makes me think nobody got this on video. The police interviewed multiple people and likely would have asked if video existed.   If they believed there could be video, I believe they would wait to make to the charge.  Worst case scenario for Gianforte and now the sheriff is if video does come out and it's as bad as the audio and witness descriptions.   There was a time I would say this is a certain withdrawal by Gianforte.. but the last ~12 months have taught me to always expect the unexpected... so he'll probably be hired by Trump later this week.	momne	t3_6d7i7y

t3_6d8031	t1_di0nr9u	1495701995	Okay let's talk about that visit to the holocaust memorial. I've been to Yad Vashem recently myself. It's a huge place and very detailed...each room has videos of survivors telling their stories. He had only one hour there! During that time he said this:   &gt;“Millions of wonderful and beautiful lives, men, women and children were extinguished as part of a systematic attempt to eliminate the Jewish people,” Trump said on Tuesday. “It is our solemn duty to remember, to mourn, to grieve and to honor every single life that was so cruelly and viciously taken.”  Apparently Bibi was touched by what he said. As for what trump wrote in the book, he did not have time to write a lot. But he did say it was great to be there with his friends, and that they would "never forget" (which is the main theme of the museum). Yes, perhaps his comment was too upbeat. He might have considered that in advance. (I personally hate signing guestbooks) I think it was more a matter of being short on time and just overwhelmed by the whole trip. Israel has a lot to take in.   As for the rest....yes the pope did not look happy to meet trump initially, but after they spoke, the pope seemed much happier. Trump said he would always remember their discussion and would work for peace.   And hey, I'm only 54 and I would be exhausted keeping that pace after jet lag and everything else.   As for melania....yes we all discuss this in the US as well. Especially as women lol. My daughter pointed out that melania wears high heels and Donald just walks too fast. He tries to take her hand and pull her forward just a bit, and she can't keep that pace. It may be something that simple! She always looks very poised and refined and I'm sure she doesn't want to trip and fall! Could be that....could be she's stressed out from traveling in the public eye....apparently she was hoping he wouldn't win, as she avoids the spotlight, but who knows. When she did speak, she was very gracious!  Thanks for your insights....but do you think there might be *anyone* in Norway who sees him in a positive light? Lol.	rush42	t1_di0n955
t3_6d8cb9	t1_di0nw87	1495702402	&gt;Attorney General Jeff Sessions did not disclose meetings he had last year with Russian officials when he applied for his security clearance, the Justice Department told CNN Wednesday.  The more important part of the article:  &gt;Sessions initially listed a year's worth of meetings with foreign officials on the security clearance form, according to Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores. But she says he and his staff were then told by an FBI employee who assisted in filling out the form, known as the SF-86, that he didn't need to list dozens of meetings with foreign ambassadors that happened in his capacity as a senator.	mutatedpancake	t3_6d8cb9

t3_6d8031	t1_di18r2c	1495733725	Hey thanks for that well referenced response. Obviously you know something about religion. I'm impressed!  But I disagree with your comments about Rubio and pence. Pence is too homophobic is his problem. Rubio is actually much more moderate especially with immigration, which was a problem with a lot of the republican base. He does have a lot of good ideas and is unapologetic for his faith, which I respect.   With all due respect, I think compassionate conservatives really do want to help the poor, they just go about it in a different way. Like creating jobs, strengthening the economy, strengthening families, etc. I think fixing Obamacare to reduce the rates through competition is an attempt to help the working class. And they have some rationale for leaving Medicaid up to each state but I'm not sure what it is.   Overall I get what you're saying that poor ppl will die unless we do something. But is that the same as actually physically, intentionally, and brutally killing a late term preborn infant who can feel ?  It's the difference between taking a knife and stabbing a child vs having him be poor and underprivileged, ( which in this country is still way better than in a third world country). I'm not saying poverty is ok. It is something we need to address of course. But I would think the priority would be to get people to stop actively stabbing and killing their kids. And then address the conditions in which they live.	rush42	t1_di160to

t3_6d8031	t1_di19cje	1495734366	&gt; Rubio is actually much more moderate especially with immigration,  Rubio and Scott Walker had an extremism-off during the first republican debate where they competed to make abortion extra illegal, with no exceptions for rape or the life of the mother.  Again, this would leave women to die for ectopic pregnances etc.  Rubio *has* agreed that he'll take absolutely any ban he can get but he's gunning for dead women in the end.    https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/12/scott-walker-marco-rubio-abortion-republican-party  &gt;Overall I get what you're saying that poor ppl will die unless we do something. But is that the same as actually physically, intentionally, and brutally killing a late term preborn infant who can feel ?  Yes.  People are going to die.  It's the intention.    Enacting greed-based legislation and standing by smirking while the lowest of us suffer is every bit as abhorrent as the worst Kermit Gosnell abortion.    The AHCA, supported by Trump AND Pence, will kick 23 million people off healthcare.  It treats zika as a pre-existing condition.  It will make professionally attended labor too expensive for all but the rich.  Pence ran with a man who promised to target the families of people who may not even be terrorists.  He hasn't spoken out about the hundreds of civilian murders committed by Trump's military.    Why is life only valuable to you guys until labor kicks in?  This makes no sense.

Oh come on. Nobody is "gunning for dead women."  That just makes no sense.   Secondly, I must correct the misconception that removing an ectopic pregnancy equals an elective abortion. It's not the same thing. An ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency that must be removed before it ruptures.,.this is standard medical procedure and HAS to be done.  It's not an abortion. A fetus cannot grow inside a Fallopian tube. Same with removing a stillborn baby that has died in the womb. This is not an abortion either. The dead fetus has to be removed of the mother gets septic and dies. It would be medical malpractice not to do so. This is not an abortion bc the fetus is already dead.   There are so many misconceptions surrounding abortion and people really need to be educated before they take a stand on these issues. Another example is the health of the mother. The definitive treatment, if all other measures fail, is to deliver the baby. If she is far enough along that the baby could survive, then he or she can be delivered alive. Abortion in this case is not necessary. Even if they killed the baby, they would still have to get it out, either by labor/delivery or c section. This is not a reason for late term abortion.     People who oppose an exception for rape are basically arguing that the child does not deserve to die for the sins of the father. I personally think we should really encourage women to go to the hospital right away after the rape to prevent pregnancy from occurring. But I am also not against first trimester abortion. Certainly a woman can make a decision before her baby is developed enough to be aware of what's happening.   My point is that these views are not at all radical. RADICAL would be Hilary's extremist pro abortion views....i can post the links again if you like.	rush42	t1_di19cje

If they think it's okay to stand by while children die from treatable childhood illnesses, or starve, why wouldn't they stand by while women die for the "will of God"?  You aren't critically examining your own "side".  You are supporting a horrible man.  Do you think what he did to Spicer was okay?  This is a terrible person you are defending.    If Obama went on an "apology tour", so what?  Isn't being humble a good quality?  In a more patriotic vein, isn't that a pretty accurate interpretation of "Speak softly and carry a big stick"?  Your "side" rejects all of Christianity and then kind of makes up its own rules.  It's a bastardized Judaism with a cherry-picked side of Paul.  You can't justify anything they're doing using the Gospels.

Yes, we did have 30 years of a decline in crime, which we did with tough sentencing, and tough prosecution.”  &gt; During his remarks, Sessions made no secret of his disdain for the reforms sought by his predecessors. The DOJ would “do work that furthers law enforcement, not undermines law enforcement,” he said.  &gt; Sessions also doubled down on his belief that drug use and violent crime are tightly correlated. “Drugs and crime go together,” Sessions said. “If they don’t fear you, they don’t pay you.” But reform advocates argue that increased criminalization of drugs breeds competition between distribution networks and perpetuates violence.

Then-President Obama warned against allowing this, and now the families in Iraq have a footing to sue the United States for its role in the deaths of loved ones.

We associate lynchings with the violent groupthink created by a mob, but in 2017 physical mobs are not required to create that atmosphere. Sean Urbanski was part of a Facebook group called “Alt Reich: Nation,” which has since been taken down. Based on screengrabs still available online, this community performed the function of a mob: agitating its participants not only to racist bigotry but also to violence.	westkms	t1_di1jr0s
t3_6dcctn	t1_di1k8iu	1495746377	This is a reminder that the most rabid portion of Trump's base isn't entirely made up of older folks:  &gt; Urbanski, as has been widely reported, is a member of a racist Facebook group called “Alt-Reich: Nation.” But that’s also not all he is. He’s a college student who grew up in the leafy suburban environs of Severna Park, Maryland. He hung out at Adele H. Stamp Student Union, studied at McKeldin Library, and wore his Baltimore Ravens gear around campus. He was not an interloper or an outsider. He is a homegrown terrorist who grew out of the soil of this college campus.  &gt; The sooner that the administration and the student body reckon with that reality, the better. The UMD campus has seen racist chalkings, nooses, flyers, and threats since Donald Trump took office. And yes, one would have to be willingly obtuse to not see a direct line from having open white supremacists in the Oval Office to the emboldening of the perpetrators—not just at UMD but, according to NPR reporting, at campuses across the country.	neuronexmachina	t3_6dcctn

t3_6dcgof	t1_di1kon6	1495746902	This is my understanding of it.   Liberals like biased news, but they don't like rank dishonesty. Plus they are open to unbiased news sources too.   Conservatives only want biased news, and are comfortable with dishonest news.   That is the big difference. Liberals watch biased news like msnbc or daily kos, but don't want to be lied to and will watch unbiased news sources like ABC or CBS as well as liberal sources.   Conservatives only want biased news like Fox or talk radio, think everything that isn't biased for them is untrustworthy and are comfortable being lied to.   Basically liberals want the facts both with or without a liberal slant. Conservatives want affirmation of their existing belief structure irrelevant of whether it is true or not and will denounce all news sources that threatened their belief structure as fake, untrustworthy or biased.   But both sides like biased news.	Five_Decades	t1_di1kf06

Just ask the Romans how well brute force worked in wiping out the Christians.  If we're going to win this "war" we're going to have to do things that will make life better for everyone everywhere.  We need to make it clear that we're *only* fighting those who want to harm others. Muslims and Islam are not our enemies.  We need to fight their propaganda with our own.  And yeah, it sucks, it would take a long time and we won't see immediate results.

t3_6dc73r	t1_di1kvn5	1495747130	So that is in fact your solution? Take no action and hope that they just stop attacking random civilians? Also, the US does not think it has "the right to bomb whatever they want" that distinction quite clearly goes to the people setting bombs off in stadiums, flying planes into buildings, and driving trucks into crowded sidewalks.   It would be great if we could affect peace through diplomacy instead of war. But to be open diplomatic relations, both sides need to be willing to come to the table. IS has no interest in negotiations. They want complete control and domination over the middle east and are willing to accept to no less. And there are a lot of people that object to that, including a whole shit load of people in the middle east.	Gangreless	t1_di1k5yp
t3_6dc73r	t1_di1kvru	1495747134	And your response absolutely ignores the facts.  Without the strike, we would have killed 0 people, including 0 civilians.  Yes, using human shields is barbaric.  Almost as barbaric as killing 105 of those human shields to kill two bad guys.  In fact, that's why bad guys use human shields, because good guys aren't supposed to just kill them, it would make them the bad guy.  They are the aggressors in Mosul, which if I remember my geography isn't in the US.  But sure yea, our actions aren't our fault, those other guys made us drop bombs.  Remind me again where ISIS came from?  Oh that's right, from other fuckups by other republicans. But obviously nothing is the fault of the party of personal responsibility, not even their own choices and actions.  The only non-barbaric, non-sociopathic, non-stupid and non-murderous course of action when faced with human shields is to not kill the human shields.  So we killed 105 innocent people to kill two bad guys.  Ever stop to think if any of those 105 people have friends or relatives?  Ever stop to think that the murder of their innocent friend or family member might cause more than 2 of those people to side with the guys who didn't kill their friends and family?  So in the grand scheme we killed two bad guys, killed 105 innocents and created who knows how many more bad guys.	ifyoupaiditisntfree	t1_di1j0on

t3_6d8031	t1_di1lk6q	1495747943	Yes you have shown me a couple of examples where late term abortion was Indicated but these are a few cases out of the 13000 total late term abortions. And as I said, these can be handled on a case by case basis by court order.   In this country children don't typically die of starvation bc there are social programs and charities to prevent that. In some other countries you see children begging in the streets. I don't think it would ever come to that in the US. Also kids really aren't going to die of preventable/treatable diseases in the US. Vaccines are still required for school. And there are free clinics treating kids for serious stuff. Even if the federal government leaves Medicaid to the states, they will not cut health programs to children, or prenatal care. It's just too big a public health risk.  Also I don't know anyone in the US who says anything about women dying for the "will of God". As i said before, even the strictest abortion restrictions allow exceptions for the life of the mother, but it's usually not an issue bc they can just deliver the baby alive. Despite how liberals try to paint it, this really is a civilized nation and we do not want ppl to die, which is actually one of the reasons conservatives resist socialized medicine with its limits, cutoffs and death panels. Of course to be a "civilized nation", we have to stop killing sentient viable late term preborn infants. Even saint mother Theresa said so.   Yes what he did to Spicey really sucked. No two ways about it. Idk wats going on there. But I would not be half surprised if Spicey gets even somehow....leaking something about Russia perhaps?  No, Obama did not carry a big stick. He drew red lines in the sand which were blatantly ignored, and did nothing. He helped create ISIS by leaving a power vacuum in Iraq. He did not support our ally, Israel, at the UN. Overall I think trump is a more imposing figure. But that doesn't mean i like him.   And lastly yes, a lot of my fellow Catholics are actually fiscally liberals for the reasons you state. I also know a lot of religious Christians, my extended family Included, who are staunch conservatives and it is actually appalling to my kids (who were raised catholic but now aren't), who are liberals for the same reasons you discuss. They are always on my case about true Christianity just as you are.   Edit   2 Thessalonians 3:10  "For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat."  So you were right about Paul.....	rush42	t1_di1bx37
t3_6dc73r	t1_di1lm9s	1495748011	In a way, we are fighting a nation. At the very least, it's an entity whose ultimate goal is to become a nation. IS wants a new Islamic caliphate across the middle east. Their version of Islam is definitely a part of the problem.   My personal opinion is a bit more isolationist. I think we should stay out of other countries' business unless they interfere with ours. But we have allies and treaties and agreements which cause us to entangle ourselves in the affairs of other nations. We also have the largest and most powerful military in the world, sometimes that means acting as world police for nations who can't otherwise defend themselves.   It's definitely a difficult situation. On the one hand, we certainly can't just "turn the other cheek" when we are attacked. In terms of world politics, we can't be seen to be weak. In the other hand, retaliation often leads its own retaliation Which is why nations have nuclear weapons-to stop the back and forth attacks because of mutually assured destruction.   The only way for us to "win" is for the people of the middle east, particularly the areas the IS wants control of the most, to stand up for themselves, against IS.	Gangreless	t1_di1ksn0
t3_6dc73r	t1_di1lu7b	1495748276	Yes, and that guy killed 22 people.  We just killed almost 5x that many.  What's the solution to terrorism? I do know what isn't the solution.  What isn't the solution is being terrified and throwing everything you stand for out the window because you have minuscule chance of being a victim of terror.  And then blowing up hundreds of innocent civilians and creating more terrorist.  Terrorist win by causing terror and changes in their targets lives or beliefs.  You destroy terrorism by eliminating the root of the terrorist recruiting tools.  Education, reducing poverty, economic oppurtunities.  Everytime we react to attacks based on fear, they win.  That is literally their goal.  They get these kids to strap on bombs by painting us as the bad guy.  Well it saves them time when we paint ourselves that way.	ifyoupaiditisntfree	t1_di1jr00

Would there not have been a better course of action then to just shoot anyway? Seems to me like the death of 100 was not worth the death of two snipers. Why shouldn't the US be held, at least somewhat, responsible for it? We are at the apex of technological advancements, especially when it comes to military tech, so I'm sure there were other options. Or maybe just common sense to weigh wether or not it was worth all of those civilian casualties.	sfgiantsfan650	t1_di1lgva

That's what we're fighting to prevent. Because nobody thinks that this group with these beliefs should have control over the middle east. It's easy to dismiss them by calling them terrorists, it's scary and makes it easy to remember what they're the enemy. And I'm sure that most of the lower level members (like the guys on the ground blowing themselves up), are doing it because of a certain ideology that has been drilled into them by the guys in charge with promises of whatever in the afterlife. But make no mistake - IS is, at its core, a politically motivated entity taking advantage of a religion rife with fundamentalists.   It shouldn't be so easy to recruit suicide bombers and people willing to mass murder civilians, but for some reason, Islam provides an easy forum for it.	Gangreless	t1_di1lu7b

t3_6dc73r	t1_di1n394	1495749789	&gt; If you know that IS uses civilians as shields, quit fucking bombing them because you're bombing civilians.  But you don't know that! This isn't like when we drone strike a caravan of terrorists outside a combat zone, in which case we are totally culpable for any civilian deaths.  This was in combat, where lots of elements are unknowable. IS rousted people out of their homes and told them to take cover closer to the fighting. They had their own soldiers use that same structure as cover. Unless you're claiming a conspiracy, nobody knew this except the Isis fighters themselves.  To let those snipers continue to kill soldiers for days or weeks until we reach certainty that there's no civilians in the building is simply not a viable option. It's not as if you can get ground forces or (or UN inspectors, or whoever) close to the building to take a look; that's the entire reason they called for a strike in the first place.

t3_6dcqpe	t1_di1nb21	1495750059	All justices have to support their conclusions with a clear line of legal reasoning.  Although there personal social philosophies might influence their preferred conclusion, that conclusion still has to be supported by an unbroken chain of strict legal logic.  Even socially conservative justices would find it extremely difficult to agree with DOJ that (1) the President is above any review whatsoever anytime he invokes national security as a reason for an Executive Order, and (2) courts cannot consider any evidence outside the Executive Order itself.  For Supreme Court justices, this is not simply a matter of whether they are personally for or against a Muslim ban.  Trump is arguing for a massive increase in Executive Branch power at the direct expense of the Judicial Branch.	voompanatos	t1_di1mh3k
t3_6dcqpe	t1_di1nczc	1495750123	Ah, that's right. For a moment, I've substituted DoJ and AG for Rod Rosenstein and I was appalled that he would do something like this.

t3_6dcqpe	t1_di1nd5n	1495750129	If the Supremes do grant review the only issues I could think of would be:  (1) the propriety of using Trump and company's statements about the intent of the ban as evidence . . . which considering the precedent for that kind of evidence in Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process cases to glean discriminatory intent for a law that is not discriminatory on its face; or   (2) If they REALLY just feel like dealing with issues over executive authority.   But yeah, it seems so unlikely since both Circuits agreed. They would *really* want to get at these issues to grant cert here.	Keener1899	t1_di1mnu6

It's no mistake about the quality difference between, say, Toyota and a Ford. But we get this idea from quite a while ago, when there was a major shift in the the operations of assembly plants. America was very slow to catch on. But we're basically well past that, and live with the cultural inertia.  Personally, looking at the numbers, its clear that the imports found a market ahead of the domestic variation. At the same time, its clear that domestic trucks have no true rival in imports. Perhaps its just perspective and requirements? Or maybe just apples and oranges? I dunno. We sell more trucks than cars, but view quality from the car perspective instead.	blueryth	t1_di1npy5

t3_6dcwip	t1_di1slu6	1495756969	US trucks are the most popular because the Europeans *don't make* such vehicles. Trucks in Europe are much smaller and less powerful, due to the phenomenal price of gas over there.  The Japanese have made some headway at making US-style trucks for the US market - Toyota, Nissan etc make trucks for other parts of the world that are small and economical, while the trucks they make for the US are much bigger, more like an F150. But they still aren't quite as big and powerful as American trucks, so they still lag behind American trucks in US sales.  I'm pretty sure, if BMW, Mercedes and co decided to compete with the upper-tier of American trucks, they'd take a pretty big chunk out of the market. Just like they did with SUVs, where the situation used to be similar - the Europeans didn't really make any SUVs until recently.	Taniwha_NZ	t1_di1pir2
t3_6dcwip	t1_di1srvo	1495757200	I mean, it's almost as if he thinks BMW is sending cheap-ass cars over to the US and undercutting the expensive US cars, thanks to Europe's slave-wages and complete lack of unions and safety regulations.  In reality, it's exactly the opposite - Europe pays higher wages and has more expensive regulatory environments for car manufacturing, so if they can land cars in the US and still sell them, the problem is fairly obviously that US cars are garbage and people just don't want them.  Of course, most European cars sold in the US are actually manufactures in the US, so the whole arguement is demented and further shows Trump has less than a grade-schooler's understanding of the situation.

In 2005, following an investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, U.S. Attorney Chris Christie negotiated a plea agreement with Kushner, under which he pleaded guilty to 18 counts of illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering. The witness-tampering charge arose from Kushner's act of retaliation against William Schulder, his sister Esther's husband, who was cooperating with federal investigators; Kushner hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, arranged to record an encounter between the two, and had the tape sent to his sister. Kushner was sentenced to two years in prison and served 14 months at Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery in Alabama before being sent to a halfway house in Newark, New Jersey to complete his sentence.[18][19][20] He was released from prison on August 25, 2006.

Sure, Richard Spencer is an insidious asshole whom most people can imagine punching with satisfaction.  And white nationalism is harmful all the time, not just when its leaders are on the clock.  it's true.  It doesn't seem to me that this is something that makes the public harassment of individuals for their political views somehow, despite all history, no longer harmful.

t3_6detzi	t1_di250gr	1495774064	Yes he is. The "commitment" is a non written agreement to aim for 2% of GDP in defense budget until 2024. (Last time I checked it was 2017)   It's not even binding. No one owes money to NATO or US. If America loves to spend 10 times more than anyone else, it's their problem. Most of their wars aren't even NATO wars.	Rupperrt	t1_di24w5v
t3_6detzi	t1_di2544z	1495774250	Well, they have a tiny GDP compared to France and Germany and a big marine.

t3_6detzi	t1_di25b5s	1495774607	There were sort of. Trump thinks, NATO has a budget everyone pays in or something.  NATO has agreed on that countries should aim for 2% of GDP defense spending until 2024. It's neither binding nor is anyone owing anyone anything.  To raise defense spending is harder than just throwing money at it. Especially with a huge GDP, a small land and no expensive nuclear arsenal like Germany.	Rupperrt	t1_di24ya9

It's the reason we haven't had one since 1787.	GregoryPanic	t1_di1trdj
t3_6detzi	t1_di25i4d	1495774963	Because Trump thinks countries owe NATO or the US money.  The loose agreement to aim for 2% of GDP in defense spending until 2024 is neither binding nor ideal.  Greece has a huge sea marine, border to Turkey and a tiny GDP. A couple of boats and you'll have 2%.  Germany has a huge GDP, can't have nuclear weapons, is very densely populated and has nearly full employment.  Rising the budget is more than just throwing money at defense. It's an infrastructural challenge. That's why they put the date 2024 in.	Rupperrt	t1_di259id

It's not just that Trump is an embarrassment of a human being; lacking in intelligence, critical thinking skills, controlled temperament and many other abysmal qualities making him unfit.  It's that it says to the world this moron was elected.  There are enough people of a particular quality in America that this comedy of errors was not just possible, but realized.   This gets compounded with the fact that he was the chosen one to receive Putin's stream of golden selection piss.  So America is now being led by a buffoon that everyone knows was Putin's preference to make the country at its weakest in response to his nefarious aims.  The cherry on top of this shit sundae being that apparently elected representatives of his own party don't give a flying fuck about that, nor do the members of the electorate that voted for him.  If some cog of balance does not slip into the gear-works, resulting in his removal from office, I'd go 50/50 odds that in either 3.7 or 7.7 years there will not be an election.  He'll have entrenched himself sufficiently to the goal of a coup and will move forward with one.  The US is on track to becoming a failed state if the Trump presidency is not brought to an end.  No doubt every developed nation is looking at contingencies and potential strategies in some of the annals of their back rooms in preparation for this possibility.	idgitsinamerica	t1_di24q9g

t3_6detzi	t1_di25ukd	1495775603	&gt;Other leaders, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, also appeared to be containing laughter during Trump's speech, Neil Cavuto said on "Your World" this afternoon. Cavuto said these leaders who were "snickering" and "laughing" at Trump and "treating him like a pariah" in the group photo will now have to explain their actions to the president of the United States. "It is more than President Trump, it is about the country he represents and the leadership we have as head of this organization," Cavuto said.  They don't have to explain shit, fuckface.

t3_6detzi	t1_di25vo2	1495775662	That's adorable, you think the "defensive alliance" is why NATO exists.  Do you think those little countries at 2% would be even slightly relevant in a world war?  No, that's not the point of NATO, if that were the point of NATO, it would have never even existed.  NATO is used to base US troops globally, spread US influence, and contain our enemies. Location is more important than military power for nearly every member of NATO.  So yeah, in terms of soft power, the US gains more than anyone else from NATO.	pizzashill	t1_di25ry2
t3_6detzi	t1_di25vs9	1495775668	Look into civil spending for nato.  The US provides 20-25% of the budget year in and year out.

t3_6detzi	t1_di26794	1495776286	No, there's not, because every President until Trump has realized its worth paying voluntarily more than other countries because NATO is an incredible tool for advancing American ideology and interests abroad.

t3_6detzi	t1_di26836	1495776332	Yeah, you can go read that if you want, or you can be educated on the subject and think about it.  I am telling you right now that location is the only relevant factor for NATO, all of those little countries with 2% defense spending are worthless in a war, they'd get rolled over in a day.  Why do you think Russia is so rabidly against NATO if it's just a defensive alliance?  It isn't, location is why, they're contained. Go ask any military leader about NATO, go read about this - there's a reason they don't care about 2%.	pizzashill	t1_di265vk

t3_6detzi	t1_di26gh2	1495776806	There's also the whole thing with trade pacts and visa exemptions that often follow in hand with membership in NATO. Membership in NATO has become a powerful and marked symbol that a country is joining "the West", as nebulous a concept as that is vis a vis joining Putin's desire for a resurgant Russia that dominates Eastern Europe and Asia.   Countries generally prefer to be part of the West because we are far more prosperous and powerful than Russia.	dolphins3	t1_di26836
t3_6detzi	t1_di26hs2	1495776879	Firstly, that wasn't the time or place for that discussion. At all. It was rude and childish.   Secondly, that commitment to NATO, all for one and one for all, was the expected verbiage of solidarity. That commitment has only needed honoring ONCE since NATO was formed after WWII. Guess what country was in dire need of that support? The United States of America after 9/11.  Every President since JFK has reminded NATO about paying their share. And in principle it's proper to demand that happen. But to pervert that ceremony in that manner. To publicly shame those leaders damages the relationships of member countries.   This risks destroying NATO and destabilizing the western world. You know, the people responsible for the SAFEST TIME PERIOD IN KNOWN HUMAN HISTORY!?   Despite what cable propaganda says, you're safer today than ever. Trump us doing his damnedest to destroy that. And you're worried about silly shit that can be resolved behind closed doors.

t3_6dg6oo	t1_di2dxl2	1495796976	From the article:  • The ban was put in place due to the lemons being a vector for disease • Obama was slated to lift the ban after establishing better relations with Argentina's president and after scientists confirmed that the quality control issues were solved. • A stay was put in place to halt lifting the ban by Trump's administration on Jan 23rd. • Argentinian President Macri visits Trump in April. • Stay is reversed by administration.  This isn't one of those times where Trump is just wantonly "deregulating" the industry. But it does suck for US citrus farmers since Argentina is apparently the leading lemon grower on the planet. I just question that the politics are actually overriding the science, as is claimed by the US citrus farmers quoted in the article.   Rather, I think Trump's initial stay of lifting the ban was simply political posturing because it was just another way to say "fuck you, Obama" without deferring at all to the science behind the original ban or even to preserving citrus farming in the US.  Edit: added Macri visit, some other words.	256bit	t3_6dg6oo

But I can say that I do not trust this decision being made by a man who is honestly the stupidest human being I've ever heard of. I would feel more confident determining the outcome on a coin flip than leaving it up to Trump, and this isn't saying much.   If someone were to grill him on why he made this decision, I guarantee you he couldn't explain it without an over abundance of adjectives, and virtually zero substance.

t3_6dg6oo	t1_di2fu5g	1495800939	The primary problems with food from abroad is disease -- and not just people disease, but plant disease. Say you get lemons from Argentina, and they have some mites on them here and there. Now, the lemons from Argentina have, for decades, been cultivated with those mites in mind, treated to get rid of those mites, and strategically grown to have a resistance to the mites; the mites don't really like them anymore, but you'll still get some around there anyway, so they treat that too.  So then it ends up in the US. If those mites start getting on OUR lemons, then our entire lemon crop could die out. Simple as that. Because they have not been cultivated to ward off those PARTICULAR mites, only the ones that show up here.  Further, there are some diseases  that aren't spread by mites in many plants, and planting plants that are susceptible and inflicted to that  disease puts the rest of the crop in danger, too.  Now, I'm not too hard into Agriculture, but that's one of the things we deal with when it comes to the food trade, vegetables and fruits, mainly. It's why inspections are so harsh when moving fruits and vegetables over even state lines.	ChaoticGoodEconomics	t1_di2ebu6

t3_6dhal3	t1_di2mt09	1495810593	I had to get a car out of an impound lot after an accident. It was $30 a day plus the cost of a tow and could only be paid in cash. Also they were only open for picking up your vehicle between 10am and 1130am and 1pm to 330pm.   After giving them the money and asking why it was cash only and not credit cards or other form of traceable source, the receptionist said, it is their business their rules.   I told her that most places that only accept cash are laundering money and doing something illegal. Since cash can’t be tracked and they can modify records to create money out of thin air. She gave me this look of I want to murder you.  Well six months later I called and asked for a copy of the towing and storage receipt. I still had the original. I was not surprised when it was adjusted from 4 days to 12 days. Creating almost $240 of money out of thin air. Forwarded it to the Local news station and county officials.   Point is there are way more other sources and ways to hid illegal money.	PazDak	t1_di2lyuw

You just have to show up in the morning and hope they open, there's usually a crowd of 50 people or so that wait for hours.

That's why "her" comment karma is at -100. It's disgusting that someone would deliberately give out FALSE MEDICAL INFORMATION while pretending to be a doctor for political reasons. It terrifies me that some people on reddit will assume what "she" is saying is fact, especially teenage girls. This person is disgusting and should be thrown off reddit, but I'll settle for showing up every time "she" mentions abortions or her fake medical career and letting people know what's up. If you see her giving out fake medical information on reddit in the future, please alert the person she's speaking to because they might not know better and assume she's giving out true information.	dt74776	t1_di19cje

t3_6ddka0	t1_di37uj1	1495835177	Many constitutions are significantly easier to amend than the US constitution, are significantly newer, and/or were longer and more detailed on initial drafting. [This list is interesting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_constitutions). It often seems simpler in parliamentary systems.  You have 9 countries on this list with constitutions predating the 20th century, and Argentina's at least has been significantly reformed 6 times.  I haven't done an exhaustive comparison, but the United States has an old, short, vague constitution with a cumbersome amendment process. Because it was implemented so relatively early and has never been comprehensively reformed, we don't have the benefit of taking parts that work from other systems.	Seventeen34	t1_di2emuq

These labels have lost all meaning. For one, they have been used out of context for so long - mostly to smear people with derogatory labels (or labels that are derogatory to certain people) - that they mean nothing.  It's like Sean Hannity and his use of 'Liberal'. Based on his context of that term, it's obvious that he either has no idea what it means, or uses it as a label because his audience hates "Lberals" whoever they are.   And I find rather pathetic that he calls himself a devout Christian when the fact is Christianity's teachings are the most liberal-leftist thing out there.	PhilMacCracks	t3_6dkl71

Huh.

So their basic premise is not even correct. Huh. Conservative "sources" lied. How about that.  I'm aware that they have an "email" but they're the only sources that claim to have that email, and none of the interviews of the professor mention that at all.

Got into it with my stepdad the other night and he condescendingly implied that "Since when was Russia was such a threat?  The Cold War ended with Reagan."  Like seriously?  What the fuck happened last year to all of their little brains that they actually forgot that Russia was their enemy number 1 forever until Trump came along?

t3_6dkl71	t1_di3fosf	1495846575	A bit off topic but kind of related and funny (at least to me). I went to University of Portland in the 80s and we played soccer at Evergreen - it was a very very hippy type place back then.

t3_6dkl71	t1_di3fxyj	1495846955	Yeah. I know of it's reputation as kind of a hippie campus too.  But from looking at a lot of different videos, it appears the following happened:  1) There was discussion about hiring practices for faculty on campus.  2) In response this professor did say an email that he would be protesting a racial diversity event, day of absence in which students and faculty can take the day off to attend seminars as described in the link.  3) That is only part of the overall upset and it seems like this is part of a larger issue at the campus between students and faculty? But I'm not sure what that is.  But the spin on "Day without whites" blatantly false. And, for reference, I don't think the professor is racist, but extremely bad at listening to the concerns of his students. The behavior on Twitter is pretty concerning for someone who's supposed to teach.	sdfsfdsfsdfddfffd	t1_di3fosf

t3_6dkl71	t1_di3gvc0	1495848364	It doesn't. Because what you posted is made up. Interviews with the professor specify that the issue is about a disagreement with hiring practices. He decided to voice that disagreement by protesting day of absence which is not a "day without whites" event. The event takes place on campus as well. So even the basic premise of asking him to leave campus for the event is false. &gt;At the same time, we offer a full-day, on-campus educational and social program designed to address issues from the perspective of people of color.  And his email was not in protest the event or the idea of the event. It was in protest for his own ideas about faculty hiring practices. He even says in that video you linked that the event has been there longer than he's been hired.	sdfsfdsfsdfddfffd	t1_di3gnj5

If you didn't know anything about how Congressional politics worked, you'd think that this made no sense, but in fact it is obvious once you realize that to many Congressmen, military spending is a jobs program for their district/state.  Some firms in the US employ people to make parts and equipment for the A-10.  The military doesn't want to buy their wares anymore, but congress keeps forcing the military to buy it, just so those jobs stay in those/that district(s), or so the donations from the defense industry keep coming.

Also stop forcing the military to buy things like C-130's that no one wants because they already have too many. As for the A-10, the Air Force hates it because it doesn't fit the operating model they want. They much prefer dropping bombs from high altitude off aircraft that carry less and cost more, they hate close air support.  I am not saying the a-10 is is the only answer but it's a paid for program that has been highly effective.	Vanguard55	t1_di3rcpb

t3_6dmdae	t1_di3s6t8	1495871235	I do know what CAS is thank you. An airframe that executes CAS missions is considered a platform. Just as a submarine can be considered a multi mission platform.  The A10 still performs very well in its designated role against pretty much all current ground based threats. It was never intended to face off against interceptors or multi role aircraft.  I disagree, obviously. The main reason the AF would like to retire the A-10 appears to be that they would like to buy F-35's. That is not surprising, as Lockheed Martin is pushing extremely hard for the branches to purchase their airframe.  According to data I've seen the A-10 performed between 13 to 24% of all CAS ops between 2009 to the present. Not bad for an old tank killer.  Ironically, the replacements being considered for the the A10's are piston jobs. Cheaper but not as survivable.	Vanguard55	t1_di3rsp6

Just as a submarine can be considered a multi mission platform.  My point is the A-10 isn't some main CAS platform.  &gt;&gt;  The A10 still performs very well in its designated role against pretty much all current ground based threats. It was never intended to face off against interceptors or multi role aircraft.  Except, again, it's almost never used and hasn't been used because, it isn't aircraft that are the problem.  http://elementsofpower.blogspot.com/2011/07/debunking-close-air-support-myths-part_27.html  &gt;&gt; General Chuck Horner, the 'Air Boss' in Desert Storm, gets to have the last word on whether the A-10 or an A-10 'like' platform qualifies as the 'best' CAS tool in the future  &gt;&gt; Q: Did the war have any effect on the Air Force's view of the A-10?  &gt;&gt; A: No. People misread that. People were saying that airplanes are too sophisticated and that they wouldn't work in the desert, that you didn't need all this high technology, that simple and reliable was better, and all that.  &gt;&gt; Well, first of all, complex does not mean unreliable. We're finding that out. For example, you have a watch that uses transistors rather than a spring. It's infinitely more reliable than the windup watch that you had years ago. That's what we're finding in the airplanes.  &gt;&gt; Those people . . . were always championing the A-10. As the A-10 reaches the end of its life cycle-- and it's approaching that now--it's time to replace it, just like we replace every airplane, including, right now, some early versions of the F-16.  &gt;&gt; Since the line was discontinued, [the A-10's champions] want to build another A-10 of some kind. The point we were making was that we have F-16s that do the same job.  &gt;&gt; Then you come to people who have their own reasons-good reasons to them, but they don't necessarily compute to me-who want to hang onto the A-10 because of the gun. Well, the gun's an excellent weapon, but you'll find that most of the tank kills by the A-10 were done with Mavericks and bombs. So the idea that the gun is the absolute wonder of the world is not true.  &gt;&gt; Q: This conflict has shown that?  &gt;&gt; A: It shows that the gun has a lot of utility, which we always knew, but it isn't the principal tank-killer on the A-10. The [Imaging Infrared] Maverick is the big hero there. That was used by the A-10s and the F-16s very, very effectively in places like Khafji.  &gt;&gt; The other problem is that the A-10 is vulnerable to hits because its speed is limited. It's a function of thrust, it's not a function of anything else. We had a lot of A-10s take a lot of ground fire hits. Quite frankly, we pulled the A-10s back from going up around the Republican Guard and kept them on Iraq's [less formidable] front-line units. That's line [sic] if you have a force that allows you to do that. In this case, we had F-16s to go after the Republican Guard. Q: At what point did you do that?  &gt;&gt; A: I think I had fourteen airplanes sitting on the ramp having battle damage repaired, and I lost two A- 10s in one day [February 15], and I said, "I've had enough of this." ....  A-10s are a joke.    &gt;&gt; I disagree, obviously. The main reason the AF would like to retire the A-10 appears to be that they would like to buy F-35's. That is not surprising, as Lockheed Martin is pushing extremely hard for the branches to purchase their airframe.  Yeah, why should we buy the most advanced aircraft ever built.    &gt;&gt; According to data I've seen the A-10 performed between 13 to 24% of all CAS ops between 2009 to the present. Not bad for an old tank killer.  A plane that can only carry out CAS is 13-24% and you don't see a problem with that?   &gt;&gt; Ironically, the replacements being considered for the the A10's are piston jobs. Cheaper but not as survivable.  The goal is to NOT be hit, friend.	pizzashill	t1_di3s6t8

In exchange though it gives even more power than what the mega corporations have now, as the governments would be even more starved for money and with even less control on the economy.  On the other hand it would lessen the suffering of a lot of people by providing a minimum standard of living. Furthermore it would give disenfranchised minds the time and peace to reflect on the current world situation and come to conclusions less clouded by propaganda and half truths that we have no time to research and confirm because of our busy lives.

He's not even holding them accountable for their $124 billion in administrative waste that was identified last year.    &gt; The Air Force budget deputy, Maj. Gen. James F.

Once the unemployed population grows to a significant percentage Government has to control some means of production to provide basic necessities (food, housing, medical, education, etc).  On top of that work laws need to be changed to split up the labor so that people can still earn for "luxuries". 10 or 20 hour work week, etc.  These are of course all intermediate steps until 100% automation in a few hundred years.	rtfm-ish	t1_di3sr5v
t3_6dmkmt	t1_di3t6nn	1495874332	I agree with you but that's only because I have very little faith in our current system to implement the basic income properly.      Maybe I'm mistaken but I've always thought the correct way to go about it would be **almost** profit neutral to the large corporations at first due to the HEAVY taxes they would need to pay, and those taxes (which would increase quarterly if needed) would then be used to give everyone a living wage.	Chefca	t1_di3sr5v
t3_6dmkmt	t1_di3tb14	1495874716	A far better idea would be for the government to provide the basic necessities: housing, water, food, internet (added this last one because without it the chances of better one's lot in life are pretty close to zero).  Central control of this may not be the best solution however. Having local administrations owning farms, water sources, land and tools to allow the community to create what it needs would be better.  What I mean is the communities themselves should organize to provide its members with the basic necessities and the government rather than providing them directly should give the tools and space to allow it.	hexalby	t1_di3t630

t3_6dmdae	t1_di3thob	1495875315	Every grunt I know would very much prefer an A-10 over high altitude aircraft. Why? Because a pilot with eyes actually on target can see if it's a hostile or not. A B1 at 30k cannot. Yes, I know quite a few ground pounders that have gone to exotic places and blown them up.  To the contrary, it's used quite a bit. Flight hours back that up.  I disagree that the A10 is a joke. I also disagree that tech is the solution to the problem. It is painfully obvious that nothing I can say will change your mind slightest.  As for the F35, it's the real joke. The marines and navy did not want it. The Air Force was underwhelmed at its performance. It was outflown by an F-16 and most of the reports I've seen state that the pilots hate it.  It's a dedicated platform. It performs the roles it designed for better than any of the multi roles. It's also cheaper per flight hour, cheaper to build and cheaper to maintain. 9 mil a pop vs 150mil for an F35.  You do realize that the prop aircraft are inferior in almost every respect. If you are flying low, you are going to get hit.  In any given battle space it is assumed we have air superiority. You are not sending B1s , F15E's or F16's configured for ground attack into unsecured airspace. Hence you would not send an A10 either.   I do not consider myself a "Fanboy". I however detest the AF's insistence that tech and altitude solves everything. I could give two craps about the 30mm. It's the dedicated payload ability, SCAR, FAR ,and CAS abilities that sway me toward keeping the things. Not to mention I do know some folks who were actually helped out of right spots by A10 support. I was Navy , but military history and military hardware are actual hobbies of mine  and were at points in my career professional interest.   I take a pretty pragmatic view of most things. If we really wanted tech we'd have swarms of combat drones that could pull more gees than humans could stand. All controlled from In theatre bases and having limited AI (all elements of which have actually been tested). That way we could actually offset some of the numerical superiority Russia and China enjoy. Added benefit, you don't have to train a new pilot when a drone dies.   https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/05/26/congress-saves-the-a-10-warthog-for-now.aspx  http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421473/f-35-defense-waste-danger	Vanguard55	t1_di3s9p1

Because a pilot with eyes actually on target can see if it's a hostile or not. A B1 at 30k cannot. Yes, I know quite a few ground pounders that have gone to exotic places and blown them up.

I'm sorry there's a cult around the A-10, but the plane is done - it is not good at its job, it's inferior to other planes, it can't even be used in a contested environment.  And you're absolutely correct - there's nothing you can say that will change my mind, because my opinion was formed based on what the facts say, and what credible experts say - not how the "grunts" feel.	pizzashill	t1_di3thob

Two guns where stolen from an FBI vehicle hours before his murder. No official report says which hospital he was taken too, none. There are no bodycam footage from the officers on the scene. His family have a DNC crisis manager as their spokesman. Seemingly no effort is being made by police to find his killers.  If he was just murdered why is there no investigation or information available about the murder. Democrats should be just as interested in solving the case but instead you brush it off and attack people who are interested in solving the case.  Nobody is trying to capitalize on child porn. When a shocking story comes out like that, which is actually true, it's natural lots of people want to talk about it.

F-4's were massacred by obsolete MiG-21s in Vietnam because they didn't have guns.  &gt;&gt; Common F-4 myth  &gt;&gt; When Vietnam started, USAF and Navy F-4's claimed just a 2:1 kill/loss ratio. Here commentators often blamed malfunctioning missiles and lack of a gun.  &gt;&gt; So the USAF added a gun to the F-4, but their K/L remained at 2:1.  &gt;&gt; In contrast, the Navy began a new program to better train pilots how to use their missiles. They also trained the maintenance crews how to properly handle and maintain their missiles. They did not add a gun.  &gt;&gt; By war's end, the "sluggish" Navy F-4's claimed a 12:1 K/L ratio against its more maneuverable adversaries like the "agile" MiG-21.  &gt;&gt; That training program? It became TOPGUN. (Source.)  &gt;&gt; Welcome to the BVR missile era  &gt;&gt; The last fighter v. fighter guns kill was in 1989, an Iranian F-4E shooting down an Iraqi Su-22 (CSBA).

If the gov't borrows money to pay for it from outside the country or prints new money to pay for it, then it might cause inflation. Inflation mainly happens when there is an increase in demand that pushes up the general price level. If you're taking income from higher income earners and giving it lower income earners the general price level probably won't increase, though it could increase inflation in some markets while decreasing it in others.	buzzit292	t1_di424ke

No, literally the primary reason for that gun was because people thought that's why it was losing to older migs.    &gt;&gt; As you pointed out the problem wasn't just the plane, we thought because of the plane we no longer taught pilots the basic of air to air combat.   But that isn't true - pilots were still trained in air combat, they still learned the basics - they weren't trained in how to correctly use rockets.   &gt;&gt; The F-35 is a great testbed for the next gen of fighters but we are still going to need a dedicated air superiority platform  There's no reason why the f-35 couldn't be an "air superiority" fighter because as I've shown you - there is more than likely never going to be another visual range "dog-fight."  It's just not going to happen - missiles and electronics have become some advanced your best route of defense is to simply not be seen.    &gt;&gt; We are still going to need a dedicated close air support platform.  You know multi-role fighters carried out the vast majority of CAS in recent wars, right? Cas is a mission - it isn't a platform. The one plane you could consider a "cas" platform can't be used in contested environments, how do you carry out CAS if you're getting shot down?  I think it'd do you good to read this:  http://elementsofpower.blogspot.com/2011/07/debunking-close-air-support-myths-part.html  A relevant line:  &gt;&gt; As noted previously, the A-10 design was from the very start designed to be operated in a ‘permissive environment’. This limitation had been a concern of AF planners since the A-10’s inception, and its vulnerability to weapons larger than those it was designed to encounter became more of a concern with the advent and proliferation of Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADs) such as the SA-7 (and successors) as well as increases in numbers and types of larger mobile systems that filled the gap between short range low-altitude MANPADs and longer-range high-altitude fixed site systems (SA-2/3s and successors).

Metaphorically: You have a suspected burglar and evidence that suggests he has robbed 10 homes.  He then announces that he may rob a home.  Then he says "nah, I'm not gonna do it."

The low level fire missions that are anti-personal and anit-tactical, clean out enemies who have reinforced positions.  2. You are comparing its stats to other fixed wing aircraft but that is a mistake. The A-10 can operate like an attack helo but with the range of the a fixed wing.

Who do they think is going to pay for their medical costs if they get catastrophically ill/injured, as some of them inevitably will?    Unless they actually commit suicide rather than accept society's or their family's handout they are leeching off of the rest of us -- because society (as a whole) does not and will not willingly withhold medical care from individuals whose lives depend on it. That is why universal coverage is essential from every possible standpoint -- it engenders the most cost effective, most humane and fairest public health system possible.	ollokot	t3_6dq0hh

If I could find a group of conservatives who have that down then I would love to talk to them, but I unfortunately haven't found them yet in the Trump era.

t3_6dss5f	t1_di54mca	1495962924	Agreed. Healthy environments are a privilege of wealthy countries and are predominantly found in healthy, capitalist countries. Forest land in the United States is actually increasing, and I'd prefer to swim in its rivers than China's. Positive choices are made by people who have the wealth to be able to make those choices. Free markets allow for weath and wealth allows for clean environments.  Clean is more expensive than dirty. Is a house cleaner when the wife stays at home or when both parents work? If you want a clean environment, you should want freer, capitalist markets. Economies are weakened when freedoms, through forced economics, are reduced.	SparklingGenitals	t1_di548wk

t3_6dss5f	t1_di55511	1495964627	The modern American corporate economy is *always* about short term gains. Solving climate change needs a long term solution, one that will not increase this quarter's profits.  If the "free market" was a solution to climate change, climate change would no longer be a problem. We've been doing a "free market solution" since the 80s. See how that worked out?	justiceslade	t1_di54tat
t3_6dss5f	t1_di557qf	1495964872	&gt; Yes, because protecting markets is far more important than protecting our ecosystem...  Absolutely it is.  It's human nature, really. If your family was freezing and you lived next to the one tree left in a barren land, which also happened to contain an endangered species, you'd still cut it down to keep your family warm. Anyone would. Nobody chooses the tree over their family. You'd be lying if you said otherwise.  But if you had one tree left yet you could afford propane heat, you'd choose propane. Everyone would (yes, yes, exceptions, but ok, 99% would).  Economics is the first choice over environment, whether politicians want it to be or not.  Of course, go educate people on how to make the best decision, or even what the best decision is. Heck, in part I do that for a career. But nobody is going to make that more-expensive better decision until they have the money to do so. Yes, the market comes first.  All the "green" and enviro-products on the shelves are a good example. They don't have to be there at all, but the market has demanded it. People who are able to spend more for the products and are educated about the issues, are making the free choice to buy them. The people who aren't buying them are the ones who can't afford the extra $1. So don't harm the market with taxes and regulations in the name of climate so that more people have that extra $1 and are able to make the better choice.	SparklingGenitals	t1_di54uj2

t3_6dss5f	t1_di55r1l	1495966665	Looking on the bright side, the USA at the federal level was already hobbled by a Republican Congress, so much of the good work was already happening at the state or city level or within large corporations like Tesla (on the supply side) or Microsoft (on the demand side, they have an internal carbon tax and reinvest the money to make themselves more efficient) so while a Clinton presidency may have been a minor positive, the Republicans would have stymied most progress at that level anyway.

t3_6dul3g	t1_di5iwqu	1495991319	I make this point from time to time.  The reason so much of the globe was ok with the world order was because it conceived of the US as stable, ruled by law not nepotism, and rational.  That the US elected Trump has broken that conception.    The US has been laid bare as a country that contrary to all prior expectations in the post WWII world order isn't stable, is prepared to allow its president to flout the law and practice extreme nepotism in government, and which cannot be trusted to not irrationally put someone like Trump into the presidency.  This cannot be unbroken.	slanaiya	t1_di5gvkl
t3_6dusfe	t1_di5j08g	1495991446	A rational conclusion.  Trump saying "I'll decide when I get back to the US" means "when I get back, I'll let my handlers tell me what to decide."	Dustin_00	t3_6dusfe

t3_6dul3g	t1_di5jazx	1495991837	American here.    Our electoral process has become corrupted by money.  Because of our two-stage election (the primary election determines the candidates in the general election) and dominance of just two parties, we usually get one or two bad choices in the general election (and few people bother to vote in the primary, even though it's arguably more important to do so).  This creates an opening for money and corruption.  It took Bernie out of the race for our Democratic (left) party, and our Republican (right) party has kept new-idea challengers like Ron Paul on the fringes for years.    That's how we got Hillary vs Trump.  It's worth noting that at the time of our election, both candidates were disliked a lot more than they were liked.  Almost any 'normal' politician from either party could have beaten both of them.  But because the only alternatives were 3rd parties (guaranteed to lose), it was a Hillary vs Trump election.  At the end of the day though, Trump won not because we all love him (we don't) but because there are a LOT of Americans who see their jobs going away and the country being given away to the companies who are shipping their jobs overseas.  Trump presented himself as a candidate to fight that process.  Hillary's brain-dead campaign strategy didn't even bother stopping in many of those middle America states, and even if she did, her platform didn't talk much about jobs leaving the country or how to restore our middle class.    Thus, President Trump.    Now as an American with a suitably independent spirit, I think every sovereign nation should "fight for its own destiny" (as Merkel put it).  But I also think we must make alliances, with the overall goal of coming together as a species to tackle our mutual problems together.    There was a time, back in the 80s and 90s, when America was seen as the peacemakers.  Since our 'global war on terror' we've fucked that up, now we just get our fingers in other people's shit and cause problems for everyone else.  Sorry about that.

Countries are leaving the EU, Russia and Turkey both have been more aggressive and radical in the past few years, and the rising problem of ISIS will certainly take a financial toll on the EU.  Especially compounded by the many, many, many other problems the EU has faced over the last decade and that the European people are getting increasingly sick of.

But why did Comey treat both campaigns, both under investigation for very different issues, so differently?   For one thing, the Russians can make up any damn fake intelligence they like. Anything - they can just lie. Why would the director look at a piece of evidence he knows is fake, and then say he's going to act like its real? Mildly nauseous, my ass.

t3_6dw2g8	t1_di5t7bh	1496005088	I agree - since both (then candidates) Clinton and Trump had ongoing investigations, it's unclear why Comey was forthcoming, even just to Congress, about one over the other? Particularly since the gravity and reach of the one he did not divulge was significantly greater than that of the one he did (IMHO).    That being said, my issue with Graham is I don't trust him to diligently and ethically be part of investigating anyone.

While I'm not certain he tipped the election, he definitely had huge potential to influence it, and I'm in similar disagreement with his actions.  Albeit, as a layperson who doesn't understand all the regulatory norms or have all the secret info.  For one thing, this most recent revelation with the bad intel makes it look like he might have been more concerned with making the FBI *look* good (uninfluenced) than *be* good.  Like keeping public trust in the FBI was more important than the FBI actually being trustworthy.  Secondly, even with the announcement, why did he offer an opinion on Clinton's actions instead of just a "no crime here" type of "just the facts" verdict?  Am I misunderstanding that they aren't supposed to do that?  &gt;What I want to know, is what the fuck is going on?  Agreed.

Ok, but both campaigns were under investigation. And as he himself noted in the first House hearing, there is not crime of 'collusion' in the criminal code. The Trump campaign was under investigation for treason. Why did the 'world of leaks' not enter into his actions there?  I'm sorry I just don't buy it. I want to see Trump taken down as much as the next .... I just can't understand either Comey's 'extremely careless' comment, nor his reasoning for announcing the reopening of the investigation.

I refuse to believe that the FBI couldn't have known within 20 minutes that the emails on Weiner's laptop did not contain ones that Clinton's staff tried to hide from them. Comey already knew when he wrote that letter to Chaffetz - he already knew that if ever it was to 'leak' that he could refute it unequivocally.	WMD3210	t1_di5tifm

The unnamed sources WAPO and NYT use to report that the email is fake is suspicious as hell.  How did the FBI determine this email was a fake?  Did it look fake, or do they have the raw data proving it a fake.  Don't think they have the raw data bc the DNC refused the FBI access to examine the hacked DNC server.  While I think Graham is a self hating closet homosexual asshat he is correct that something isn't right regarding the email and Comey's handling of the situation.  I wouldn't be surprised though, due to the Lynch/Clinton tarmac meeting, and the email leaks showing Bernie was screwed by DNC insiders that the email is real and Lynch never intended to prosecute any actual criminal violations by HRC.  Comey's excuse that they couldn't prove intent was bullshit as intent isn't an element of the law.	BankofStokes	t1_di5svyt

I mean the more that tumbles out of this the more it seems to narrow to two options: Either he made a grossly incompetent decision and was, like many of us, over confident that Clinton would win, OR the darker possibility that he felt he might own a President (There was an FBI director in the past who operated this way).

Yes, you're right about the emails and there were a variety of different ways they could have filtered most of the emails. I think they did.. even using the best Text mining techniques the variability can tip the accuracy measures a lot.. they couldn't afford that so they chose to manually read 6k out of 100k emails. They could have lied that they used an advance algorithm that parsed through all of them and nothing was found but that's just it he chooses not to lie and it comes at a great expense.	neoArmstrongCannon90	t1_di5tr0o

t3_6dw2g8	t1_di5yorf	1496013238	The Trump campaign was not under investigation for treason,  The Trump campaign was under investigation for what communication was going on between Russians and members of Trumps campaign.  It wasn't about investigation of a crime, it was about discovering if a crime had been committed.  Like finding a body doesn't mean you start investigating for murder until you first determine a cause of death.  Find out what happened and if you start to suspect a crime, then try to figure out who did it.  However you and I are not privy to enough information as to what crimes, if any, the FBI had reached a point of suspecting.  One major difference between the FBI handling of Clinton and Trump was simply that it was already known in Fall of '15 or Winter of '16 that Clinton was being investigated.  That put the FBI and Comey in a difficult spot because then anything they did would be viewed politically.  If the FBI recommended indictment, Comey was a Republican stooge and the fix was in against Clinton.  If the FBI did not recommended indictment, Clinton was a political insider and the fix was in to protect her.  Comey had to be more public than usual to try to get the FBI out of the middle of the political ramifications  On the other hand, nobody realized the FBI was investigating Trump.  So to protect his sources and the investigation process he could keep that investigation under wraps.  He did at one point want to go public but Obama stopped him,  In short, the Clinton investigation was publicly known so Comey had to be more publicly transparent; the Trump investigation was _not_ publicly known so Comey kept it that way.

But I'm firmly in the camp that the tragedy and deaths on 9/11 were leveraged to erode a lot of things that made this country great.

t3_6dw2g8	t1_di5zjly	1496014590	His main mistake wasn't in writing a letter to congress, his mistake was how he phrased it and then not clarifying it immediately after it was take wrong way. The letter should have emphasized and strongly stated this: &gt;there is no reason to believe the conclusion would change, that the emails may be all duplicates and even if some are not there would be no reason to presume those emails would change the outcome. That they are examining them in order to leave no stone unturned, but do not presume to find anything.  That needed said in the letter and it needed shouted by comey after everyone went nuts over the letter. Instead, crickets.   The press conference was also excessive, he went too far in giving his opinion. A notch or two lower would have been appropriate, given the circumstances of the election and the role of the FBI. That Russian email is trickier, because it is pretty obvious chaffetz and the other goons would have treated it as real and the media would have too. If the Russians had dropped that email, his press conference may have given him more credibility to shoot it down. But it is unknown if he would have done that.	coffeeisking	t1_di5syke
t3_6dwg0u	t1_di60ctb	1496015891	Trump got a little taste of it when he fired missiles into the Syrian airfield, and politicians and reporters were fawning over his "bravery and presidential-ness". Granted, his approval rating barely saw a spike from that, but I wouldn't put it past someone like Bannon to take it even further.  His attitude towards Islam and repeated attempts at a Muslim ban have done nothing but fuel the fires behind ISIS. He does it under the guise of national security, but in reality, he's just making it even worse.  Back when he tried to pass the Muslim ban the first time, there was a NYT reporter stationed in Iraq (I think?). She said that IS leaders were absolutely celebrating the fact that they had finally gotten to America's leaders. They were calling it "the blessed ban".  I fear for this country if Trump is given a reason and the means to push his awful agenda. He could do far more to hurt America than terrorists could ever do.	legomaniac89	t1_di5z5ak

It was the party of Catholics and Jews, who were shunned by Protestants, and African-Americans, who were unable to vote in the South and live where they pleased in the North.  &gt; In common, they were looked down upon by the nation's ruling elite. Then President Franklin Roosevelt transformed the outsiders into insiders by bringing them all into the Democratic Party. That ended the long Republican dominance of Washington.

t3_6dul3g	t1_di61ekh	1496017582	You talk a lot about the executive branch, but fact is the corrupting influence of money in politics is felt much more strongly in the legislative branch, both at the federal and state level. Congress has crazy low approval ratings overall, but incumbents almost always win and often run unopposed. Why? The money isn't there for a challenger. Incumbents have the advantage, and some donor can give them a couple hundred thousand bucks, and the new guy is SOL.   A huge portion of this has to do with the fact that we allow political campaigns to essentially be shadow funded. Money is counted as political expression, and the will of the rich is much more likely to be passed than the 'unrepresented' poor. This could be fixed EASILY, is clearly undemocratic, and is a non-issue in most other western democracies.   Similarly,  because we were"early adopters" of the whole democracy thing, we've got some bugs in our voting systems. Antiquated and broken concepts like the electoral college and FPTP voting (as well as not adjusting the # of seats in the House of Reps for almost 100 years) seriously throw a wrench into the works. Also we vote during business hours on a Tuesday? And that's not even getting to gerrymandering, which doesn't make any sense to some one with an ounce of reason who isn't from here.   But all those things require massive political capital that doesn't exist, and many would require a certain party to be in control (seeing as how conservatives would never). Which is increasingly unlikely, as conservatives here in the US have been trying to surpress the vote and drive down turnout numbers.	Madmans_Endeavor	t1_di5jazx
t3_6dx4ms	t1_di61k6w	1496017833	I agree but part of problem is that the DNC is now essentially both poilitcal parties in the US. The clinton vs Sanders debate was essentially the actual presidential debate. Both sides had different visions for the country and they debated them substantively. The GOP isnt a political party any longer.  Its a radical insurgency.  So you have the DNC who has to compromise within its own party between both factions of what used to be considered conservative principles and the other faction of what used to be considered liberal principles. Then they have to deal with the nutters of the GOP after they strike a deal within their own party.     Its doomed from the start they cannot come up with a coherent message because what essentially is two different parties residing in one party. If the GOP does die then the DNC will essentially become the home of conservatives and hopefully  a new leftist party will grow.	thechapattack	t3_6dx4ms

t3_6dx4ms	t1_di653rx	1496023626	The strength of the party is its ability to welcome so many to it for so many different reasons. That's also its weakness. The GOP has a far easier time organizing because it really only needs to speak to a few demographic segments to mobilize them.   I worry that the party will spend so much time convincing disparate and sometimes even oppositional groups to work together on messaging bigger and more meaningful than "we're not Republicans." How do we get all these widely divergent groups to see one another as a collective "Us" instead of a small bunch of "us" and a whole lot of "Them?"   Republicans have gone far (*too* far) on their purported core tenets of small government, strong defense, Christian values, anti-abortion, pro-business, and American exceptionalism. They don't even offer most of these things anymore, at least not in their true form (they do have a kind of funhouse-mirror version of some of them). But their base believes they stand for these things, that they're the real patriots in this country.   We have to get back to liberalism in its truest sense -- not the GOP's boogeyman version of it that's built on warring identity politics, but the kind of liberalism that opposes authoritarianism. The Republicans have dropped the mantle of patriotism (though not jingoism; they have that in abundance), and trampled it in the dust in their rush to authoritarian rule. Democrats absolutely must pick it up again and find reasons for voters on the left to embrace it.   The GOP has ceded the field. Democrats have to take it and plant a flag that represents something more than a collection of identities bound by a common hatred. I totally get what the original author was saying here: We need to be defined by more than our individual identities. We need at least some of the 52 percent of white women who voted for a repulsive pussy-grabber to see more in the Democratic party than identity politics.   It's always been the tougher task to make a party out of diversity than to root one within the classes that already have more power.	EllaShue	t1_di61z8g

It's completely out of control, and the campuses which present only a liberal point of view are creating more intolerance and harming the students by giving them a very one-sided education. We do college students no favors by creating "safe spaces" where they are shielded from viewpoints that they do not agree with; there are no safe spaces once they get out of the purified atmosphere of academia. Now there's nothing wrong with being liberal, conservative, or moderate in itself but students are living in a bubble and are allowed to live like this.  Listening to conservatives speak if you are liberal isn't going to kill you and really should be part of a full education. The majority of the US really isn't like college campuses, anyhow. Unless the students end up living and working in large cities they are going to be surrounded by moderates and conservatives once they get into the real world.  Nothing worse than intolerance and an unwillingness to at least listen--even if you know you are likely to disagree.  There really isn't an issue as far as liberals and conservatives agreeing on WHAT the issues are--it's just disagreements on HOW to fix the issues.	kellymcneill	t3_6dyiga

Everything I wrote applies to both, the only difference is executive branch elections get more press attention.    I think it's not just that money isn't there, it's more that the people don't pay attention to Congressional elections.  Remember we get 65ish % voter turnout, in a hotly contested Presidential election, and we consider that huge.  In a midterm election, turnout is much much less- midterm elections haven't crossed the 45% mark since 1970, and are generally around 40% since.  That means 3 out of 5 registered voters can't be bothered to huff it to the polls.  THAT is our problem.    The result is the only ones who do vote are the real party faithful.  With few eyes on the election, it's easy for shitty candidates to keep getting re-elected.    And as you say, business hours on a Tuesday (that's not a national holiday) is absurd.    For fixing it, political capital won't help.  The Dems did nothing to fix it when they had control of Congress, and the GOP won't fix it either.  Don't blame conservatives for all our problems.    If this is to be fixed, the people as a whole must *demand* that it be fixed.  But that requires the people to pay attention to the electoral process and demand change.  And demanding change means *doing things*- writing letters, calling representatives, and aggressively supporting candidates who are in favor of change (especially in primary elections).  Nothing else will make this happen.    Unfortunately these days a few Likes on Facebook counts as 'political engagement' so I'm not holding my breath for any action this decade.	SirEDCaLot	t1_di61ekh

No joke, granted this was in the Midwest, and we had to let bat shit insane preachers onto our campus twice a year. The preachers would stand there tell everyone walking on the quad they were going to hell, for whatever reason they could make up at the moment.   I do have a problem with Milo and Ann Coulter though. Neither of them are real conservatives, and they actually have followings that could injure people on campuses if they would be allowed to be taken seriously. With how much Ann Coulter hates immigrants I could see some idiot listen to her speak and getting an idea to vandalize a foreign exchange students car, and the same with Milo and women.

Trump is trying to get the rest of NATO to pay its agreed amount that they haven't been paying, and putting American industry ahead of others. One specific in the article is that Trump called the Germans evil for over-saturating the automobile market. I'm sure Trump would rather have less Germans cars in favor of American cars. The threat of withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord is also economically based. That agreement basically gives Germany and other EU countries a ridiculous amount of benefits in the name of fighting climate change, while the other participants will not have such benefits.	aiello2k57	t3_6dyv57

t3_6dz53o	t1_di6grxa	1496048649	Sure! I'll discuss it!  The headline and article are meant to dispute something that they don't give us access to. They state that Feinstein made this claim:  &gt;Flynn told Rice to hold off, “a move that would delay the military operation for months” — according to a timeline prepared by the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)  But they don't link to the timeline that makes this claim. The original McClatchy article has that quoted line in it, but it's not attributed to Feinstein:  &gt;According to timelines distributed by members of Congress in the weeks since, Flynn told Rice to hold off, a move that would delay the military operation for months.  In fact, the McClatchy article doesn't say that the members of congress stated Flynn's decision is the reason the move was delayed.   The Breitbart article then says this:  &gt;But Dunford, who was appointed to the position in 2015 by President Obama, said that Flynn’s decision did not cause any delay in the assault on Raqqa, which has not yet begun:  Yet the reporter and Dunford's remarks are this:  &gt;REPORTER: I’d like to ask the — the two veterans of the Obama administration if the decision at the end of the Obama administration to hold off on arming the [Kurds] and let the Trump administration make that decision, did that have any effect or delaying the assault on Raqqah?  &gt;DUNFORD: Yeah, David, I — I can — I can answer that question directly. It did not.  &gt;One of the — one of the preconditions for seizing Raqqah was the isolation of Raqqa, which included — just recently completed a very difficult fight in an area called Tabqa. And I think you’re familiar with that, where the Syrian Democratic Forces actually had 100 killed in that battle alone.  &gt;So, we are just at about the point where the seizure of Raqqah would’ve taken place in a normal course of events. So, it has not delayed the seizure of Raqqah.  So, the reporter didn't ask about Flynn, and Dunford didn't mention Flynn.   Mattis is quoted in the article:  &gt;MATTIS: Only now are we completing the encirclement of Raqqah and there’s been no delay in the effort to do that other than the normal vagaries of the battlefield where we have to deal with an enemy who’s trying to defeat us.  But he doesn't mention Flynn.   So...why is this article about Flynn? The McClatchy article doesn't say that Congress thought Flynn's decision affected anything, and Breitbart doesn't link to the timeline it claims Feinstein made that specifically mentioned Flynn as the reason the operation was delayed.   Finally:  Who was this reporter? When were these remarks made? In what context? Glaring lack of transparency here on the part of Breitbart.   And all of this is being done to try and deflect from the thing Flynn has already admitted to, which is that he received money from a Turkish business owner who was appointed to a board by the Turkish government.	colby-klaus	t1_di6g53j

Sorry dude, but your party is a party of whiny bitches, frauds, and con men. All they do is fuck everything up. They destroyed the entire economy last time they were in power. Then they engaged in egregious, unprecedented obstructionism for 8 years, blocking everything the president did (who demolished your shitty ass Republican candidates in the elections). They have zero respect for the constitution and zero integrity. And now that they're in power again, they can't do anything right.

t3_6dyp4r	t1_di6ny4r	1496066419	It is their constitutional duty to vote on the president's nominees.  Bitch McConnell and his cronies did not do that. They executed what was basically a pocket veto on Garland for 9 months. News flash: **They do not have the constitutional right to do that.** Those 11 senators do not have the right to indefinitely block the ability of the president to nominate a justice.   Jesus, do conservatives *try* to be ignorant of US government? Or do ignorant people just naturally become conservatives?  The hilarious thing that conservatives don't realize is that now that they've set this shitty precedent, Democrats will just do the same thing. Given how much the country hates our terrible president, the Democrats could easily win the senate in 2018. And then, if a justice dies or retires, guess what's going to happen? The same shit that McConnell did. The Democrats will block whatever dog shit justice Drumpf nominates for the rest of the term.

t3_6dyp4r	t1_di6o5m4	1496066761	Its was the Dems who started playing around with procedure when they changed appointments to be only 51 needed for confirmation of lower appointments.

t3_6dyp4r	t1_di6o6sh	1496066815	I agree, to point. If a Republican wants to act like an adult and debate the merits of certain policy positions and how they affect their constituents, fantastic.

t3_6dyp4r	t1_di6p3ib	1496068290	&gt;Its was the Dems who started playing around with procedure   After whiny Republicans decided to go full obstructionist and block every single nomination Obama made. He could not do his constitutional duty because Republicans abused the shit out of the filibuster purely out of partisanship. So the Dems had to remove the filibuster for lower court nominations.   Still not unconstitutional, because the constitution does not say anything about senate filibusters.   &gt; The republicans just followed their lead by not voting and apply the 51 to the supreme court also.  The not voting is the unconstitutional part. It is written in the constitution that they vote on the president's nominations. And it wasn't all senate Republicans - only the 11 on the judiciary committee decided to shit on the constitution so they could hand pick a justice who does not remotely reflect the beliefs of Americans.  And why did they have to prevent it from going to a vote? Why didn't they just vote no? Because they were afraid if they took it to a vote that Garland would be confirmed. Because Garland was by far the best for the position and was supported by Republicans.   &gt;If blocking was REALLY unconstitutional then the courts would of intervened already.  It is unconstitutional. It's in the constitution. You do know how to read, right?	drumpfenstein	t1_di6o5m4

There is nothing that you could say that you couldn't also type. Yes you could argue that some things get lost in translation but just clarify your point before you send a message.  I am all for civil discourse and different perspectives as I will never claim to have the most perfect solution to anything. This is what caused the problem we have today in politics imo, however that's not the topic at hand exactly.

You're selling yourself short by choosing to not to communicate here or in my inbox.   My reasoning for not using discord or Skype: I don't know you.

Price levels in China are much lower than the US (a can of coke costs about 35 cents, to give you a vague idea), so you can't compare directly.   A factory worker making 2.5 per hour in China is relatively similar to a factory worker making 7-8 bucks/hr in the US.

This can’t be a relitigation of an election that is now past. This has to be about an objective assessment about the facts that are going on right now.”  How can you argue with that? Do you *want* a rushed impeachment push that fizzles due to prematureness?  Donald Trump's administration is the most corrupt group of politicians America has ever seen, period. We need the case made against them to be watertight so that there are no legitimate doubts about the correct result.

Another problem is that they are trying to cater to a very wide range of people and at that point you usually end up with less then ideal solutions.

t3_6e3zy3	t1_di7jkm1	1496109196	The PCA is a non binding agreement that creates a goal: keep the global temperature rise under 2 Celsius by 2100 annually. The problems are:  We have no idea what the impacts of climate change will be whatsoever. 95% of all climate models are wrong.   There has been no significant warming for the past 20ish years. All of these doomsday predictions have been wrong, so there's no reason to base policy decisions on them.  If the U.S. completely eliminated all co2 emissions, less than 1/5 a degree of warming would be averted by the end of the century. If the entire world did this, the impact would be less than 2/5 of one degree. That's not a temperature reduction, that's averted warming.  Developing counties are the ones who need fossil fuels for energy the most. They don't have the funds or resources to regulate and switch.  Not to mention that we still don't know for sure the impact that humans are having. The increase in co2 flatlines at a certain point while temperature continues to increase, meaning co2 levels are not responsible for warming. And methane, one of the most talked about GHGs, has absolutely no greenhouse effect whatsoever, because all the wavelengths of light it would absorb and reflect, water vapor already does it.  I'm all for protecting the planet and environment for he future, but I'm against destroying the global economy for no benefit.

Like it or not, birth control is also used for valid medical reasons. You want to impose your religious beliefs on other people because you don't agree with a medical practice.  If you truly gave a shit about religious freedom you would fight with us to decouple healthcare from employment and embrace a single-payer Medicare-For-All system. We'd be paying orders of magnitude less than we are now.   If you feel so damn strongly about other people's vaginas I'm sure the Republicans will demand an opt-out for you people who want expensive, private, cutthroat insurance that will be allowed to deny you coverage whenever they damn well please. Have at it.	Firesworn	t1_di7ithr
t3_6e44px	t1_di7jwk3	1496109631	Yes, in that case the employer is imposing beliefs. The employer decides to offer health insurance - they have several choices to make and which provider etc. But it is NOT their choice to make to decide what type of coverage their employees need.   If it includes things they'd rather not have in there, they can charge more for it or even lower wages to offset the expense - they have plenty of options, but they do not belong modifying insurance policies and micro-managing the health of employees.	anonymoushero1	t1_di7hegq

t3_6e44px	t1_di7k0t9	1496109775	I get what you are saying but I need to defend the Jehovah's Witness that I know and knew.   18 years ago I was a branch manager at a service industry wholesale house. Some of my customers were Jehovah's Witness. Any body that knows them knows sooner or later they will give you the religion sale's pitch. Me being a non-believer told them up front and said I wasn't going to change that. They were alway cool about it. Never pressed me again. They were always nice and polite.   My wife and I had a daughter. My Jehovah's Witness customers are the ones that gave us pre-made food dishes. Enough for a month.   I no longer work at that place but I still am in contact with two of my Jehovah's Witness customers. I respect them for their faith and they respect my non-faith. I send them a Season's greeting card every year as a type of joke (they don't do Christmas) and one sends me an Easter card every year.   So, my point is that I don't think a Jehovah's Witness employer would imposes their religious beliefs on others. Now if we were talking about Mormons....	papaHans	t1_di7hcfq

How did society crumble so quickly?  As far as I can tell it started when we allowed Republicans to scream that their ridiculous and dangerous views weren't being given fair treatment and that every opinion on an issue, no matter how idiotic or uninformed, deserves to be treated as equally credible.

t3_6e44px	t1_di7kbks	1496110167	&gt; Not buying you something isn't imposing beliefs on you.

If an employer can refuse to offer health insurance with covers essential services, they are blocking their employees from accessing those health services because of the exorbitant cost of health services in the US.  Rather than offering a normal health insurance plan, which would cover those services, religious exemption laws allow employers to choose plans which explicitly exclude those services. Allowing the employers to impose a financial penalty on their employees who seek health services the employer finds objectionable on religious grounds.  That is an employer imposing their own religious values on their employees.   &gt; People genuinely believe nuns should be forced to violate their conscience so others can have bareback sex for free.  Terrible argument. You could say that nuns are being 'forced to violate their conscience" because they're required to pay their employees who are Muslim. Being a nun doesn't grant them immunity from abiding by the law.	userknamework	t1_di7ithr

I've never seen that 95% statistic before, however there is a strong consensus that whatever the outcome is -  it won't be good.  &gt; There has been no significant warming for the past 20ish years. All of these doomsday predictions have been wrong, so there's no reason to base policy decisions on them.  Quick visit to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_hiatus) (read the citations, they're good), shows a lot of evidence that casts significant doubt on your "no significant warming" claim.   &gt; Instead of wasting our time with the PCA and others like it, we should be researching nuclear fusion ...  Those, are not mutally exclusive events taking place. Politicians and corporations should be making deals like the PCA to protect our present interests. Scientific labs and research universities should be developing alternative energy sources. Both should be happening at the same time.  The PCA is a first step. Maybe it doesn't go far enough... I agree it's not going to cure global warming. However, we don't *HAVE* fusion right now. Since we don't even have energy producing prototypes in scientific labs working yet, it's entirely likely we're going to be in deep shit before that becomes available to attach to the grid.   Besides, we have excellent carbon-free fission right now. But it turns out, pouring all that concrete actually dumps a huge amount of carbon into the atmosphere (building a nuke plant isn't carbon neutral for... I think, 20-30 years?) Not only do we need fusion (which admittedly is a lot smaller and probably doesn't require quite as massive of a facility), we need fusion that is clean to build.  Even if the PCA is just a stall tactic, maybe it buys us time to get to a better solution.  I'd rather be poor and alive than middle class and dead.	JustJSM	t1_di7jkm1

t3_6e5wdy	t1_di7vaiy	1496130678	This is more likely a move to protect US solar manufacturers from what the US views as government subsidies or unfair advantages from other countries. In 2015, about 50% of US oil production was from conventional wells. We still have plenty of conventional oil. Yes, we have way more unconventional reserves as well, but those are going to sit in the ground as long as they are unprofitable, and the state of the US solar market has only a small effect on the current price of oil.  Edit: The US, India, and China are currently battling it out to be the market leader in solar panel production. The WTO recently ruled that India was illegally discriminated against US products, the Chinese have been routinely accused of product dumping by highly subsidizing their solar manufacturers, and Suniva, which just filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, asked Trump to institute an import tariff on foreign solar panels (which is probably where this is coming from).	longhorn617	t1_di7v5n7

t3_6e5wdy	t1_di7vuga	1496132274	Car manufacturers are making more electric cars because there are more people that want to buy electric cars. If there wasn't a significant segment of the population that was demanding these types of cars, the manufacturers wouldn't make them. The price of gas really doesn't have a lot to do with that for manufacturers. Again, they are looking at what the consumers are demanding. If they think that people will want more, then they will make more. If gas prices start rising and people still want traditional ICE cars, that is what they will make.  Also, the "era of oil" isn't going to be over any time soon without any significant government intervention. The US has huge reserves of unconventional oil (larger than Saudi Arabia's current reserves) and a lot of those unconventional oil reserves start becoming profitable around $55-$65/barrel. We will continue to see growth in electric cars, but there is more that goes into it than the price of gas, like the availability of chargers. I live in an apartment, and I would love to have an electric car, but my apartment building doesn't have chargers, and most of the apartment buildings near me that do have chargers only have one or two. Improvements in charging technology would help solve the problem, but until there is significant leaps in fast-charging that are widely available, I don't think this will be moving as fast as some people hope. The increasing fuel efficiency of ICE cars will likely continue, but again, that is because that is what the market is demanding (for more reasons than just money).  In terms of power production, oil is barely even used in the US (~1% of our power comes from oil). Coal will be the first to go, and it will be pushed out of the market by natural gas, a by-product of shale wells. The US is practically swimming in the stuff. Where I am, in Texas, wind is beating natural gas in terms of price only because of the way that subsidies work, which allows wind suppliers to bid into the market at a negative price (they are paying companies to take their electricity) and still make a profit. Those subsidies will likely be going away soon. Nuclear is cheap once you get it up and running, but it's very capital intensive upfront (at least traditional nuclear is) and it doesn't seem like the US is going to be adding more nuclear any time soon (fingers crossed that we will start adding more).   Even then you still have all of the other stuff that petroleum creates: plastics, chemicals, etc. Is the US auto market shifting away from ICE? Yes, slowly. But don't expect that our oil production is going anywhere soon, at least without significant government intervention, as I said.	longhorn617	t1_di7veat

There is nothing of substance, just the author letting us know how they feel.  I feel like a big problem is that a lot of people on the right do not seem to understand what anecdotal evidence is.

"Success" has felt unattainable by realistic standards to the extent that it seemed like it used to be. But one thing is for sure; my life has been contained to the post-9/11 world, and I know it has only hurt myself and the people around me. Wages have stagnated or decreased, housing prices ballooned, interest rates flatlined (good for short-term stimulus, but horrible for the long-term - imagine being able to achieve a consistent 7% return in a savings account instead of having to put it into the markets), and the war on terror has contributed to huge international insatability as well as deeper factioning of the population.	buyfreemoneynow	t1_di8574i

Therefore, using your tried and true method of applying judgement to an entire group based on one example, all alt-right followers are white supremacists.   Hey, I think I'm getting the hang of this! Let's do another one!  Greg Gianforte is the most recent GOP addition to congress. He believes it's perfectly okay to physically assault members of the press.

For example, A college campus can stop someone from speaking on their Campus and not violate free speech.  The person can go on a public street and start a monologue about their Nazi-kkk love triangle.    As for conservative thought - you mean like slavery?  Or Segregation?

t3_6e9g1r	t1_di8oak5	1496174415	Here's one for you - we bought a house a couple of years ago. This house is in a relatively wealthy neighborhood - had been on the market for two years, so we got a decent deal on it - on the low end of the average home sale price in the neighborhood at the time. Went to USAA for homeowners insurance.  They estimated the replacement value of our house at about 200K over what we paid - note, I mean what we paid for the house as it sits on over an acre of high valued land.  So, we asked for an insurance appraisal, because we figured that once a real person saw the house, they would agree it had been overestimated.  They sent someone out, the appraisal came back.  That appraisal was for almost 400K over what we paid for the house, on the property where it sits.  I guess they are figuring that the house and land will be swallowed in a sink hole?  I am not sure.   Oh, and, we are screwed to boot, because we were in the house for not two weeks when a pipe broke and flooded the basement.  USAA forced us to use a contractor from their contractor list.  We ended up finishing much of the work ourselves because this guy/company dragged their feet for over six months - we complained to USAA repeatedly, but they still paid him a ridiculous amount of money for the little work he did.   The reason we are screwed is because we can't go to any other insurance company now without paying through the nose due to that particular claim - even if they did value the house properly.

He knows this makes him look guilty, and by extension, Trump, and yet he still refuses to cooperate.  Even though he can largely claim attorney-client privilege to get out of most of the questions that will be asked of him.  When you know you can get out of almost any question, and you know that it looks really bad when you don't cooperate, and you still won't do it, you have got to be guilty of something.

What about the rights of the majority that is held hostage in this age of political correctness. In my opinion Obama wanted his political legacy to emulate Lyndon Johnson but instead of promoting the rights of African Americans he wanted to be the liberator of LGBT's. I voted for Clinton but I can understand why large numbers of the population felt marginalized and ignored by the Democrats.

t3_6ebu1q	t1_di95b1n	1496195429	&gt;At a White House press briefing, Daily Mail correspondent Francesca Chambers asked press secretary Sean Spicer to explain this inconsistency between Trump’s complaints about anonymous sourcing in news reports and his personal distribution of an anonymously sourced article.  &gt;**But rather than answering her question, Spicer ended up spouting non-sensical, unrelated material** and then moving on to another reporter:  ----  &gt;&gt;CHAMBERS: Thank you, Sean. **But the president retweeted, this morning, an article about that backchannel that was based on an anonymous source that said that there was an effort to set up a backchannel**, that it was the Russians who suggested that, and that it was to talk about Syria. Was the president not confirming that that effort — that there was an effort in the facts that I just said?  &gt;&gt;SPICER: I think what I just said speaks for itself.  &gt;&gt;CHAMBERS: But he was — but you said that, first of all, that the article was based on anonymous sources.  &gt;&gt;SPICER: Which it is.  &gt;&gt;CHAMBERS: **But the Fox article that the president retweeted was also based on anonymous sources. Why are those sources — or the source, rather — that they used more credible than the ones in the Washington Post article?**  &gt;&gt;SPICER: Again, I don’t think — there’s two issues at hand. **One is the statement that Jared’s attorney has provided.** The second is, is whether or not the backchannel — the dossier that was largely the basis for this was largely discredited in the first place. Most of the publications here refused to publish it in the first place. So, again, I’m not going to get into confirming stuff. There’s an ongoing investigation. John?  ----  Is Spicer suggesting that Kushner's attorney was the anonymous source? Because while the article suggests his answer was nonsensical, maybe it was a slip up? If I didn't know more, I might draw that conclusion.	The-Autarkh	t3_6ebu1q

You can't gaslight people into not knowing what crimes are.     Also Kushner lied on his security clearance about Russian contacts. That's a felony. You gonna try and claim he's not guilty of that felony? How do you explain that? That he did commit the felony but it was a good thing? The fuck is wrong with you?   Trump also admitted to obstruction of justice in public twice and two the Russians int he Oval Office.

Are you saying Kushner didn't lie on his security clearance?    That's a felony. Axiomatically. No law degree required.     You just again say "backchannels are a normal thing" pretending like you didn't see me respond "it's not a normal thing to hide them from your own government, especially not when you're not even in power in the government."    He committed a felony lying on his security clearance. The espionage is just the difference between him facing a few years in jail to facing decades in jail.    You didn't even pretend to respond to him lying on his security clearance form, because you're a propagandist defending Trump in any way that sounds reasonable rhetorically.    People reading this exchange can see what you're doing, and see how even you clearly can tell Kushner is fucked so you don't respond to the thing you can't even think of a defense of, you just try to muddy the waters of what a backchannel is and what espionage is.

t3_6e9y9o	t1_di99wxz	1496201910	The suicide rate is high because of the discrimination that trans people face from society. And the suicide rate goes DOWN if trans people are allowed to transition and have support.  Here are some studies to back that up:  * [Murad, et al., 2010](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19473181): "significant decrease in suicidality post-treatment. The average reduction was from 30 percent pretreatment to 8 percent post treatment. ... A meta-analysis of 28 studies showed that 78 percent of transgender people had improved psychological functioning after treatment."  * [UK study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf): "Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition. 7% found that this increased during transition, which has implications for the support provided to those undergoing these processes (N=316)."  * [De Cuypere, et al., 2006](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1158136006000491?via=sd&amp;cc=y): Rate of suicide attempts dropped dramatically from 29.3 percent to 5.1 percent after receiving medical and surgical treatment among Dutch patients treated from 1986-2001.  * [Dr. Ryan Gorton](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3219066): “In a cross-sectional study of 141 transgender patients, Kuiper and Cohen-Kittenis found that after medical intervention and treatments, suicide fell from 19 percent to zero percent in transgender men and from 24 percent to 6 percent in transgender women.)”  * [Lawrence, 2003](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024086814364) surveyed post-op trans folk: "Participants reported overwhelmingly that they were happy with their SRS results and that SRS had greatly improved the quality of their lives. None reported outright regret and only a few expressed even occasional regret."  * [Smith Y, 2005](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15842032): Participants improved on 13 out of 14 mental health measures after receiving treatments.	drewiepoodle	t1_di99gz3

t3_6ecskv	t1_di9dydh	1496209231	Trying to see where Putin's influence begins and domestic "perfect storm" conditions end is a challenge. Putin could not possibly have *produced* Donald Trump, but my suspicion is that when Putin saw Donald Trump as a potential candidate, perhaps as far back as during the "Birther" Movement, he began placing his bets - exerting subtle influence. The secret communications channel, I am sure, was a Russian trap.   I think the article was a bit alarmist in it's proposed coup to end the Trump Administration, I have a bit more faith in checks and balances, but as Timothy Snyder discusses with Sam Harris, faith in checks and balances can be very ill-placed:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmI_YNGx_jE  That being said, a lot of our worst fears about Trump seem to be coming true. Most likely you will see Russia attempt to supplant the US economically in Europe and therefore win the Cold War without firing a shot. To put a really blunt bow on it, Trump is really fucking us hard.	rAxxt	t1_di9dhcc
t3_6ecskv	t1_di9e631	1496209700	Its not exactly a Stealth World War if everyone knows it exists.  The simple fact that news outlets report on this stuff *at all* is kind of important.    Putin's Russia has introduced a modern form of warfare, no doubt, but its one that relies on complacency and apathy more than extremist views.  I would conclude that this has only galvanized support for journalism and political activism.  Trump's removal from office (legally) would be regarded is history as one of the greatest success stories of modern democracy.	wakka-wakka-wakka	t3_6ecskv

Such a dramatic and positive upswing would, I think, be as cathartic as you propose - and rightfully so. In war, however, we plan for the worst and hope for the best. If his removal does not come to fruition, and even if we have a course correction in 2020, I'm not so sure that we will be free of the insidious hold that is now upon our democracy.

[Full Bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/10/text?format=txt)	ILikeLenexa	t3_6ef3hv
t3_6ef1ej	t1_di9rmqw	1496239285	I don't speak Trump. What does covfefe mean? What do people think it means? Was it a misspelling of something? Was he trying to spell coffee?	lsp2005	t3_6ef1ej
t3_6ef1ej	t1_di9rrti	1496239460	&gt;but what we're not seeing is this is one of the tweets that will be used in the inevitable Trump criminal trial to build his defense that he was not mentally competent.   Um...  the evidence is mounting that he may honestly NOT be mentally competent.  In which case blaming his enablers and\or exploiters would be entirely appropriate.    Besides, even if this is (somehow) some gigantic ruse to try to build a defense, what of it?  If he seriously has to pretend to be demented to dodge criminal charges, then he will have still shredded his brand and turned himself into a pathetic joke.  When a man is willing to sink THAT low just to avoid responsibility for his own actions, there's probably nothing worse that can be done to him than to force him to live with his own cowardice.	APeacefulWarrior	t1_di9r2ms
t3_6ef2t5	t1_di9rxba	1496239645	From another Josh musing on the subject: "The most plausible ‘bad’ story behind the Trump/Russia mystery has always been some kind of financial preferment to members of the Trump family in exchange for lifting the sanctions put in place after the Russian annexation of Crimea and subsequent low-intensity incursions into eastern Ukraine. This wouldn’t come out of the blue. It would probably come in the context of some ‘deal’ over Syria or Ukraine or perhaps some agreement about global counter-terrorism cooperation. As I’ve written, there is a more ‘innocent‘ explanation as well. It may not be any quid pro quo. It could simply be years of doing business with Russians and people from other parts of the former Soviet Union which has made Trump inclined to see their needs in a sympathetic light. His hostility toward the sanctions regime could also be driven by the fact that, with his dependence on Russian and FSU investments and purchases, they likely hurt him directly."	Walkitback	t3_6ef2t5
t3_6ef1ej	t1_di9s1sx	1496239801	Maybe his auto correct screwed him over or something.  Or maybe, as I remember another user suggesting, they really did take his phone away while he was in the middle of tweeting.	AthiestLoki	t3_6ef1ej

t3_6ef2t5	t1_di9sbxd	1496240146	Yet, if you watch Fox News you'd think the whole Kusher "back channel" incident is benign, nothing to see here.  They spin it as if he went through the proper channels to setup this communication between Russia and the Trump administration.  The only problem is that's complete bullshit, when in reality he tried to *circumvent* the US Intel community by setting up his own communications directly with the Russians.  Totally different story all together!	blunted1	t3_6ef2t5
t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9sdc2	1496240193	No, I get it, I just don't necessarily think that it's the governments job to stop people from cannibalizing themselves.  A strong economy and a more informed base that doesnt feel the need to get payday loans not only helps prevent this but still allows people to have their freedoms. This is the same as going after drug users rather than trying to figure out what is causing people to use drugs.	jpovey151	t1_di9s8ta
t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9sdmq	1496240203	Yes, financial desperation is such fun and making your choices from that standpoint is always good for a laugh.	coldbloodednuts	t3_6ef3hv

t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9sj5m	1496240392	It's not about limiting choice.  It's about limiting the fraud in the Payday loan industry.  When [a huge company can make $2 Billion based mostly on fraud](http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/article59551056.html), some rules are necessary.  This prosecution should not be stopped.

t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9sxj6	1496240867	Actual text of the bill disagrees, read it.  &gt;Federal authorities may not exercise **any rulemaking, enforcement or other authority with respect to payday loans**, vehicle title loans or other similar loans.	ILikeLenexa	t1_di9supb
t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9szt1	1496240942	Er, no. There's a reason why usury has been illegal in societies going back thousands of years. It's not a "freedom". These people often have no idea what they're getting themselves into and once the fix sets in, they end up in a worse financial hole than when they started, which leads to drugs (hey, there's a "cause" that you were looking for!) and crime, which is a cost to society. **Absolutely** the government should be actively involved in this.	secondtolastjedi	t1_di9sdc2

t3_6ef1ej	t1_di9tbkk	1496241325	Trump made a really awful typo on his cell phone, and then he tried to play it off as a joke (likely at the behest of somebody else).  I don't think we should even be talking about this. Sure, if there wasn't an ongoing investigation into Russia ties, an exit from the Paris Climate Agreement, a healthcare plan axing coverage for 23 million, and some rather incendiary actions taken by his Secretary of Education, this would be a fun thing to discuss.  But all those things are happening.	daveeb	t3_6ef1ej

t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9tsut	1496241878	No, it should be the government's job to save people from themselves. Especially in cases where there is a great detriment to society or not stepping in will cost a lot of taxpayer dollars. Obviously not in all cases, but in something like this where it can screw up a person's credit score or aid them in going bankrupt there should be the ability to intervene.	zorrofuerte	t1_di9sdc2

t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9u3l5	1496242220	If we had a reasonable safety net for people that get into trouble, then I'd agree that we could live in a world where payday lenders can do whatever they want.  But we don't have a strong enough safety net for that yet.	noahcallaway-wa	t1_di9ttjr

t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9u5b3	1496242275	And what about if a person uses it responsibly and you are screwing them out of that option? Again, it's better to put people in a position where they don't feel the need to use payday loans. You're fighting a symptom and limiting liberties and not really doing anything effectual other than limiting one symptom.	jpovey151	t1_di9tsut

t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9u9t3	1496242417	So how about we spend our time building a safety net rather than wasting it worrying about restricting liberty?	jpovey151	t1_di9u3l5
t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9uds2	1496242545	I'll have this conversation with you.  1) That's not what "whataboutism" is.  2) No, I don't love payday loans, anyone that gets them is stupid. Anyone that smokes cigarettes is stupid but it's their body and their choice.  3) Payday loans are NOT a good thing, liberty is.  4) I'm pro marijuana legalization, just the same as I don't think government should be limiting payday loans I don't think they have any business sticking their faces in drug laws, of any sort, unless those laws are for purity and cleanliness.	jpovey151	t1_di9u2ob

t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9ugb2	1496242626	One of those things limits personal liberty and is the equivalent of putting a bandaid on a wound that needs surgery and the other actually has a chance of fixing the problem.	jpovey151	t1_di9tlsf
t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9uq1g	1496242931	I won't deny that society isn't fair, I'm overwhelmingly pro socialism because I understand that predatory practices have created a ridiculous imbalance and as a result some/many/most(?) people don't really have a fair shake and we need to protect people from that.  But payday loans has nothing to do with earning an income or a liveable wage. Other than that people who aren't earning the wage they need are more likely to use payday loans. This isn't the fault of the payday loan, this is the fault of a failing economy and class imbalance.  So, no I'm not OK with companies being predatory to the part where it creates such a class imbalance that people feel the need to use payday loans, but I AM OK with companies being predatory once the playing field is level and you are just restricting liberty rather than fixing the ACTUAL problem. At some point people need to be held responsible for their actions and that INCLUDES allowing them to make their own choices, good or bad.	jpovey151	t1_di9ug4d
t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9urql	1496242983	I'm not saying it's campaign contributions, but it's campaign contributions.  &gt;the payday lending industry donated about $15 million to various political causes. The top individual recipient of the payday lending industry money was, yes, Representative Hensarling with $210,500.	ILikeLenexa	t1_di9u584
t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9usyw	1496243022	Because the people in power now are currently working to dismantle the safety net.  We need to spend our energy trying to stop them from dismantling the safety net, but we don't have the power at the moment to build that safety net.  Additionally, the party in power is making it easier for people to _fall_. While we resist them dismantling the safety net, we also need to push to make it harder for people to fall and _need_ the safety net.  My long term goals _are_ around building the safety net. My short term goals are around resisting efforts to dismantle that safety net and resisting efforts to make it easier for people to need that safety net.  If you have any ideas on a better use of our time to build that safety net, I'm all ears.	noahcallaway-wa	t1_di9u9t3
t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9utxx	1496243053	That's just painfully myopic. A safety net needs to be paired with a commensurate legal system that does everything it can to steer people away from saturating it's usage, or else it would just collapse under it's own expense.	secondtolastjedi	t1_di9u9t3
t3_6edzd2	t1_di9uva1	1496243098	Too bad there's no chance of him working hard to better himself so he doesn't deserve it so much.	morpheousmarty	t1_di9k3hd

t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9v4p6	1496243393	1. That is never going to happen. There will always be people that feel they need to use payday loans. If you have some great educational idea for this then start marketing it since you will be a multi-millionaire.  2. You need to fight the symptom because you will never be able to cure the underlying cause. If you get enough people some of them are going to act in irrational and self-destructive ways. You will never get that to stop.  There are plenty of things that are illegal that someone would use responsibly but have to be illegal because of the overall impact to social utility. Yes it would be good for people to have options for very short term loans. The point is outlawing the parts that are predatory in nature. The people that take on these loans are typically in need and have little financial literacy. They are the group most likely to be duped into terms they don't fully understand. Someone will come up with another option that since there is so much money to be made with it if you outlaw payday loans or the more predatory parts. Don't think just because specific parameters are outlawed that someone won't find a solution.	zorrofuerte	t1_di9u5b3
t3_6ef1ej	t1_di9v5f7	1496243415	Well done. If somehow you'd been a year old account, I'd have followed you to the ends of the earth.	LadiesLoveCoolComey	t1_di9qwmo
t3_6ef1ej	t1_di9v8mf	1496243513	Mayyybe, but it can be argued it was a typo.   Not to mention that if Trump is mentally incompetent, OK - Ivanka, Jared, Don Jr. and Eric will likely all go to jail and the RICO case will take the entire Trump empire, down to the last cent.   If we can't jail Trump, ending his entire legacy is a nice consolation prize.	LadiesLoveCoolComey	t1_di9r2ms
t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9v8yl	1496243525	1) I don't care. You should be free to make bad choices in so far as the field is level.  2) How has fighting the symptoms helped with drugs? Oh wait, it hasn't.  You and I disagree, that's ok. I just don't think we should limit liberty unnecessarily when it's not at all the problem but rather the symptom.	jpovey151	t1_di9v4p6

t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9vmus	1496243955	In respect to drugs? If you sell marijuana it has to be marijuana and not laced with something else, so on and so forth.

t3_6ef1ej	t1_di9vvrx	1496244230	The attention to 'Covfefe' perfectly epitomizes the difference between the Trump and Obama administrations.  Where is the self-deprecation in Trump's administration, the ability to laugh at one's self?  Sure, the WH tried to cover it up with a second, much later tweet, but that just reinforces the point.  We know that wasn't Trump (it's probably Kellyanne).   Trump has never said a self-deprecating word his entire life.	coffeespeaking	t3_6ef1ej

t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9wa2s	1496244674	Why shouldn't we do both? In an ideal world payday loans would exist and would only be used by people in a short term cash crunch. They would get the loan, get their paycheck and pay it off.  But we have data that shows that is not what happens now. Now a majority of lenders end up having to get a second loan to pay off the first loan. They end up paying many times the principle by the time they have paid it off (if they manage that).   So until we can fix the underlying issues, we limit the current damage. If we end up fixing the underlying issues, we revisit the regulations.	kanst	t1_di9v8yl
t3_6ef3hv	t1_di9wad1	1496244682	yes.  If you are going to suggest that somehow means we should regulate against payday loans though I disagree.  In the same way that you should have to specify what's in your drugs but legally allow people to make the choice to consume drugs you should have to specify what's involved with the loans (to prevent fraud) but still allow people the option to take them.	jpovey151	t1_di9vsfd

The fact of the matter is that going a little out of your way to get around fantasy lake is going to be a hell of a lot cheaper and faster than waiting for someone to build you a bridge just so you don't have to "spend time driving north."

t3_6ef1ej	t1_di9xsxd	1496246340	It's a cool evening in October. You hear the sound of leaves rustling gently in the wind. You see an older person walk over to a headstone, lay down a flower, and says a few words, only to walk away.   Your curiosity gets the better of you, and you walk through the grass slowly, checking to see if anyone is watching. You get to the gravestone and see a god ray of light across the body of the tombstone, reading "COVFEFE". You're shocked to find it like this, not knowing what it means nor why it is here.   You start to feel nervous, and start walking briskly away. The word burned into your mind repeating itself rapidly. All you want is to get away, you start moving faster. You start hearing it louder and louder the more you get away from it, running now to try to get away from Covfefe. Sprinting now, you feel a grab at your ankle and you fall to the ground.   You roll over on your back as you notice a shadow hovering over you. It's the old person from earlier with a shovel raised above their head. She shouts to the sky "COVFEEEEEEEFEEEEEEEEE" and shoves it down and against your throat.   Covfefe, what a strange word, and the last word you ever heard.	SGTSHOOTnMISS	t1_di9x85y

t3_6efy2f	t1_di9zwgx	1496248631	The problem is 99% of the time, the people getting punched aren't Nazis. I'm pretty sure the only actual Nazi that got punched was Richard Spencer. The rest were almost all innocent bystanders. It's really sad to see.  http://abc7news.com/news/video-trump-supporter-pepper-sprayed-at-milo-protest/1733004/  This girl is no Nazi but people saw a red hat on her head and went completely bonkers. It's not even a MAGA hat. It says "Make Bitcoin Great Again".  This is the real danger when we decide it's ok to punch people if they're Nazis and a large segment of the population also believes that anyone to the right of them is a Nazi.  So in theory I'd agree with you that punching a Nazi is something I'd be happy with. It's just that it's very very rarely that it's actually a Nazi getting punched.	AlternativeMulligans	t1_di9znbp

How things should be measured is when the become official policy, as in removing white supremacy from investigation or leaders pushing for active attacks.  Also, Milo supported pedophilia, so now Republicans have rallied around Nazism and pedophilia when making up excuses or discussing things.

Just that removing payday loans isn't really helping anything, it's just wasting time. If you take payday loan places out of the ghetto then you still have a ghetto. Get rid of the ghetto and you don't have any payday loan places.  Same goes with drugs, make drugs illegal and you have cartels and violence and gangs and laced drugs.

t3_6ef3hv	t1_dia3dqi	1496252384	This is a very interesting point, but I think the government's most important function is protecting its people. These unregulated payday loan companies not only charge outrageous interest, but they also sell your information to hundreds of other predatory companies who continuously harass consumers. I understand that these consumers agreed to the interest charges, but many of these companies capitalize on things that are hidden in the agreements that are signed.  I wouldn't say this is the same as going after drug users, it's more like going after drug dealers who are lacing their product with harmful additives. If they are left unregulated they can put whatever poison they want into their product to keep the consumer stuck. If the product is regulated it is less harmful to the consumer and held to a standard that is better for everyone. Less personal debt is better for the economy. Keeping these places unchecked purely for the reason of teaching the people a lesson isn't good for anyone. They can still have these loans available while making sure they are not screwing people over. Just like food is still available while being held to a standard that assures people's safety via regulation.	omnomnymous1	t1_di9sdc2

t3_6ef3hv	t1_dia42hc	1496253116	Not understanding the language in contracts is completely commonplace. I deal with contracts all the time and people from all backgrounds get confused by them. A lot of the language and the practical applications of them is not very accessible to a lay person. It isn't really that people are too ignorant or lazy. It is just the nature of it that unless your job demands you to familiarize yourself with contracts that it isn't practical to read every single word of enough contracts that you fully understand them.	zorrofuerte	t1_dia2psb

The liberals have come crying out of their "safe place" and gone mad with pouting and crying. Really pathetic. I know. You know it. They even know it. But they're entitled little babies who care about only their agenda. That's why you can count on Trump for 8 years and his son to become President soon after him.

t3_6ef3hv	t1_dia4j3y	1496253605	1. You have to know what to ask and how to ask it. That in itself requires a decent understanding of contracts.  2. They could tell the truth, but not tell the whole truth. That is deceitful as well. Also, you would have to show that they specifically said what they said. That would not happen if you are asking the person face to face.  3. If there was impropriety, then you would have to know what to do and have the resources to seek compensation for the damages. Which these people probably do not. So there isn't that as a deterrent.	zorrofuerte	t1_dia43qn

t3_6eg7il	t1_dia4na0	1496253729	Though I already commented about the stripping of the [Johnson Ammendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson amendment) I just want to add an anecdote about a similar situation, though I'm not from the state in question.   In 7th grade, a girl in my grade sent nudes to one boy who, in turn then sent them around. Well, being like 13, a lot of our parents monitored our phones, so of course they got found very quickly and reported to the police. The guy(s) got in no trouble, yet the girl had to through diversion program, pay fines, be publicly shamed, and had to take classes and stuff.   It just seemed so disproportionate at the time, and now they go and do stuff like this? Idk, I understand the times are different than when they were kids, but I don't think that you can legislate your way out of teenage curiosity.	infamous_moses	t3_6eg7il
t3_6ef3hv	t1_dia4s42	1496253877	No, it is that you have the opportunity to make things better in some way. It may not be ideal, but it is an improvement.

They did not threaten people, they had an issue with the professor who voiced his (thoughtful and correct) opinion. Again, it's interesting how sensitive white people are to racial discrimination.	d48reu	t1_dia4uar
t3_6ef3hv	t1_dia531m	1496254207	1) If you are incapable of asking "how much am I going to have to pay back and when" when you borrow money then that individual faces greater problems than borrowing money. That person needs to be educated, as I said.  2/3) have nothing to do with payday loans and if you want to stop that then you need to pass legislation to prevent THAT.  It's clear that we disagree on one thing and that is that I think it's the acts that should be illegal, not the allowances that could possibly lead to the acts. If you continue down this road of rational then we should consider making bleach illegal, it doesnt really serve that much of a purpose but there's nothing to stop you from drinking it and killing yourself.

t3_6eg7il	t1_dia53s6	1496254229	We separate church from state, not state from church.  I have no issue with a religion endorsing/supporting a particular candidate.

I have a **huge** issue with an elected politician citing any religion in support or rejection of any regulation.	MyNameIsRay	t1_dia3r39
t3_6ef3hv	t1_dia552q	1496254266	"Not stopping payday loans" and "choosing not to do something" are not the same thing. You could in fact choose to stop the problem in the first place, which again, isnt' the payday loans.  And stopping payday loans doesnt actually DO ANYTHING to make their life better. All this does is remove the option for them to make their lives "worse" or worse yet it removes the option for people that would use this responsibly from having the freedom and liberty to do so.	jpovey151	t1_dia4s42

t3_6egutd	t1_dia5pfo	1496254870	From the article: &gt; Ask Americans about their personal views on moral issues, and they are more likely than ever to hold a liberal position. Ask them about the country’s moral values, and they’re becoming more and more pessimistic. &gt;  &gt; The church today finds itself in a precarious position, as an ethical shift pushes public opinion in favor of stances that Christians have traditionally sided against. Meanwhile, Americans from all political and theological stripes have their own reasons to be concerned over moral decline. &gt;  &gt; In a recent poll, Gallup found a widening embrace for more than a dozen moral issues, including record-high acceptance for gay relationships, divorce, pornography, polygamy, and physician-assisted suicide. &gt;  &gt; Of the 19 issues queried about, Americans have become more liberal on 13 of them (with 10 hitting record highs) and stayed consistent on 6—most notably abortion, which 43 percent of Americans and 34 percent of Protestants deem morally acceptable. &gt;  &gt; Americans have not shifted more conservative on any of the 19 moral issues measured.

t3_6egutd	t1_dia6jwe	1496255766	OK, Americans as a whole are more liberal in their social values... More Americans are concerned about values across the political spectrum, I can see that viewpoint...  Perhaps the concept the author cannot fathom is that the "Christian right" or political conservatives don't hold the monopoly on what constitutes "moral values". Perfect examples include being decent to people who are in some way different or not bearing false witness against what the core principles of science or other philosophies are.  I've been concerned about the morals and values of people who use religion as an excuse for hate for years.	GuitarCD	t3_6egutd

t3_6eh10y	t1_dia7opn	1496256942	The issue goes much deeper than that.  **1. Median wealth per adult**  **Rank of U.S.**: 27th out of 27 high-income countries  Americans may feel like global leaders, but Spain, Cyprus and Qatar all have [higher median wealth (per capita)](http://www.middleclasspoliticaleconomist.com/2013/10/median-wealth-increases-but-us-still.html?m=1) than America’s (about [$39,000]). So does much of Europe and the industrialized world. Per capita median income in the US ($18,700) is also relatively low--and unchanged since 2000. A middle-class [Canadian’s income is now higher.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/the-american-middle-class-is-no-longer-the-worlds-richest.html?abt=0002&amp;amp;abg=1)  **2. Education and skills**  **Rank of U.S.**: 16th out of 23 countries  The US ranked near the bottom in a skills survey by the [Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development](http://skills.oecd.org/skillsoutlook.html), which examined European and other developed nations. In its Skills Outlook 2013, the US placed 16th in adult literacy, [21st in adult numeracy](http://www.ncee.org/cieb/piaac-skills-outlook-2013-from-oecd/) out of 23, and [14th in problem-solving](http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264204904-en). Spots in prestigious US universities are highly sought-after. Yet higher education, once an effective way out of poverty in the US, [isn’t anymore](https://cew.georgetown.edu/report/stem/) – at least not for lower-income and minority students. 80% of white college students attend Barron’s Top 500 schools, while 75% of black and Latino students go to two-year junior colleges or open-admissions (not Top 500) schools. Poor students are also far less likely to complete a degree.  **3. Internet speed and access**  **Rank of U.S.**: 16th out of 34 countries  Broadband access has become essential for industry to grow and flourish. Yet in the US, penetration is low and [speed relatively slow](http://www.oecd.org/sti/broadband/BB-Portal-5a.xls) versus wealthy nations—thought the [cost of internet is among the highest](http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888932799836) ($0.04 per megabit per second in Japan, for example, versus $0.53 in the US). The problem may be [too much concentration](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/business/economy/concentrated-markets-take-big-toll-on-economy.html) and too little competition in the industry.  **4. Health**  **Rank of U.S.**: 33rd out of 145 countries  When it comes to its citizens’ health, in countries that are home to at least one million people, the US ranks [below many other wealthy countries](http://images.businessweek.com/bloomberg/pdfs/WORLDS_HEALTHIEST_COUNTRIES.pdf). More American [women also are dying](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2960696-6/fulltext) during pregnancy and childbirth. For every 100,000 births in the United States, 18.5 women die. Saudi Arabia and Canada have half that maternal death rate.  **5. People living below the poverty line**  **Rank of U.S.**: 36th out of 162 countries, behind Morocco and Albania  Officially, 14.5% of Americans are impoverished -- 45.3 million people--according to the latest [US Census](http://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2014/cb14-169.html) data. [That’s a larger fraction](http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?v=69) of the population in poverty than Morocco and Albania ([though how nations define poverty varies considerably](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/)). The elderly have Social Security, with its automatic cost-of-living adjustments to thank for doing better: Few seniors (one in 10) are poor today versus 50 years ago (when it was one in three). Poverty is also [down among African Americans](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/13/whos-poor-in-america-50-years-into-the-war-on-poverty-a-data-portrait/). Now America’s poor are more often in their prime working years, or in households headed by single mothers.  **6. Children in poverty**  **Rank of U.S.**: 34th out of 35 countries surveyed  When UNICEF relative poverty – relative to the average in each society—[the US ranked at the bottom](http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/655), above only Romania, even as Americans are, on average, six times richer than Romanians. Children in all of Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan [fare better](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/04/15/map-how-35-countries-compare-on-child-poverty-the-u-s-is-ranked-34th/).  **7. Income inequality**  **Rank of U.S.**: Fourth highest inequality in the world.  The most [severe inequality](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI/) can be found in [Chile, Mexico, Turkey -- and the US](http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/income-inequality/). This inequality [slows economic growth](http://www.oecd.org/social/inequality.htm), impedes youths’ opportunities, and ultimately threatens the nation’s future (an [OECD video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyprxOa1H1s) explains). Worsening income inequality is also evident in the ratio of average [CEO earnings to average workers’](http://www.heritageinstitute.com/governance/compensation.htm) pay. That ratio went from 24:1 in 1965 to 262:1 in 2005.  **8. Prison population**  **Rank of U.S.**: First out of 224 countries  More than 2.2 million Americans are in jail. [Only China comes close](http://www.prisonstudies.org/highest-to-lowest/prison-population-total?field_region_taxonomy_tid=All), with about 1.66 million.  **9. Life satisfaction**  **Rank of U.S.**: 17th out of 36 countries  Americans’ [happiness score is only middling](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/life-satisfaction/), according to the OECD Better Life Index. (The index measures how people evaluate their life as a whole rather than their current feelings.) People in New Zealand, Finland, and Israel rate higher in life satisfaction. A [UN report](http://unsdsn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WorldHappinessReport2013_online.pdf) had a similar finding.  **10. Corruption**  **Rank of U.S.**: 17th out of 175 countries.  Barbados and Luxembourg are ahead of the US when it comes to citizens’ perceptions of corruption. Americans view their country as "somewhat corrupt," according to [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results), a Berlin-based nonprofit. In a separate survey of American citizens, many said [politicians don’t serve the majority’s interest](http://www.princeton.edu/~mgilens/Gilens%20homepage%20materials/Gilens%20and%20Page/Gilens%20and%20Page%202014-Testing%20Theories%203-7-14.pdf), but are biased toward corporate lobbyists and the super-rich. Special interest groups are gradually transforming the United States into an oligarchy concerned only about the needs of the wealthy.  **11. Stability**  **Rank of U.S.**: 20th out of 178 countries.  The Fragile States Index considers factors such as inequality, corruption, and factionalism. The [US lags behind Portugal](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/fragile-states-2014), Slovenia and Iceland.  **12. Social progress index**  **Rank of U.S.**: 16th out of 133 countries  A broad measure of social well-being, the index comprises 52 economic indicators such as access to clean water and air, access to advanced education, access to basic knowledge, and safety. [Countries surpassing the US](http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/data/spi#data_table/countries/spi/dim1,dim2,dim3) include Ireland, the UK, Iceland, and Canada.  Overall, America’s per capita wealth, health and education measures are mediocre for a highly industrialized nation. Well-being metrics, perceptions of corruption, quality and cost of basic services, are sliding, too. Healthcare and education spending are funding bloated administrations even while human outcomes sink.

I am cheering for the opposite team, but I must agree completely with her assessment of *how* America is a morally plural society, and that the problem is that we have two completely separate moral foundations that are incompatible.  I hope that her moral foundation flounders and collapses and everyone eventually comes to accept that mine is not only superior, but that hers was fundamentally broken to begin with.  She hopes for the same, in reverse.  But we agree about the nature of the problem itself, and that is something I have to respect.	Diabolico	t3_6egutd

My spouse and I have similar backgrounds and regularly discuss the years of our lives that we lost to superstition (including lost connections and relationships because of prudish/ignorant/judgmental views, one entire day every week that we set aside for our imaginary friend, and 10% of our pre-tax income that we donated to his tax-free organization).

t3_6eh33y	t1_dia87iq	1496257486	&gt; “Many of these affluent-area projects would have been built and jobs created without the infusion of EB-5 capital,” said Gary Friedland, a scholar in residence at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “Consequently, deserving projects can’t be built and the resulting jobs are lost because the projects are deprived of the essential capital to proceed.” The government caps the number of EB-5 visas it issues each year, and most of the resulting investment goes to high-profile projects in prosperous areas.  Using finite resources meant to encourage development in economically depressed areas in order to help the rich get richer through the cheap financing of luxury buildings in affluent areas...sounds about as american as is gets.	dy0nisus	t3_6eh33y
t3_6egznc	t1_dia8a7a	1496257565	In my experience, they're people who are fond of quick answers, and hate "the Establishment" so anyone who comes along with a big simple message gets their attention, and while they went with Sanders because they're nominally socially liberal, they genuinely believe the last 20 years of Conservative-Media slander about Hillary, so they easily fell for the "Hillary is a murderer who fixed the primaries" narrative that agents-provocateurs were pushing, and flipped to Trump, who is similar to Sanders in that he a) is an "outsider" to the two-party system and b) his message is simple fixes for big issues.	postmodest	t1_dia7xh1

Or that Russia is ranked just one behind at 37.  Heck, in Qatar, female circumcision is legal. Children over the age of seven are considered criminally responsible. Child labor involving children of foreign nationals, which makes up 88% of the country's population, is a real concern.	Trombosaurus	t3_6eh10y

The whole argument that "well, he was a Sanders supporter too"—implying Sanders' is somehow to blame for his behavior—reflects on Bernie Sanders is clearly ridiculous and nothing more than partisan propaganda.

I moved out of the U.S. in my twenties and where I live now I often read in the paper situations where individuals or companies are found guilty of breaking the 'spirit' of a particular law. This makes sense to me in that I would assume it is impossible to define a law or set of rules to where there would be zero loop holes. And as we know, people will always find the loopholes if it benefits them. And as far as who defines what the 'spirit' is that can easily enough be left up to non-partisan experts. Assuming the rules or law is recent you could even ask the people that wrote them if there is question of intention.	T0SSTHATSH1T	t3_6eh33y

t3_6ef3hv	t1_dia98m5	1496258548	I think it's important to note that what Republicans are trying to pass is not a skepticism of regulations, but a complete ban of any rules or enforcement against them.    Second, it's important to point out that Democrats aren't advocating for an elimination of the market as a whole.  First, Warren specifically has advocated that small dollar loans like this [be handled by the Post Office](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/11/post-office-banking_n_6656614.html) as well as small transactions like paycheck cashing.    &gt;if you calculate the annual percentage rate on that car rental — meaning that if you divide the amount you pay on that car by the value of that automobile — you get similarly high rates  Do you?  So, I can rent a Buick Verano for $237.29/wk through enterprise (taxes, fees and everything).  So, if I rented it for 52 weeks, that's $12,339.08.  The Buick Verano starts at $21,065.  So, converting $12,339.08 to an APR, that's ~59%.    In contrast, a rate of 400% is nearly 7 times more.   The APR calculated that way on a car is **85% less** than on a payday loan.

t3_6egznc	t1_dia9d84	1496258680	&gt; He is walking confirmation of my suspicion that those people only ever cared to have a not-female president.  This is narrow-minded opinion. there are many reasons why these people went from sanders to trump. Hindsight is great that we can tell how bad trump is now but you gotta think like a 2016 voter.  They had no idea trump would be as bad as he is now. Russian propaganda pushed a narrative that the current admin is as bad as trump would ever be. There are many criticism of Obama on foreign policy and many felt HRC was a vote for perpetual war.   DJT gave the impression he was the anti-war vote. he gave the impression that he was anti-corporate power in politics. Was he lying? yes especially in hindsight. But to voters who weren't watching everyday and had serious concerns about the Obama admin may vote for trump. Not necessarily because they like him but because they disliked both and trump wasn't selling a disaster at that point.  Now that trump is a disaster, its easy to point back and say clearly anyone who voted for him is stupid but you got to remember that he sold a different view than he is enacting.

t3_6egutd	t1_dia9ot8	1496259012	What a strange article.  The author is willing to raise the idea or concept of moral pluralism and yet manages to create an entire article from a single viewpoint.  They really should done a bit more of looking for someone representing the "other side" rather than just taking polls to see how many people don't share their concerns.  For a lot of things, in the US at the moment at least, the issue isn't wildly different systems of morality.  It's rather inescapble to recognize the Judeo-Christian background to a lot of the patterns in US thought and practice.  The thing is, however, what parts of that are various groups emphasizing.  For example, though this is not comprehensive, let me describe two groups:  * The first is really, really concerned about treating Homosexuality as a sin. * The second is really, really concerned about treating Lying and Deceit as a sin.  It's entirely possible the emphasis of either group can be so strong they ignore the other part.  And, though this is somewhat trivial, the second group ranks "higher" with regards to precedence in the Decalogue (unless you're willing to equate Adultery with Homosexuality).  I don't think Chrstianity Today appreciates that what a lot of people hold against Christians, Conservatives, etc., is that they've become synonomous with Lying in the eyes of the "other side".  This isn't just because of people like Trump.  It's because on so many issues, Christians have abandoned any sort of evidence-based epistemology... you know... Reason based on observable Truth.  Because their arguments fall apart on rigorous analysis, they fall back to an Authoritarian-based epistemology (believe it because I said so... do I need to say it again LOUDER?).

Now the representation of Republicans is a person double fisting shivs and repeatedly stabbing the other person in the face while screaming about how that person is useless because they are full of stab wounds. Then trump comes along and pisses on both of them"  Updating it to 2 guys walking to a table in a restaurant (and stealing your "See?")   the left guy walks to the table with an actual interest in governing and improving peoples lives and holds his hand out to shake  and the guy on the right spends his whole trip to the table saying how the meeting will be awful, they'll never agree on anything, their government can never ever work and then stabs him in the hand    Then he hands the knives to a black waiter walking by and says "See?"

t3_6eh10y	t1_diaawp7	1496260266	Ok, so I'm a Canadian who grew up in Qatar (the child of two teachers at a Canadian college), I feel I can shed light on this as you guys are all assuming that the slavery in Qatar includes child labor. The slavery issue in Qatar is not near as simple as most would have you believe. Firstly, it's almost all indentured servitude (usually SE Asians males working manual labor on construction projects or the like, or women working at restaurants or as maids). The employees are enticed by the high wages (compared to what they make at home where prospects are far worse) and come to Qatar alone to send money back to their families. They come on 2-3 year contacts, and in many cases have their passport confiscated once they arrive (though usually they don't need them, as they require an "exit visa" from their sponsor to leave - I've actually ran into this issue myself). They are there for that time, make their money and go home. Sometimes there are issues with payment as some companies don't pay for extended periods (hell, the Canadian college my parents worked for did this to my dad once his contract was up. They owed him 100,000 benefit for working there, but never coughed it up.) It's a very troubled country at times but it isn't as black and white as many would have you think. The queen-mother to the current Emir just built a museum to slavery in Qatar and is trying to fight it from within.  I rarely see SE Asian families in the country, those that are present are almost always related to people in management positions. So this study would likely not relate to them- depending on who it's referring to the Qataris alone, or including the expat children, there will be some noteworthy differences. Qatari families are almost all very wealthy, and they children get both the pros and cons that come with that (a fair few of them are raised by maids with no imput from their parents). The public schools aren't amazing, but usually are reserved for other Arab expats and mid-status Qataris. Many Qataris are sent to the prestigious private schools in the area. Children of expats are definitely residents, but not citizens.   I have a lot more I want to say, and I'd wish I could refine this more but I need to go for now.	Bucksavvy	t1_dia7l6f

GOP leaders plan to use the same process for tax cuts as well.   Probably worthwhile to point out that it's almost impossible for the Senate to be able to use reconciliation for *both* AHCA *and* tax cuts, since, if reconciliation is used for both spending and revenues, you can't use it in the same year without another budget resolution (which is what the GOP's trying to avoid).  On the broader point, Trump gets facts wrong because he doesn't care, and he doesn't *have* to care, because his supporters don't care, and the GOP doesn't care, because they know he'll sign whatever landfill fire they put in front of him.	golikehellmachine	t3_6ehf0u

For instance, the first country in the list above, Lithuania, has a per capita income of $15,000. 22% are living under poverty (earning below $265/month, or $3,180 annually) - that's almost a quarter of the population. Unemployment rate is ~8.5%.  To put that into perspective, only two states in the U.S. has a lower GDP than Lithuania ($41b) - Wyoming ($40b) and Vermont ($31b). The per capita income is $29,698 and $52,776 for Wyoming and Vermont respectively. The poverty line in U.S. is $22,162 per annum, and people living under poverty in Wyoming is 11.2% and Vermont is 10.2%. Finally, unemployment is at 4.8% and 3.1%.  Lithuania is very much a developing nation, and even adjusted for standard of living, I cannot imagine it offers a better living environment for growing children.	Trombosaurus	t1_diaacyk

Obama's focus on OFA came *at the expense* of the DNC, and that significantly weakened the DNC's abilities. Not just for Clinton, but for the party as a whole. All those downticket state races that Democrats have been losing? They were casualties of the focus on OFA, an organization that's only ever worked for one candidate, in two races.

t3_6ehf0u	t1_diaf8up	1496264995	&gt;Whatever the reason, the result is a president who seems to have trouble learning fundamental facts even on the job. No conspiracy theory around Trump’s presidency is as frightening as this incompetence. **The power of the presidency has reached extraordinary heights, and now that power lies in the hands of a man who, when confronted with risks, may simply tune out — or who may be dissuaded from danger, then forget in a few weeks why he was wrong and make the mistake anyway.** “When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I’m basically the same,” Trump once said. Now the first-grader is driving the car, he doesn’t care to learn how to steer and the rest of us are trapped as passengers.  emphasis added	SaltLakeCitySlicker	t1_diackmu

t3_6ehund	t1_diafyet	1496265816	Yeah that's actually kind of huge. What does the national level party really do in a primary? Fundraise for state parties (which Clinton largely sucked up) and work to get eyes on the race (through primaries, GOTV drives etc...) and the DNC didn't do shit until the race looked close around the new year and suddenly there were a bunch more debates scheduled.   Don't get me wrong, Sanders lost fair and square, at least in the beginning of the race and arguably to this day he's pretty terrible at communicating his message to anyone that wasn't already sympathetic to it. But that's what pisses me off, he was at one point polling within single digits of the biggest name the Democrats have run in decades *only* because there were so many people dying for someone to push what he pushed and the Democrats *still* treat most of those ideas as fringe.   I'll vote Dem because there's no other option, but goddamn if the Democrats aren't the biggest fucking morons on the damn planet. I could take a steaming shit after eating nothing but oysters and old beans for a week and it'd have a better chance of coming up with a winning strategy than the DNC.

t3_6ehr4u	t1_diag1lx	1496265922	Russia is immune against western election interference as it is a de facto authoritarian state. All major parties in Russia are more or less controlled behind the scenes by the kremlin. Their only true ideology is the search for more power.  How will we even triumph in the fight with this evil? They have successfully turned the western world against itself.  The sooner we purge this russian rot from the system the better,the western public fear a new cold war but the truth is that the old war never truly ended.   Want to know why Al Qaeda changed tactics from supporting the chechens in their war against Russia to attacking the "far enemy" the US? Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was held at a secret FSB prison in 1996 and then swiftly released. The person responsible for this was allegedy Alexander Litvinenko,the FSB spy that Putin personally signed the death warrant for after he switched sides.   Litvinenko knew things that would be devastating for the kremlin,how Yeltsin with the help of Putin and his FSB loyalists orchestrated the apartment bombings that restarted the conflict in Chechnya and brought Putin the massive popularity he needed to secure the win in the 2000 election.  Russia is our foremost enemy as it has been for the last 70 years.	lowenmeister	t1_diadrr4

Trump is the idiots idea of a smart person, a poor persons idea of a rich person, and a weak persons idea of a strong man. Trump is none of those things. He's old and fat, living off of his dad and grandpa's money. Trumps real-estate empire was collapsing in the 90s and sought to rebrand his name... By hanging out with the Clintons. He started selling his name, not properties. People assumed Trump meant success, and he sold that. He was smart in this one instance. Doesn't matter that almost everything he sold his name to tends to be fraudulent or goes under. Any of his shitty food lines, the infamous Trump University. He brands himself a winner, but often loses. Best part was. [When the housing market started collapsing and no one would lend to him, guess who did? The Russians](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/richard-dearlove-mi6-trump-russia-money-2008-financial-crisis-us-election-a7684341.html). Funnily enough, it was around this time Trump started rebranding himself as a republican too. Slowly but surely, and by 2012 he was full on GOP. Of course, he doesn't really know anything about either parties political policies, considering his stance on Russia was a complete 180 from the GOP's standard platform.	Stockpile_Tom	t1_diabkb4

By July, Gary Johnson and Bernie Sanders dank meme pages were steamrolled with propaganda from fake news sites like abcnewscom dot co (complete with stolen branding) whose articles were pro trump or anti-hillary.   The Gary Johnson Dank Meme Stash is still a pro-Trump cesspool since all the real Gary supporters left by the end of September. I haven't checked the Bernie Sanders page recently.  While I checked in every once in a while, I never "joined" the Jill Stein or Hillary Clinton dank meme groups, they didn't have enough population to keep it interesting.  I looked at the Donald Trump Dank Meme stash once. It was as if the people in there had no idea how to meme. It was like they missed the point.

t3_6ehr4u	t1_diah5l0	1496267204	Nobody from Russia knows local Michigan politics because outside of Michigan only maybe a few hundred people know local Michigan politics. For the information they used in the election you would need to know more then about the area then just what you could learn in a class.  Look up how many books have been published about politics in Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania within the last 10 years.  If you can find more then 5 combined I would be shocked.    You would have had to be around those areas or been in political campaigns in those areas to do what the Russian did with any success.    For a counterpoint nobody from the US has a grasp of local politics in Kalmykia.  I looked and no books exist on the subject that have been published this decade.  I also do not think you realize that Russians had fake news that targeted Democrats, Republicans, and undecided voters.  They also had fake news that targeted certain areas that was different from others that they used in swing states.  Im not saying Flynn, Kushner or Page had anything to do with how they decided who they targeted and with what.  None of those guys had the experience to run a operation like what was carried out.  Trump doesn't have the experience or knowledge on how to do it.  If you are looking at the Trump team Paul Manafort could have and  Roger Stone could have.  I am also not even suggesting it had to be somebody from Trump's team but it had to be an American and they had either helped on a national campaign or it was a bunch of people that had run campaigns in those states.

I think Clinton would have won anyways. It's appropriate to be angry about it but it's also important to remember that the Democrats, warts and all, are better in every way compared to the GOP and that if you want the Democratic party to improve that it's important to join, vote in the primaries, and run for office.

But too much has happened since then, too many violations, for liberals to take this lying down without calling out the hypocrisy. After all that was said and done about liberals, after all that Trump himself has said and done, it's just too much.  Point is, Trump is the absolute worst person in the world to be in charge of such a highly divided nation. People on both sides just keep getting angrier, and angrier, and angrier.

Remember his comment on Nuclear energy?    &gt;*Look, having nuclear—my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart —you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world—it’s true!—but when you’re a conservative Republican they try—oh, do they do a number—that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune—you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged—but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me—it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right—who would have thought?), but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners—now it used to be three, now it’s four—but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years—but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.*	UgaBoog	t3_6eirsj

t3_6eirsj	t1_diamimm	1496274038	Despite the "no shit" quality of the headline, the article does bring up at least one interesting point:  As president, Donald has had access to some of the best minds from anywhere.  We're talking about world class experts in anything from economics to science.  Yet after 4 months with this access, he's still a raging dumbass who doesn't know so many things, including simple things like what countries are in the Middle East or how to write a tweet that isn't complete nonsense.  He could call up or meet these top experts for advice on anything, but he instead chooses to watch TV, golf, and surround himself with incompetent butt-sucks and equally-useless family members.  He's been like that for much of his 70 years, he continued to be like that the past 4 months, and he'll continue to be like that for the rest of his days.  Millions of people expecting an old dumbass to suddenly open his mind to knowledge and "learn how to be presidential" is probably one of the most delusional things about this whole thing.

The reason our first form of government (Articles of Confederation) failed and needed to be replaced was because it defined a set of responsibilities to serve the people but did not give the government authority to raise the funds needed to fulfill those obligations.  The Constitution was v2.0 of our government and fixed that issue but politicians have been arguing about this ever since.  Ultimately I think it always should come back to one basic premise: If you create a rule or regulation, you must properly fund execution and oversight.  This 37 year war on properly funding the government that has been waged by the republican party has brought us to where we are today.

It provides evidence of how documents stolen from a prominent journalist and critic of Russia was tampered with and then “leaked” to achieve specific propaganda aims. We name this technique “tainted leaks.” The report illustrates how the twin strategies of phishing and tainted leaks are sometimes used in combination to infiltrate civil society targets, and to seed mistrust and disinformation. It also illustrates how domestic considerations, specifically concerns about regime security, can motivate espionage operations, particularly those targeting civil society."  There's also a great github repository here ( https://github.com/kbandla/APTnoteshttps://github.com/kbandla/APTnotes )... showing how various eastern-eurpoean and arguably Russian spyware and malware campaigns go back nearly 8 to 10 years.	jmnugent	t3_6eiw8w

t3_6eirsj	t1_diamwes	1496274555	Andrew Johnson couldn't read until he was an adult, his wife had to teach him. Not sure if that counts as stupidity, it was a common thing for a rural-born person at the time. Harding was prone to constant malapropisms like Bush, and he once lost the White House china in a poker game. Reagan was reportedly nothing but a senile old racist in private, but his acting experience gave him the discipline to morph into the Great Communicator once the cameras switched on. Believe it or not, FDR was extremely superstitious, and once set the price of gold to a number he considered lucky, and no other reason than that.   And of course, Dubya. There is some debate as to how stupid he was or if he was just terrible at memorizing his lines and blurted out hilarious crap. But there is one story where his stupidity had some effect. He had a meeting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with some congressmen and people from State. He asked one congressman, I can't remember his name, who was considered especially knowledgable in this area. He asked him if there was any country both sides trusted whose army could be used as peacekeeping force. The congressman said they could both be amenable to Sweden. Bush said "Sweden doesn't have an army." The congressman replied that they do, and perhaps the president misheard him as saying Switzerland. But Bush didn't budge, he kept saying Sweden has no army, and this meeting made very little progress because he refused to admit a mistake. Some weeks later Bush walked up to the congressman at a White House party, slapped him on the back, and jovially said "you were right, I did mean Switzerland!"	takeashill_pill	t1_diam5nc

t3_6eir89	t1_dian68o	1496274920	Although this is great news, this title is somewhat misleading.   We should keep in mind this is in regard to *retail electric generation*, not total state consumption or use (probably obvious to some but maybe not to others). [Here](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB100) is an official legislative digest of the bill from OPs post.  &gt; All electricity sold at retail [would] be generated by eligible renewable energy resources by December 31, 2045  This bill, SB 100, is essentially raising CA's renewable energy portfolio, which is a state-based policy calling for retail utilities to originate from a set percentage of renewable energy; in this case, California would have all of its **sold** electricity come from solar, wind, biofuel, etc.   [Here](http://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/renewable-portfolio-standards.aspx) is a reference for which of the states have a Renewable Portfolio Standard!   I think this is super cool -- and as a Californian, can't wait to see other state's follow suit.   **Source:** College student who just started studying renewable energy portfolio standards at state-scale in a small public policy research fellowship!

t3_6eh10y	t1_dian6u1	1496274943	Slovenia is a beautiful country and is developing in many positive ways. I think honestly it flies under the radar as it is such a geographically small nation. For example, a lot of people here in the UK don't even realise where exactly Slovenia is on a map. The name sounds very typically "Eastern European" (ie Slavic) in English so people assume vaguely that's where the country is. (It's not, I know).    Also as Slovenia did not see the worst of the fighting in the Balkan wars, the country's profile is lower than Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia. These countries were in the news a lot in the early 90's so people are more familiar with their names even if they don't know much about them.	ReelBigMidget	t1_diafdft
