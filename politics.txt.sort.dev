Or scared that while Trump doesn't actually care about any of the positions he happens to take at any given moment, there still exist the far right nationalist forces that helped to elect him and more adept politicians who are willing to exploit it in the future?

There is not one thing they are trying to do that will not cause harm to most Americans.   The Kansas election yesterday was infuriating. Kansas has suffered more than any other state under Republican leadership. Their Democrat governor was replaced with Brownback who proceeded to loot the state. And I'm supposed to be happy that the race was close? I'm apalled. I cannot believe ANYONE in Kansas showed up to vote for a Republican yesterday. There is an endless amount of proof that the party is harming the people of that state, and those people just don't care. And they are forcing that evil onto the rest of us.   It is sickening.

Use their moment in the sun to break procedural norms and do things that before would be considered beyond the pale. Force value system down the throats of entire state/country.  This sprint to undo their predecessors' achievements is quickly becoming a full-on Constitutional crisis. Our government and society are not meant to swing so wildly from extreme to extreme. The destruction of the filibuster, regardless of who you would like to blame for it or which side is currently taking advantage of it, only worsens this careening effect because now even SCOTUS is primed to become ruled by extreme partisans over the course of the next 15-20 years.  I would not be surprised if this gets rejected by the courts now, so you might be right on that point.

t3_651njm	t1_dg6t3f6	1492041981	This article is extraordinary. Cohen was basically a money launderer for the Russian mob. The court details and testimony really point to what a douchy guilty asshole he is. The article sums up as essentially this:   &gt;When Cohen testified in 2007 that he did not know Malakhov and did not transfer money to Russia he probably told the truth, though he left room for maneuver by saying “to the best of my knowledge”. Cohen’s money laundering scheme was different. Indeed, money did not leave the USA. Cohen received money to one of his accounts, confirmed its receipt, and then the owner of the money (Buslaev in this case) received $350,000 in Russia from a different person, who had to get $350.000 out of Russia. After Buslaev’s confirmation that the money was received in Russia, Cohen released $350,000 to American accounts indicated by the client in Moscow. As a result of this simple transaction, Buslaev received absolutely clean $350.000, most likely in cash; Cohen transferred absolutely clean $350.000 received from the hockey player Malakhov to some other American accounts, where this money further stayed absolutely clean because they had not crossed the border and never raised suspicions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the FBI. Most probably, Cohen did all this for an interest because it is unlikely that he did this for free.	mydoghasocd	t3_651njm

Schools having to declare that the US was created as a Christian nation, rather than Enlightenment Principles?  If Churches cannot lose their tax-exempt status?  If a Fetus has more rights than the mother that carries it?  If Marriage is defined as one-man/one-woman??  If all marriages previous made that are one-man/one-woman are annulled?  If hate crimes legislation on the basis of sexual orientation is abolished?  If private and public entities are allowed to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation?

t3_6528qs	t1_dg6zkmp	1492049914	I guess "reform" is relative.  &gt;After the last corporate tax holiday in 2004, a Senate investigation found the top 15 companies benefiting from the break cut more than 20,000 jobs and cost the US Treasury around $3.3 in lost revenues. The dollar strengthened about 13 per cent the next year, but most economists credit this to the Federal Reserve’s decision to almost double its benchmark interest rate. ___ &gt;While it may not boost the US economy, Mr Trump’s plan could encourage corporations to continue holding their earnings offshore in between tax holidays — and give them the funds to lobby for more. According to the Oxfam report, this means more of a tax burden on American citizens and small businesses.  &gt;“The losers in this rigged game are small businesses and working families who don’t have the means to shift profits among hundreds of offshore subsidiaries or the ability to deploy armies of lobbyists to preserve their favourite tax loophole,” the report reads. ____  &gt;The proportion of federal revenue paid by corporate taxes has dropped from $1 of every $3 in 1952 to $1 of every $9 in 2015, according to the Office of Management and Budget.  &gt;Meanwhile, payroll taxes — which disproportionately affect low-income workers — have increased by more than nine per cent in the same time frame.

t3_653gun	t1_dg78gxk	1492064096	Well, he has done a few other things....  Gareth John Evans AC, QC (born 5 September 1944), is an Australian international policymaker and former politician. An academic lawyer and barrister by profession, he represented the Australian Labor Party in the Senate and House of Representatives from 1978 to 1999, serving as a Cabinet Minister in the Hawke and Keating governments from 1983 to 1996 as Attorney-General, Minister for Resources and Energy, Minister for Transport and Communications and most prominently, from 1988 to 1996, as Foreign Minister. He was Leader of the Government in the Senate from 1993 to 1996, Deputy Leader of the Opposition from 1996 to 1998, and remains one of the two longest-serving federal Cabinet Ministers in Labor Party history.[1]  After leaving politics, he was President and Chief Executive Officer of the Brussels-based International Crisis Group from 2000 to 2009. On returning to Australia he was appointed in 2009 honorary professorial fellow at the University of Melbourne. He has served on a number of major international commissions and panels, including as co-chair of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (2000–01) and International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament (2008–10). Evans has written extensively on international relations and legal, constitutional and political affairs, and has been internationally recognised for his contributions to the theory and practice of mass atrocity and conflict prevention, arms control and disarmament. (wiki)	trump_peed_on_me	t1_dg784uc
t3_653gun	t1_dg790uc	1492065457	Well, besides being a politician and a chairman of an Australian university, he's done a few other things....   "Evans has written or edited eleven books, most recently "Inside the Hawke-Keating Government: A Cabinet Diary" (Melbourne University Press, 2014).His other major works include The Responsibility to Protect: Ending Mass Atrocity Crimes Once and for All (Brookings Institution Press, September 2008, paperback edition 2009),[30] which was awarded an Honorable Mention in the US Council on Foreign Relations Arthur Ross Book Award 2009 as one of the best three books on international relations published in the previous year, as well as Australia's Foreign Relations (with Bruce Grant, Melbourne University Press 1991, 2nd ed 1995), Cooperating for Peace: The Global Agenda for the 1990s (Allen &amp; Unwin,1993), Australia's Constitution (with John McMillan and Haddon Storey, Allen &amp; Unwin, 1983) and the edited collection, Labor and the Constitution, 1972–1975 (Heinemann, 1977). He co-edited the annual Labor Essays series from 1980 to 1982.  Evans won the 1995 Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order (following Mikhail Gorbachev the year before ) for his Fall 1994 Foreign Policy article, 'Cooperative Security and Intra-State Conflict', which was cited as presenting ideas that, following the end of the Cold War 'could quicken the process … to help maintain a new world order'. He described 'cooperative security' as being a single conceptual theme that effectively captured the essence of three more familiar concepts in international security discourse, viz. comprehensive security, common security and collective security. Its defining – and attractive – characteristics were that 'the term tends to connote consultation rather than confrontation, reassurance rather than deterrence, transparency rather than secrecy, prevention rather than correction, and interdependence rather than unilateralism'  On 11 June 2012, Evans was named a Companion of the Order of Australia for "eminent service to international relations, particularly in the Asia Pacific Region as an adviser to governments on a range of global policy matters, to conflict prevention and resolution, and to arms control and disarmament."[40] He had previously been made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 2001 for "service to the Australian Parliament, particularly through advancing Australia's foreign policy and trade interests, especially in Asia and through the United Nations", and has been awarded Honorary Doctorates of Laws by the University of Melbourne in 2002, Carleton University in 2005, the University of Sydney in 2008 and Queen's University Ontario in 2010. In October 2005 he and the International Crisis Group were named European and Asian 'Heroes of 2005'. In July 2008, he was selected as an inaugural fellow of the Australian Institute of International Affairs in recognition of his 'outstanding contribution to Australian international relations'. In May 2010 he was awarded the 2010 Roosevelt Institute Four Freedoms Award for Freedom from Fear for his pioneering work on the responsibility to protect concept and his contributions to conflict prevention and resolution, arms control and disarmament. In October 2011, he was presented by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, led by Sam Nunn and Ted Turner, the Amartya Sen Award 'for intrepid and creative leadership in creating momentum toward a world free of nuclear weapons'. In December 2011 Foreign Policy magazine cited him, along with Francis Deng, as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers for 2011 "for making 'the responsibility to protect' more than academic".  Earlier in his career he was designated Australian Humanist of the Year in 1990 by the Council of Australian Humanist Societies, won the ANZAC Peace Prize in 1994 for his 'leadership role in the Cambodian Peace Process, was awarded in 1995 the prestigious University of Louisville $150 000 Grawemeyer Prize for Ideas Improving World Order for his 1994 Foreign Policy article "Cooperative Security and Intrastate Conflict", and in 1999 received the Chilean Order of Merit (Grand Officer) for his work in initiating APEC.  In April 2007, Evans gave a lecture entitled "Preventing Mass Atrocities: Making 'Never Again' a Reality" at the University of San Diego's Joan B.

t3_655uh4	t1_dg7n1jv	1492094694	Or...you know, there's not that many immigrants here illegally from Europe and most people wouldn't be able to spot them if they tried.  But if you live in an area with heavy illegal immigration it's pretty noticeable, it's easy to tell which ones are legal and not legal if you live around them.  My uncle lived in a trailer park in Florida that was literally like 60% illegal and the ones here illegally would blast polka music and there'd always be like 20 of them to a trailer.  The ones here legally were just normal people, 2-4 to a trailer, sometimes more depending on how many kids they had. You could also spot the ones here illegally by how they acted when the police were driving through, the ones here illegally would be really skittish and start going inside and the ones here legally would just be normal.  My point is - the vast majority of illegal immigrants are not from Europe, I'd have to go look at the numbers but well over 90% are Hispanic. Because they're the vast majority, people view them in a different way.  Edit: To be clear here, I'm not attacking them, I had many friends in that park here illegally and overall they were good people, they'd always have cookouts and were always offering food to people passing by, I had no problem with them. The first time I went to my uncles trailer park to visit him they stopped us in the middle of the road and gave us a plate of food. It's also worth pointing out that my grandmother lived in that park when I was younger and I'd stay with her for a week or so at a time and all of my early childhood best friends were kids from illegal families.	pizzashill	t3_655uh4

t3_655uh4	t1_dg7ngy0	1492095184	A nice quote that is relevant to the article: "Racism is the lowest, most crudely primitive form of collectivism. It is the notion of ascribing moral, social or political significance to a man’s genetic lineage—the notion that a man’s intellectual and characterological traits are produced and transmitted by his internal body chemistry. Which means, in practice, that a man is to be judged, not by his own character and actions, but by the characters and actions of a collective of ancestors. Racism claims that the content of a man’s mind (not his cognitive apparatus, but its content) is inherited; that a man’s convictions, values and character are determined before he is born, by physical factors beyond his control. This is the caveman’s version of the doctrine of innate ideas—or of inherited knowledge—which has been thoroughly refuted by philosophy and science. Racism is a doctrine of, by and for brutes. It is a barnyard or stock-farm version of collectivism, appropriate to a mentality that differentiates between various breeds of animals, but not between animals and men. Like every form of determinism, racism invalidates the specific attribute which distinguishes man from all other living species: his rational faculty. Racism negates two aspects of man’s life: reason and choice, or mind and morality, replacing them with chemical predestination."	TrumpsRightSock	t3_655uh4

It's not completely insane to think that sort of behavior could come over if we become considerably less diligent in our separation of church and state.  &gt;As long as churches are non-partisan they should be tax-exempt.  I understand this is your opinion, but you may be missing the point of the law. Churches are tax exempt as part of the separation of Church and State. If Churches can advocate for candidates, they're violating that separation - and inherently, they'll advocate for candidates who try to further eradicate that separation. This may not lead to a slope, but it certainly increases the chances.	Cuckinandshillin	t1_dg6vpxy

t3_655uh4	t1_dg85ays	1492114336	The idea that low skilled immigration is a drain is foolish. Low skilled immigrants start businesses and increase overall diversity. Doing a Canada system of high skilled economic immigration to cast a wide net for humanitarian immigration is probably the most wffective, but not every country has a population of Canadians who will allow such a system to work without screaming about rapist immigrants.  The idea that Asia sends only skilled immigrants is also a little strange. All those Vietnamese people aren't running nail salons (which sounds racist but is actually true. My viet fiancée explained that the association is because a smart viet lady pened a nail salon and then made a business helping other viet folks around the country do the same. I imagine a similar story played out with Korean folks and dry cleaning shops)(also, a major economic boon, opening a small business) because it meshes so well with their training in biochemistry. They did it because they were low skill, and because opening a nail salon (or a restaurant, or a corner store) is a way that someone who is willing to work long hours for low pay at a backbreaking job can start to generate an income with few skills and minimal startup capital. They send skilled immigrants recently, but the vast bulk of Asian immigrants through history up until very recently came with few skills and created economic benefits.  We want low skill immigrants because they will work hard for relatively lower pay than our coddled countrymen, and they'll put their kids through higher education and make them the upper middle class skilled workers you're talking about. But that only works when they have legal status and protections like we have the Vietnamese, Cubans, and the Koreans in the late 20th, various Europeans before, and like we conspicuously avoid giving to the people coming from Central America today.

The issue is the democratic party is fucking garbage on every level and their voters, people like you, just act like children instead of adults and can't fix your own problems.   The democratic party, has a history of appeasing republicans at every turn and fucking over its constituency just so they can keep their lucrative careers as "public servants".  For example, Hillary Clinton. Name one time in her entire career, from Walmart to campaigning for POTUS in which she has EVER taken a stance that wasn't simply in line with whatever was popular at the time.   Never, she never has. When Walmart attacked workers, hillary sat back  When republicans attacked the gay community she obliged and supported it.   Same with drugs, same with privacy, same with war. Etc etc   This is why democrats and not republicans, are on their way out.

t3_655uh4	t1_dg8bned	1492121905	Horseshit clickbait title.   The "reason" is that there's no ocean between Mexico and America.  It's a lot easier to get here illegally in the first place.  The title should say "There's a reason so many illegal immigrants are Latino, not Euro", and it's simple - that's just who is coming now, and it's the facts.  There's no overwhelming wave of millions of undocumented Irish or Chinese.  They're just not here in numbers.  That was the latter half of the 1800s, when we had railroads to build.  Europeans who do want to immigrate, even illegally, don't come to America. They want to go to England or France or Germany, which they can do much easier.  The racism fairy isn't what makes the guys at the day labor pickup Hispanics, the circumstances of life is what does it.  The billions they send home to their families is what does it.  They have an incentive, as many Europeans and Chinese once did before coming here.	HaveaManhattan	t3_655uh4

If you go to your doctor, and he tells you have cancer, and these are the specific tests that show you have cancer, how many more doctors telling you, "you have cancer" before you need to start believing that you have cancer? When 97 doctors are unanimously telling you that you have cancer and that you need to have a life style change to survive would you just say, "Nanananana, 2 doctors said I *might* not have cancer and 1 doctor said I *don't* have cancer so I don't need to do shit, life is all peaches and gravy I'm just going to keep smoking my favorite Cubano and drinking to my liver's content." I don't think it will take 100 doctors to convince any of the ardent climate change deniers that they have cancer when push comes to shove.

According to experts, the **“Trump Slump” in travel sales is going to cost the US over $7 billion this year alone.**  The travel guide **Frommer’s has set the decline in foreign tourism at 6.8 percent for this year, while ForwardKeys points out a 6.5 percent decrease in international travel** to the United States in the week after Trump attempted his first Muslim ban back in January.  During that same time period, they found that **US-bound flights from Western Europe went down 14 percent, while these flights from the Middle East crashed 38 percent.**  To make matters even worse, the Global Business Travel Association has concluded that **“45 percent of European business travel professionals say they are less likely to schedule meetings or events in the US.**	USpolitics2017	t3_65aunz

Trump will do something to affect their lives and they'll go through a period of confusion. They'll seek out people who were went through the same thing, and they'll adopt a new stance.   This is an important moment as we could be the friends they seek, or it could be someone else. It could lead deeper down the alt-right rabbit hole or it could be their moment of clarity.   Personally, I try not to berate them when they come around. They're victims in some aspect. They bought into the hype, they were fleeced, and/or they allowed someone to prey upon their emotions.

t3_65bwa9	t1_dg93jy7	1492174973	I'm not the biggest Trump supporter or anything (I did vote for him, but only because he's more palatable to me than Clinton was), but the MSM was horribly biased against the guy.  I mean the laundry list of shit they said about him that ended up not being true is getting pretty long, and a lot of the other stuff that hasn't been disproven hasn't been proven.  Then on top of all of that, Obama had a habit of hiring spouses of media company executives as his staffers, which may be part of the reasons that he's one of the most popular presidents despite not getting much done, and going back on a lot of the major promises he made that had me vote for him (closing Gitmo, nullifying the Patriot Act, etc.).	soupvsjonez	t1_dg90xgq

t3_65bxks	t1_dg93r8y	1492175323	Why is this politics?  Incidentally, my favorite example of this sort of argument is dudes who get pissed because sci-fi is infected with all this social justice bullshit now, not like back in the day when we had STAR TREK! Guys, we have to do something!  Did they actually watch Star Trek? Did they...understand Star Trek?  This all strikes me as symptomatic of that fucking ridiculous mindset that anything that includes any minority is virtue signaling, or storytelling and diversity are mutually exclusive. Really, it's all fake bullshit to include people or to give a shit about anyone else, as no one could actually WANT that. No, everyone else is just like me - a cynical human being unmoored in the world, adrift, threatened by change and the prospect that everyone is stealing from me a birthright that I never really had.	seventeenblackbirds	t3_65bxks
t3_65bxks	t1_dg93ydg	1492175656	Yeah this is nonsense. They've had WORLD CHANGING CROSSOVERS happening every 4-6 months for the last decade, and the stories are nonsense. SHOCKING CHARACTER DEATHS that are reversed within months, or sometimes days. (Thor's big climactic death in Fear Itself was reversed in the same issue!) People are tired of their shit. And then, they try to blame the new characters, many of which are actually the only thing selling. They have new #1 issues every year for many of their titles. It's a goddamn mess for story writing, and anyone who reads can tell them where the problems are.	DrPoopEsq	t1_dg90r5c

Before you trust your sources (and we all come to trust our sources, simply because we *can't* chase every story we hear) double- and triple-check what they've been saying, from *independent* sources, and from people who have no bone in the matter.   You might find some of your facts to be... not so factual. :-)  Edit: Also, please, please make sure your representatives in the House and Senate are voting *your* wishes, and not those of external influences.

t3_65bxks	t1_dg9kp1x	1492196194	I've read quite a few Marvel comics and in general I really hate the concept of legacy characters. I think changing the character behind the costume is cheap, it implies the character itself is not important, just the broad concept of the hero has value. The fact that lately Marvel has replaced a lot of the "legacy" characters with various minorities does feel like pandering...Maybe I'd be fine with it if Marvel's staff was also a diverse bunch. The majority of the editors and writers are white male, so I question how genuinely they want to capture minority voices. Having said all that, I think the biggest problem with Marvel are the never ending events and the really bad stories. Personally, I got very frustrated with a few of their retcons that were totally unnecessary, so I refuse to buy Marvel as a result.	vegastar7	t3_65bxks
t3_65bwa9	t1_dg9nhx3	1492199573	I don't trust any news source, but I do have a set of general rules that I apply.  RT is going to be honest on US politics when it doesn't concern Russian politics.  They want us to look bad, and we do enough bad shit that they don't need to make anything up.   BBC is a bit removed from CNN, Fox, MSNBC, or any other agency owned by the big six media conglomerates in the US, but they still have a lot of contacts between them, and answer to the 5 western intelligence agencies.  A lot of alternative media is outright wrong a lot of the time because they don't have the resources that the bigger companies do.  Also weird shit like lizard alien men.  I'll still listen to Alex Jones occasionally for the same reasons I listen to coast to coast.  That shit is entertaining.  Wikileaks is very diligent about not posting anything that is factually false, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they don't omit things.  They haven't been caught doing this, but that's a hard thing to prove.  Anything that they do end up posting is very likely to be true though as can be seen by the Clinton campaigns defense of "They shouldn't have that information" instead of "that information isn't true".  What's more, one of the laws that Obama signed in his last year allows intelligence services, and news agencies to legally use propaganda against US citizens.	soupvsjonez	t1_dg97zii
t3_65bwa9	t1_dg9nw8n	1492200046	Yes, that video of him bragging about groping women and then women subsequently saying "Yup, he did that to me" were completely false. And that video of him saying Mexicans bring drugs, crime, or asking the Russians to hack Hillary, or just being a general jackass throughout the campaign: ALL FALSE (it was done by the media with a Trump look-alike). And then, that completely fake story about him  scamming people through his university! The guy paid a settlement, so clearly he did nothing wrong. And why were people hounding him about his tax returns? It's not like Hillary released ten years worth of tax returns. But beyond all that, the media never focused on the issues. Like Healthcare: Trump had a great plan. Repeal Obamacare and replace it with something better. Something so freaking awesome, he couldn't even tell us how he was going to actually it... In all honesty, if I were you, I'd consider never voting again.	vegastar7	t1_dg93jy7
t3_65bxks	t1_dg9qtwy	1492203598	It's not like legacy characters are a new thing, though. Marvel hasn't been as into it as DC, but how many people have held the title of Captain America?	whollyfictional	t1_dg9kp1x
t3_656oo5	t1_dg9sa8o	1492205435	Speaking of not trusting contradictions, I'm having a harder and harder time listening to statements about Trump.  For example:  Trump could not have built his business on his own, because he isn't smart enough or have the business knowledge to.  That means others must have helped him and he listened to their advice and knowledge.  Instead though, people keep saying that all he did is surround himself with 'yes men' that agreed with whatever he wanted.  One of these statements can be true, but not both.  It's like whenever trump decides something he's a 'loose cannon'...whenever he listens to advice and delegates 'he's just not smart enough to have his own ideas' or 'he's caving'.  Again, it can't be both ways all of the time.  The military decided on the course of action with this bombing after they were given permission to use what tools they thought best by Trump.  It appears that it has been highly successful with no loss of civilian life.  Does our military have no knowledge of history or geopolitics?  Because it was their decision.  Trump just said he trusted them to make the right decision in this.	at132pm	t1_dg9f1f6

t3_65bxks	t1_dga04dh	1492215807	I think, that apart from Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson,  "US Agent" (who's real name I forgot) was also Captain America...Wait, I forgot about Bucky. I just don't like the idea of legacy characters. For instance, a Batman that isn't Bruce Wayne isn't compelling (for me anyway). Avenging your parents' death by dressing like a bat and fight crime is kind of insane, and yes, Bruce Wayne was seriously scarred by that experience. But then if you're the second or third guy to wear a bat costume, it kind of loses the "this guy needs mental help" vibe that makes the original Batman so interesting. But going back to Marvel: I think whatever problem Marvel has with keeping readers has more to do with crappy stories than the racial / gender identity of the characters.	vegastar7	t1_dg9qtwy
t3_655uh4	t1_dga05h3	1492215848	But all the data so far shows the opposite. There's very little social mobility in this country. If you're rich and highly skilled, your kids are likely going to be rich and highly skilled. 2nd generation Hispanics do show a slight increase in graduation rates but by the third generation, it stabilises and graduation rates both at college and high school are far lower than Asians and Whites. There's far more advantage in increasing the number of skilled immigrants - studies show that the average skilled immigrant produces 2.6 jobs while low skilled immigrants are a drain. The kids are likely to be low skilled and low skilled workers are going to be a drain on tax budgets.   Low skilled immigrants are actually less likely to start their own businesses. They're more likely to be employed in service and manual labor jobs. Their kids are also more likely to work in low skilled jobs rather than starting their own businesses. High skilled immigrants are much more likely to start their own businesses. We need entrepreneurs not laborers.   The economy does need low skilled workers. I agree and these workers can be brought in through migrant worker visas for example. Our immigration system should be skills based like every other western country rather than being primarily based on family reunification. We should also increase the number of immigrants (from 1 million to 2.5 million annually but they should mostly be skilled rather then low skilled). Our economy does not need the laborer but needs the engineer. Most Latin American immigrants come though family reunification and 30% don't even have high school diplomas.   And as for your point about Vietnamese immigrants, many Vietnamese came through refugee programs and their kids are still low skilled compared to the rest of the Asian population. More than six-in-ten (61%) adults ages 25 to 64 who have come from Asia in recent years have at least a bachelor’s degree. This is much higher than the rate of immigrants from Latin American countries. Furthermore, Asian-Americans are a varied group but there's a reason why they have the highest median salary. It's because they have degrees and are high skilled while Latin Americans are likely to be poor and low skilled. Nearly every study suggests that skilled immigrants are much more beneficial than low skilled workers.	nonu731	t1_dg85ays

Then she learned that the section was reserved for minority students. &gt; &gt; “I am especially disappointed that the University encourages these and other discriminatory programs,” she wrote in the Stanford Review. “We need to allow each person to define his or her own achievements instead of assuming competence or incompetence based on race.”	FoucinJerk	t1_dga2eqg

t3_65ga2w	t1_dga4ag2	1492221483	Obviously everyone can be discriminated against, no one is disputing that. The difference arises when comparing discrimination with systemic discrimination, and white people certainly aren't under any threat from that.	Mageman603	t1_dga358j
t3_65ga2w	t1_dga4hrz	1492221775	Discrimination is discrimination.  Period. It's hilarious how liberals add words like you just did to try and act like it's ok to attack a white person just because they are white.	Kirito1917	t1_dga4ag2

I just thought that he was the better shithead out of the choice between the two shitheads we had to vote for.    He's undeniably a sexist.  As far as the tax returns go though, I don't know if you keep up with Rachel Maddow or not, but she broke a big story where they got a hold of some of his tax returns, and it looks like he pays his fair share of taxes. The quote that you are taking out of context where he asked the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's emails was an obvious joke when taken in context.  Like I said in my previous comment though, I wasn't happy about voting for him, but the TPP was axed so I consider everything else a wash so far.

White people haven't suffered like (insert minority) so they should just get over it and accept it.  I mean we gotta pay for our "White Privilege" right?	Kirito1917	t1_dga4ms1

t3_65ga2w	t1_dgabv40	1492233624	No, I'm saying there is a difference between individual cases of discrimination and the fact that the way the system is set up as a whole makes it harder to be successful for certain groups. It would be ridiculous to equate those because "every act of discrimination is equal". They aren't.	Mageman603	t1_dgabs3b
t3_65ga2w	t1_dgac7mz	1492234317	Of course not every act of discrimination is equal.  But that doesn't diminish the fact that discrimination is still discrimination.  There are even individual cases where white people can be discriminated against far worse then your "systematic oppression" bullshit.  Remember that handicap kid who was tortured for being white live on Facebook?    You can say again and again that you are not trying to justify or excuse discrimination against a specific group all you want but saying it in a fancy way with the usual liberal added vocabulary to the subject doesn't change what you are really saying. Even if you yourself don't realize it.  What you are basically saying is that while discrimination is bad regardless of who it's done to, white people dont suffer the "systemic discrimination" that poor poor minorities do and thus it isn't as big a deal or a bad as it would be if it was happing to a black person or other.  That is what you are saying wether you realize it or not.  Or more accurately. Wether you will admit it or not.    Let me ask you this question.  If Jackson had been black would this article have ever been written?	Kirito1917	t1_dgabv40
t3_65ga2w	t1_dgach34	1492234867	Look, every individual act of discrimination is terrible. But you're trying to equate 2 very different things. It seems like you're denying that the system is rigged against people of color and other minorities so that it is often much more difficult to be successful.	Mageman603	t1_dgac7mz
t3_65ga2w	t1_dgactsp	1492235634	And it seems you're trying to insinuate that because white people are "privileged" it's not as big a deal if they get discriminated against. Even if their individual case is far worse then what's happing to any minority in your "rigged system".   Exactly why are they different?  You've yet to explain that.   Yeah and the system is just soooooo awful for minorities.   Tell me. How many White only scholarships are there?  Colleges?  What about government agencies who's sole purpose is to further white peoples cause?  When was the last time a white personal was helped by affirmative action?  Maybe a few decades ago you had a point.  But It's 2017 dude.  Get with the times.	Kirito1917	t1_dgach34

t3_65j96p	t1_dgaop45	1492265807	&gt;As Easter Sunday arrives, President Donald Trump has not attended a church service in the capital since the worship events of his inauguration weekend.  &gt;Trump is spending the holiday at his private Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, where he often weekends. The White House would not say if he'd go to Easter services, but last year he attended the nearby Episcopalian church where he and Melania Trump were married.  &gt;Where the president worships is always of interest in Washington. But compared to the buzz in 2009 over whether the Obamas would join a church, there has been less chatter this year. Some of the more liberal churches oppose Trump's policies. Also, he's out of town a lot of weekends. And he's not seen as a committed churchgoer anyway.  &gt;To be sure, Obama attended church only occasionally.  While obviously not as important as other issues at the present time, this article caught my interest. It seems so small when compared to everything else, and I personally don't give a damn whether or not the president goes to church at all, but I feel like in previous ~~elections~~ presidencies this mattered to people.   I'm honestly glad it doesn't matter. But I also think this shows both how 1) the country is becoming progressively less religious on the whole and 2) the American right wing has drifted from the evangelical Christian core we typically think of.

He probably feels like America is badly in need of his help and he is setting aside his comfortable position as a wealthy business owner to take this low paying job so he can serve his county. You should be thanking him the same way you thank a military serviceman for their sacrafice and service.  It's amazingly arrogant.

t3_65jqef	t1_dgatoev	1492273104	I think the issue is that when it comes to partisanship. Currently the right refuses to acknowledge it when it comes to things like climate change, forensic science, etc. Skepticism is a social issue because many of them choose to ignore it and choose to ignore facts for conspiracy theories.  Also not every scientist is just staying at home. The EPA and DOJ have already cut many programs and laid off many who are in programs they don't believe in.  Many scientist will be at the march. They've announce who will be there on social media. Even scientist can be activists, especially at a time when your government ignores science and facts.	markj79	t1_dgat4ow

"Real" scientists won't be there, so you can conveniently say that no one who shows up is "really" a scientist, so you can just go ahead and disregard whatever gets said because it's not sufficiently legitimate. Rhetorically it's a weaselly little dodge, which is what I'd expect from that source.  This administration's stances on environmental science, climate change, public health, medical research, and regulation on the dumping of toxic chemicals are all very well documented by their own actions.	seventeenblackbirds	t1_dgat4ow

Trump on the other hand has done basically everything he criticized Obama for. He is not just someone who admits he was wrong and changes his opinion; he blatantly lies about having the new opinion all along.   When he lost the popular vote he could have said he understand that America is divided and he'll do his best to make America great again for everyone. Nope, gotta lie about voter fraud and delegitimize the US election process and its democracy. He then lied about his electoral win was the biggest win in recent times. All just to brush his ego.   When much less people showed up to his inauguration than Obama's he could have made a comment on how important Obama was to USA as the first black president, or even say something cheesy like "can't have sunshine every day". Nope, gotta lie about the inauguration numbers.  We understand that politicians change their opinions sometimes. Trump isn't doing that. He is a compulsive liar and will lie himself out of a situation that wasn't even bad.

That one instance of rare false rape accusations would allow them to launch entire careers based on the fact that white men are disadvantaged in society.

t3_65p3me	t1_dgc2jz7	1492352272	That's just it. You can't say the Duke Lacross Case was an example of White Privilege. Even if you accept the convoluted explanation of the fact that Miller and Spencer rode on the coattails of the Case, you are being extremely disingenuous to accuse the whole case of being an example of privilege.  This is the problem with the extreme left and their crazed notion that white men have it better in life because they are white men.   It ignores hardships, like poverty. A poor white man will have the same struggles to provide as a poor black man. And some programs will actively deny services to whites because of "privilege"  It supposes genetic superiority or inferiority based on race (Affirmative Action). Whites are held to higher standards on entrance exams in order to fill artificial quotas on minority entrance, regardless of the fact that the white student and the minority student attend the same schools with the same economic backgrounds.   It ignores the fact that sometimes sexism works in favor of women. Women can be more likely to get in-person sales jobs, for example, because they can use sexual enticement to sell.  The Wage Gap that people love to tote about is largely fake, with the largest differences in the average wage based on where certain groups are likely to be employed. Two store clerks at the same store generally get the same wage, with length of time on the job being the factor in differences. The Wage Gap also ignores differences in the number of hours worked, with men being more likely to work overtime and women more likely to take time off.  This shit is complex, and you can not say that any one person is more privileged or less privileged based solely on race and gender.  Edit: love the fact that you get instantly downvoted for having the "wrong" opinion.	kinyutaka	t1_dgc1wig

t3_65p3me	t1_dgc540k	1492356118	&gt;Women can be more likely to get in-person sales jobs, for example, because they can use sexual enticement to sell.  Yeah and that's really the fault of men anyway. Women aren't selling sex to other women, men are fuckin buying it. Who are the ones demanding women become armpieces and sex objects? Who is it that said he can't be alone with women due to sexual temptations, was it a woman or was it the vice president?  But even if you don't care that men are the ones demanding it, men get hired for construction more. Men get hired for all kinds of jobs more because of differences between men and women that you really can't undo. You can't really undo physical factors. It's hard to undo that men are more likely to buy something if an attractive women sells it. It's even harder to undo it when people are going around yelling about reverse sexism.  Those studies where they take the names off applications with the same qualifications, men and women are hired about equally. And then they stick names on and women get hired at like 35% to mens 65%. For jobs that women are just as capable of doing. Those studies exist, they're real.   &gt;The Wage Gap also ignores differences in the number of hours worked, with men being more likely to work overtime and women more likely to take time off.  And they've done studies where these things are accounted for and it still exists.  Even if when you accounted for everything, the pay gap disappeared, it's still a problem. Women have disadvantages that they really don't have much control over. It'd be more fair if society accommodated for those differences. We should recognize that women hold up half the sky and treat them accordingly. Let them in on our society. Men don't have to deal with periods, don't have to worry about whether or not some douchebag splooges in them, don't have to worry about being as physically vulnerable walking alone, don't have to be marginalized as being emotional or as unable to be logical, etc.  Men don't get told they deserve to be raped and fucked up psychologically for a long time if they wear short shorts. Men don't get told that if they pass out, then it should be expected they get fucked. Men don't get told that if they don't report a rape immediately, it didn't happen.   Just knowing that women get a painful, sometimes debilitating, cramping they can't really do much about every month should prompt someone to think maybe it's okay to give a woman a few more sick days.  Maybe it's okay to realize that in divorces, men are more likely to fall into drunken stupors and women are more acclimated to being care-givers so it's okay if we tend to send the kids their way.   &gt;This shit is complex  maybe if you let yourself be indoctrinated with MRA propaganda and shelter yourself off from the real world or constantly deal with shitty women.   I am curious though, all the wealth that was amassed by white men during slavery and when women weren't allowed to work and when minorities were getting cheated on federal housing and such- where do you think it went? You really don't think that the decades and decades and decades of overt, systematic sexism and racism played any part at all in creating today's society?	eat_fruit_not_flesh	t1_dgc2jz7

This is an argument *against* White male privilege, not for it. It is saying that we can not look at a person based on one or two criteria (being white or being poor) and determining his "level of privilege". Each individual has their own history, their own privileges, that they might share or differ with others on.  We are both privileged compared to third world countries in the fact that we have ready access to the internet.  Jaden Smith (don't hate me for this example) is privileged compared to me because he has access to large sums of money and powerful Hollywood connections.

A rich white man (inherited) with a gambling problem can be greatly disadvantaged in society.  A person working in a successful office could be miserable and end up taking his own life while the guy who cleans the toilets for minimum wage could go home happy to his loving wife.

This is his dodge to avoid the unthinkable and his staff and family have to constantly reassure him that people love him, the his rallies are filled with people who love him. He needs to believe that, literally, almost no one dislikes him and that these protests are hired people who love him, but are being paid to say otherwise.  I'm not even being a little bit sarcastic.

It's a different story when those around Trump have courted the Neo-Nazi movement and modelled much of their strategy on Nazi concepts. His chief strategist is the founder of a media group that he called "The foundation of the Alt-Right." Even this article talks about how the administration and their supporters are using the  Nazi word "Lugenpresse" (lying pres) to describe the media.  If they don't want to invite comparisons to Nazi Germany, then they shouldn't model themselves so overtly on Nazi Germany.	The_Original_Gronkie	t1_dgcomst

A common one would be the hand washing sink not being used for hand washing only. But all those meats being held at over forty degrees Fahrenheit is a serious violation in any restaurant. Food temps and cross contamination are serious violations and taken pretty seriously even at a lot of dives. In Florida every restaurant is required to have at least one manager on duty that is certified in food safety. But even just the restaurant workers know that foods must be below forty degrees or above 140 degrees. Mold in the ice machine is an unfortunately common occurrence but it is serious, and gross.   The article, and report, state that corrective action was immediately taken. That would have to include throwing away all foods held at unsafe temps.

It's gross. Raw food stored cooked food in the walk ins. Walk ins that repeatedly break down. So many meats and seafoods held at over 40F temps. Smoked salmon not properly processed (supplier issue). That ice machine. Ick!   Some of the stuff is training issues or something silly like that one guy who rolled a cart in front of the handwashing sink on the one day the health inspector showed up.   But a lot of it seems systemic. Owners who don't give a shit, management who either doesn't give a shit or stopped doing so, workers who aren't trained.   Even when I worked at dives in FL we still knew the laws and cared.   Either way, people should know that they have access to restaurants' health inspection reports.

t3_65td7m	t1_dgd3k96	1492402737	I found the critiques about unsubstantiative change and weathervane politics in West Wing to be particularly flat - at the end of the day it *was* a TV show that had to appeal to the most people possible. Most can agree they want their politicians to act like Bartlett, but once you get into the nitty gritty of policy issues you will lose viewers who either don't agree or aren't interested.  And to say Obama simialrly accomplished nothing of value also seems ludicrous to me - he oversaw the recovery of one of the world's greatest economic meltdowns and is responsible for the ACA, which while imperfect has radically changed the way healthcare works and is perceived, just to name two things.  It finally tries to paint a picture that informed policymaking, respectful discussion, and academic pursuits in general as things that hamper the democratic party. While I agree that the Democrats can afford to 'get in the mud' more (which I think we're seeing now), abandoning those principles entirely would make me and many others leave the party.  3/10 article. Interesting perspective but ultimately unconvincing, kinda insulting, overly pessimistic, and reaching too far to draw it's conclusions.

It began to come under fire around 2012, when a string of lawsuits began to argue that the scheme essentially criminalized poverty by putting people on probation, and, at times, jailing them, solely because of their inability to pay.   So basically not only was it not a loophole, but it was pretty much expected that poor citizens would start getting ripped off by greedy corporations.	dubslies	t1_dgd3rz9

t3_65tqob	t1_dgd5lrl	1492406524	Always good to hear from Pulitzer Prize winner Anne Applebaum who is an expert on Eastern Europe. &gt;  &gt; If Tillerson were a different person and this were a different historical moment, we could forget about this odd dropped comment and move on. But Tillerson has an unusual background for a secretary of state. Unlike everyone who has held the job for at least the past century, he has no experience in diplomacy, politics or the military; instead he has spent his life extracting oil and selling it for profit. At that he was successful. **But no one knows whether he can change his value system to focus instead on the very different task of selling something intangible — American values — to maximize something even more intangible: American influence.** &gt;  &gt; The switch is harder than it seems: **Values and influence cannot be measured like money. They cannot be achieved through cost-cutting or efficiency; they cannot be promoted using the tactics of corporate PR.** On his first trip to Asia, for example, Tillerson refused to take the usual contingent of journalists (who have always paid their own way) on the grounds that if he took fewer people he could use a smaller plane and return faster. If he were still a chief executive, that might have been a great decision. For the secretary of state it was an embarrassing mistake. Authoritarians around the world saw further evidence that the Trump administration intends to undermine journalism; Americans learned less than they should have about a visit that was covered mainly by foreigners. &gt;  &gt; The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea in 2014 were an open attack on the principle of border security in Europe. The principle of border security, in turn, is what turned Europe, once a continent wracked by bloody conflicts, into a safe and peaceful trading alliance in the second half of the 20th century. Europe’s collective decision to abandon aggressive nationalism, open its internal borders and drop its territorial ambitions made Europe rich, as well as peaceful. &gt;  &gt; It also made the United States rich, as well as powerful. U.S. companies do billions of dollars of business in Europe; U.S. leaders have long been able to count on European support all over the world, in matters economic, political, scientific and more. It’s not a perfect alliance but it is an unusual alliance, one that is held together by shared values as well as common interests. If Ukraine, a country of about 43 million people, were permanently affiliated with Europe, it too might become part of this zone of peace, trade and commerce.	therecordcorrected	t3_65tqob

t3_65tov3	t1_dgd63hw	1492407532	The problem with that analysis is that it assumes we would not make it worse. As we've seen in Iraq and Libya, America makes it worse. The US may have noble intentions, but we're basically utter idiots at nation building in the past two decades.   Did Obama's failure to make good on his red line make it worse? Yes. But Pavel assumes that another war in the Middle East could somehow straight out a series of problems that goes back literally hundreds of years. I question the rationality of people who think that's something an outside force not willing to commit complete genocide can do.   Furthermore, what if Obama did go forward with missile strikes almost identical to what Trump did? We've already seen it hasn't stopped Assad and he honestly doesn't care. That requires escalation....which leads to another ground war which no one, no one would have supported. The GOP couldn't even get on board with bombing Muslims. The idea they'd get on board with risking actual lives and spending billions more is completely nuts.

We mostly try to do the right thing and when we don’t, Americans hold their country to account.](www.foreignpolicy.com/2017/02/07/the-slippery-slope-of-trumps-dangerous-whataboutism-russia-putin-american-exceptionalism/)  The basic problem with American ambivalence is that it makes the world a more dangerous place.  Vladimir Putin and his cronies have no objection to violence and no interest in peace beyond the degree to which it is expedient, and so disengagement from Ukraine and the Baltic states only invites further Russian aggression.   The excuse that Tillerson offers; that it’s not the United States’ business to care, reads like a transcript from prior centuries when European powers were carving the world into spheres of influence. The thought was that there would be room enough for all the so-called great powers to exercise their might without intruding upon the others. It was false then as it is now. Their arrogance supposed that by inherent right some nations should dominate others, and that aggressive war was a legitimate tool of diplomacy.  But, because the European powers accepted war as just another transaction between states, their international system was doomed to end in calamity. By tolerating the principle of conquest in some places in hope of detente in others, the Europe neglected the difficult process of building the sort of robust international system that can sustain negotiated settlements. Instead, they favored one that operated on expediency. The tacit agreements and secret alliances that were made to secure temporary power in an ever shifting web of obligation fostered rivalries and distrust which collapsed into disaster on the battlefields of the First World War. Though Gavirio Princip’s assassins were the match which sparked the flame, Europe was already a roiling cauldron of international discontent, and it was made that way by the fact that the powers of the time had gotten used to exercising violence to get their way.  Though the Russian state and their cronies in the Moscow media would spin it otherwise, opposing aggression is not an aggressive act. Sanctions are reactive by nature, and Russia is subject to them by their own design and must endure them only so long as they choose to.  No doubt it would wound his ego to admit it, but Donald Trump must recognize that our rivalry with Russia is not merely political. They have shown active disdain for even the principle of peace. They have lied without fear, because they don’t care if they’re believed. The kleptocratic regime which has taken over their state operates according to principles that are incompatible with the trust that is necessary for the negotiation that Donald Trump prides himself on. What, after all, is the point of concluding treaties and agreements which the other side feels no obligation to honor? Why will appeasement serve us now, when it has always failed in the past?

Borders don't discriminate. People do. Just like people ignore borders for good and nefarious purposes. The good reason to ignore borders is what the EU does. The bad reason to ignore them is to try to annex someone.  You don't want people taking away your freedom for profit just like Ukrainians don't want Russia to just push their way in for oil.

t3_65tqob	t1_dgddtth	1492429408	Oh, goddamit, you have no idea what you are talking about.   Be warned, this is not a response to you, but to the casual lurker.  Borders as lines that define what government controls what land, and by extension the people living on that land, are very important. And keeping those borders secure from encroachment by other government who would seek to control the land behind them and the people living on that land is of paramount importance because that keeps governments/countries from going to war.  On the other hand, when countries use those same borders to inhibit the free flow of ideas, capital and so on - yes, even labour if countries agree to that - is also good.   Why?  Because this contributes to the welfare of the people on all sides of these borders and that, too, reduces the chance of war.  Now, you can disagree on refugee issues and so on, but snide remarks like OP's really only serve to confuse the issue.  For example, in Hillary Clinton's often ridiculed remarks along the lines of dreaming of a day with no borders in the Westerm hemisphere, she meant the latter. A large secure and prosperous trading bloc. NOT anyone can flee to whereever they want.   Again, whether or not governments actually adhere to these ideals is one thing. The powerful ones often step on the toes of the little parnters in such bloc - see Germany in the EU for example.	-14k-	t1_dgdd9ul

t3_65vrqr	t1_dgdmgro	1492442980	It's too early to call it an outlier.  Rasmussen has a significant republican house effect, but if you ignore the top end number and just look at the trendline it's showing a +7 from Trumps lowest approval ratings.  Gallup only shows a +4 during that same time.  If all posters move closer to the +7 side then that's a pretty significant bump.  If it's closer to +4 is likely mostly due to trumps lowest numbers coming after a pretty miserable couple of weeks and those stories dying down lets his numbers recover a bit.	DiogenesKuon	t1_dgdiwk5

t3_65vttf	t1_dgdngxh	1492444137	If he takes 51% he wins out right, but if no one takes above 50, then there's a run-off between the top 2 candidates. The presumption is that if he makes say, 40% and all other Republican candidates split their vote, once the runoff happens there will be only one Republican choice and it will end up (for sake of simplicity) the 40 still voting for Ossoff and 60% for whatever Republican 'won.'  This is not as simple as people make it out to be, since special elections are about *enthusiasm* way more than a regular election is, but just on sheer numbers Ossof has an easier time beating 5 republicans than he does beating 1.	-magic-man	t1_dgdmzy2
t3_65vttf	t1_dgdnulf	1492444568	Right now the Republican vote is split among 4 candidates, weakening their overall position in this first round. If he pulls 51% of the vote he wins. If he doesn't, it goes to a runoff where it will be Ossof vs one Republican (probably Handel). It's extremely unlikely he'll win without a split ticket fragmenting the Republican vote.	myrpfaccount	t1_dgdmzy2

Not gonna happen.  They might fire a couple as a measure of last defense... also a bad idea.  Nukes just aren't that important for war. America has been wagging war's around the world since we first got them and only dropped 2 to stop WW2 (which was on Truman and which I strongly disagree with).  Long story short. Nukes are crap. Non Nuclear tactical arms are worth SO much more. Cruise missiles, the huge cargo carries that act as aerial battleships, drones, hellfire missiles, smart bombs, bunker bombs, etc... (the list goes on and on).  The AK47 has killed 100 times the amount of people than that of any atomic bomb.  No. I don't fear the nukes. I fear a shit ton of armed troops with singer missiles.

t3_660e1x	t1_dgemyyg	1492486423	Restaurant owner here. Also a liberal who supports the raise in minimum wage. I'd like to pay my kitchen crew $15 to $20 an hour while my wait staff that can make up to $250 in tips in a 5 hour shift should be paid way less hourly. We make our front of house tip out all back of house employees which gives them about $1.50 more an hour. My concept is fine food in a casual atmosphere but labor is the main cost. I'm not getting rich or even taking home a middle class income yet. I fully think there should be a lower wage for my servers who make that much in tips. Don't know what the fine details would be but I'd love to pay my kitchen staff enough to eke out a good living. They aren't easily replaceable. Wait staff is.	sturgillskywalker	t3_660e1x

t3_660e1x	t1_dgenjrc	1492487260	Sure, but the point is you can pay your employees more regardless of whether the government raises the minimum wage or not. Unless you play in the NBA I'm not aware of a maximum wage.	gabagool69	t1_dgend10
t3_660e1x	t1_dgenlee	1492487324	Here's the paper abstract. The effect of quality is secondary, in that if you sort by "quality", the effect is larger for "lower quality" for some reasons they note.  Their finding that minimum wage and market exit are directly related isn't reliant on Yelp quality reviews.  &gt; We study the impact of the minimum wage on firm exit in the restaurant industry, exploiting recent changes in the minimum wage at the city level. The evidence suggests that higher minimum wages increase overall exit rates for restaurants. However, lower quality restaurants, which are already closer to the margin of exit, are disproportionately impacted by increases to the minimum wage. Our point estimates suggest that a one dollar increase in the minimum wage leads to a 14 percent increase in the likelihood of exit for a 3.5-star restaurant (which is the median rating), but has no discernible impact for a 5-star restaurant (on a 1 to 5 star scale).

t3_660e1x	t1_dgenr78	1492487555	&gt;The Washington Examiner is a right-wing political journal that goes into the areas you usually expect such publications to go into. It could be thought of as Townhall.com's more "respectable" cousin but even with that being said the site looks like a tabloid desperately trying to pass off as real news. It's not uncommon to see it used as a source among more extreme right-wingers who seem to like how proper the site pretends to be.  &gt;On science issues the site it pretty abysmal. Global warming denialism is rampant, as is myths about DDT bans and other anti-environmentalist rhetoric, leading to the site having a weird obsession with defending coal as being not all that damaging to the environment.

Forcing them to give away money that they earned is an extremely shitty thing to do. This is coming from a chef who made shit wages for a decade before I made decent money. I would be sick to my stomach if I was handed money I didn't earn that was taken from one of my coworkers.  Fuck that.

They handle all their own cash and wrap up all the tips for other employees. I don't see what they tip but I base that on what they claim in tips. I employ 33 people.

Waitstaff have their own set of challenges, sure, and I'm not knocking them... but it's the cooks who do the brunt of the work. The quality and presentation of the food makes me want to tip more, not the service. Good waitstaff know the menu back and forth, understand the needs of the customer, how to up-sell items and make recommendations, and make sure communication between the front of the house and the back goes smoothly and take care of any needs.

t3_661hd6	t1_dgf04r9	1492516611	It's not necessarily the income tax that means that the government owns you...  But the fact that we can't live without paying taxes, that says something.  We owe the government for the right to inhabit the land for services we are "provided," whether we want them or not.  At least half of the nation, if not more, are being "protected against the evils of cannabis" against their will, and being charged by the government for the cost of that enforcement.    We pay for things we use: roads, clean water, electricity, etc. and some of the cost of those things is covered by taxes.  We pay for things that only benefit a few, as well.  The very powerful have figured out how to syphon off some of that sweet government money for their own benefit, reducing the amount available for the public at large, taking a much larger bite than the rest of us can.  But, that's always going to be the case: smart, unscrupulous people will always find a way in any system to game the system to their own advantage.  Me, I pay my income taxes, which are not really so bad, but I also pay tax on things I buy, an amount about equal to my income tax, and I also pay taxes for the privilege of owning the things I have bought, long after I have bought them.  That's three separate bites at the apple, three separate times when I have to pay taxes relative to my earnings.  All told, it adds up to approximately half of what I make.  Then, I'm charged fees to do things like visit national parks, state parks, museums, attend schools, etc. as if I had not already paid for the use of them.  We are cattle, and our activity, our labor, is used to feed the beast that is civilization.  This is a giant pyramid scheme, with a few living at the top, smiling down on the rest of us, happy to watch us work and consume and buy things that they sell.  It has always been this way, and always will.  I'm a happy bovine, off doing my part.  I can do nothing else.	deck_hand	t3_661hd6

t3_660e1x	t1_dgf2feb	1492520605	No, it does not. I don't think there should be *any* minimum wage. Businesses will pay valuable workers more if they want to retain them. If they don't pay enough, those workers will go somewhere else that pays them what they are worth. Businesses should be able to pay disposable workers less. We don't have slave labor in this country. Workers work for a wage under a consensual agreement. If someone wants to wash dishes for $3 an hour because a business can't afford to pay them $10, the government shouldn't step in and tell that person they can't work. The free market already sets a minimum wage. All the government does when it comes in with price floors is create market inefficiencies.	gabagool69	t1_dgeuqca

t3_65ynyz	t1_dgfu1pg	1492551171	&gt; *My apologies for not being able to get to you sooner. I have a life outside of Reddit.*  No worries.  &gt; *You've not cogently articulated any point so I'm not sure what you'd like me to address.*  This is quite a strange thing to say. I'll put the points I've articulated in bullet point form:  * **The Federalist is a bad source**. They have fallen for a meme about journalism that amounts to "anonymous sources === no credibility," when there are actually many valid reasons a journalist might rely on anonymous sources. A credible source wouldn't fall for that. Especially one that has itself relied on... you guessed it... anonymous sources. And no, not some time in the distant past. [Less than two weeks ago](http://thefederalist.com/2017/04/07/sorry-democrats-the-obama-spying-scandal-isnt-going-away/). So, how do you feel about using hypocrites for citations? * **Anonymous sources brought down a president**. Woodward and Bernstein's "Deep Throat" source revealed information about Nixon's White House that ultimately brought it down. * **Journalism schools teach courses on anonymous sources**. Which James F. Kelly should know, given his history. But then, maybe not... His background is in curating databases of information, not in journalism. His [bio](http://thefederalist.com/author/jameskelly/) at The Federalist is very vague about it. (Side note: It's also incredibly clumsily written, and contains an amateur-hour typo. Why in the world do you think this guy's credible?)  &gt; *And I'd like to know if you consider all conservative sources to be invalid because if you do then you should move back into the echo chamber where you're more comfortable and safe from people like me who will challenge you.*  So I went back and looked at our entire conversation, looking for any sign I had said anything like "all conservative sources are invalid." [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/65ynyz/when_will_the_media_realize_that_anonymous/dgesuqs/) is my first comment on this thread regarding anonymous sources. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/65ynyz/when_will_the_media_realize_that_anonymous/dgf2zzk/) is my second. [Third](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/65ynyz/when_will_the_media_realize_that_anonymous/dgf533y/). And [fourth](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/65ynyz/when_will_the_media_realize_that_anonymous/dgf66ez/), which you just responded to. Nowhere in any of those comments does the word "conservative" - or even "republican" - appear. You are reading something into my comments that is quite literally absent. Nevertheless, I'm happy to respond and explain my stance regarding what I consider to be legitimate sources, left- or right-leaning, just as soon as we wrap up the topics in my list above.	kescusay	t1_dgfqvsk

t3_6631mg	t1_dgfw89l	1492553766	&gt; Do you think your average joe americaman has the institutional knowledge to identify which individual line item in an agency budget is 'wasteful' or 'beneficial'?   If you are smart enough to get a good job and pay 30K-50K in taxes, then you are smart enough to identify where your taxes should go to. If your "average joe" lacks education, works few hours for minimum wage and pays little to no taxes, then it honestly doesn't matter whether he understands the budget or doesn't.   &gt; Government spends lots of money on non-visible things that need funding that your average person has no idea about or doesn't understand the value of.   Those "non-visible things" are most probably the things that don't need funding. People deserve government transparency.	erxxo	t1_dgf9bbd

t3_6631mg	t1_dgfxa95	1492555062	In fact I should be laughing over your comment. It's funny how you flipped and changed your "non-visible things" to "things that aren't popular".

t3_6631mg	t1_dgfxs27	1492555687	Non-visible is pretty much the same as non-popular. That are loads of budgetary line items and spending by agencies that look stupid if you don't have context.

t3_6674ir	t1_dggduex	1492575283	Hello! I am an economist and currently running a business consulting firm based in Florida, where I have seen the sort of problems you're facing first hand. Namely, despite consumer confidence being up, fewer people are willing to splurge on bigger purchases. Secondly, as interest rates continue to rise very slowly, there's some slight give and take to the stock market, which changes those investments into savings (there is a reason why, when measuring this, savings equal investments).  Thirdly, much of our economy relies on trade. Upwards of 5~6 million people rely on imports, and many more on exports, and a general malaise settles in businesses that are afraid. This malaise is passed to the employees, who are also consumers, and  to business partners, clients, and on and on.  People still don't know exactly where this country is heading because the American ship is currently rudderless or, at the least, the captain pays more attention to Fox News and faking his golfing scores than he does the rudder.  All of this spells one thing: uncertainty. In uncertain times, savings rise, investment falls (remember: mostly the same thing) and spending falls.  So either people are expecting car prices to drop dramatically because of "magic deregulation that will totally do that, no really guys, why are you laughing," or people are expecting another hard crash, and buying a car today means maybe no home tomorrow. It doesn't matter much which, they have the same effect.	ChaoticGoodEconomics	t1_dggccy3
t3_6674ir	t1_dggdxgg	1492575410	True, I was trying to differentiate non car durable goods and whiffed.

t3_65ynyz	t1_dggerv3	1492576708	If it will help move this conversation forward, which is what I'd like, I'll answer. No, of course not. News is news, facts don't have a political bias left or right, and as long as a source abides by well-established standards of journalism, I don't give a damn what its editorial board's political leanings are.  Here are the questions I have regarding any news source, left, right, up, down, or whatever:  1. **Does it have an identifiable editorial board?** This is important because when a source you've never heard of comes your way, and you're trying to assess whether or not it's legitimate, knowing who is in charge helps. Is it operated by experienced journalists? Or is it some fly-by-night bullshit purveyor, with no identifiable editors? 2. **Does it clearly identify opinion pieces?** It's fine to have deeply editorialized content as long as it's clearly identified as such. No one reads a Paul Krugman piece and mistakes his very liberal economic opinions as unbiased news. 3. **Does it have a corrections policy?** This one's a no-brainer; if a news source doesn't have a policy for correcting stories as new information becomes available or as human errors are discovered, then it's not really a news source and isn't worthwhile. Sure, it might get something right now and then, but it's clearly not reliable, and should be replaced with a better source. 4. **Does its staff include actual reporters?** Another no-brainer; if a source doesn't ever actually engage in information-gathering in the field, it's not news. At best, it's something like a Reuters/AP reprint service, and at worst, it's just making things up.  Meet those four criteria and have a reputation for being accurate? Then I don't give a damn what your political biases are. You qualify as a legitimate news source. Fail to meet those criteria? Then I'm going to second-guess anything I hear from you, even if you're super liberal.  The Federalist fails on points 2, 3, and 4. To their credit, they have an identifiable board, but they don't have reporters, don't firmly delineate between news and opinion, and good luck finding a corrections policy.  Now then... I feel I've *thoroughly* answered your question. Will you finally do me the favor of addressing my points?	kescusay	t1_dggdoh9
t3_667z0h	t1_dggetop	1492576790	No, it is very much in character as you say. But just an odd thing to be upset over. He really doesn't seem all right in the head.	TaylorSwyft	t1_dggeqo0

t3_6674ir	t1_dggew1m	1492576896	Interest rates must be tied to the health of the economy. We are exiting a time of 'highly accomodative monetary policy' http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accomodativemonetarypolicy.asp  Interest rates have been insanely low for a long time because of the craziness that came from the mortgage crisis. As the economy slowly improved, interest rates were kept low in order to not derail the improvement.  The Fed is responsible for setting interest rates. They have been saying for a very long time that they would start to increase interest rates (get them back to normal) once the GDP and employment data met certain targets. Which has finally happened.  Interest rates as low as they've been are a sign of a sick economy. No on should want to see them this low.	BlueSkyToday	t3_6674ir

I don't think that it's necessarily untrue or not a factor. I just think it's as idiotic to reflexively proscribe it to a president I don't politically care for as it is for him to take credit for economic policies that were clearly implemented during Obama's tenure.	420is404	t1_dggey07

If you take Ossoff's margin over Hillary's in DeKalb county, which finished counting relatively early, then apply that same margin to the other two counties, you can get a pretty accurate estimate of the overall vote. Ossoff outperformed Hillary by 1.6%, 1.5%, and 1.4% within the three counties of this district (with a bit of Fulton still uncounted).

t3_668gx4	t1_dggkyx9	1492591135	This is an incredible book on this exact subject. The author worked in the heart of the propaganda machine and was responsible for coming up with the stupid, mythological stories about the amazing feats of the Dear Leader that are taught to North Korean kids as fact. He knew it was all nonsense but his life was relatively great so it wasn't in his interest to rebel. He did start to doubt the regime though, inevitably, and eventually escaped.   I read this book in about two sittings - I couldn't put it down, it's so gripping! What was incredibly fascinating was how he explained the ascent of Kim Jung-il, the son of Kim il-Sung. Kim Jung-il hated his father and wasn't actually chosen to succeed Kim il-Sung, as it's commonly believed. Kim Jung-il orchestrated a power grab before his father's death using his relatively low-level job in the propaganda office. In his job, he realised the true potential of propaganda and how it could be used to manipulate and control. He used his position to control the flow of information to his father before eventually cutting him off completely. This allowed him to set up an alternative centre of power around himself, the real power, alongside the pretend power of his father. Fascinating stuff.    https://www.amazon.com/Dear-Leader-Escape-North-Korea/dp/1476766568/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1492589026&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Dear+Leader%3A+My+Escape+from+North+Korea	Comrade0gilvy	t1_dggi0pq

We wouldn't have wanted Malia Obama being kidnapped with Obama having to make decisions that are best for the country but could kill his daughter. We don't want Trump making the same decisions. The point is that when you are President of the United States you have to make major sacrifices.   It's not an easy job. You and your family are going to have to make major changes. When you decide to run for President it means you and your family are going to have to change your lives.

Well, with the money he raised for his first election he was able to find stupid and vulnerable people and target them with ads containing lies crafted so they would fall for them; which in turn swayed votes which won him the election.   Once in power he freed up ISPs to fuck people by selling their data, he freed up companies to pollute, he relaxed rules on financial institutions so they don't have to offer their customers the best deal for the customer...

I blame rap music FOR that. People seemingly overlook rap music turning a hateful word that was primarily regulated to the south and some of the seedier people in life, into a word that has ambiquitous meanings and all depends on context.  My father was what I like to call a half-racist. He wasn't all about hanging the blacks, but he wasn't going to offer them a hand either. He'd drop the N bomb once and a while, always in a negative way. I know I learned the word from him, but I didn't really have it in my vocabulary.  Enter Dr. Dre into my life. My friends, my enemies, random people on the street, became N words. It's taken me a long time to ween that cultural influence from my vocabulary and I still drop them from time to time, but I didn't get that habit from my half racist dad, I got it from rap music abusing the shit out of it.   I understand the word has its meanings, but that was not the way I was raised in using it. It wasn't repeated over and over again as a derogatory term for a certain group of people in a negative context, it was used as a description of everything from enemy to friend. Rap turned it from a completely racist term into something with context. I applaud that effect, but I have a hard time accepting anyone saying the word is only a racist term when there are the last 40 years of rap music literally singing otherwise.  You can be offended, but just think how less than 60 years ago the only context for that word was straight up racism. Now, it isn't necessarily so.  I don't think Nazis are ever going to get that luxury.	dtabitt	t1_dggrixv

The total difference between Total Dem and Total Repub was 4,086 which is right at the 2% margin.     So this is far from over.    With Gray out of the race I'm optimistic.  He was very Pro-Trump and endorsed by Trump too.   His share of the votes were 10.8% (~21k).   If his supporters aren't on board with Karen Handle (there's good evidence to suggest she can't capture them all), then Ossoff can pull this off.

Never mind that its use by black society has often been regarded as "taking back" the word, which is why you feel comfortable with it.  Rap music is insanely popular. Plenty of listeners dont drop N-bombs. Besides, you think THIS guy is listening to a lot of rap these days? Are violent video games to blame for violence?  I get what you're saying, but it's still something that is the responsibility of you to control. You shouldn't feel comfortable saying it just because the rappers you listen to do. It may be less racist today, but it still hurts.	Mr_Diggums	t1_dggtrmc

In this case however, the big deal isn't that she was in a river, but that she was a "trailblazing judge" who died under less than average circumstances.

We’re hoping if anyone could shed any light into the hours before her disappearance, it would help us establish what happened.”  ...  &gt;**Her death was initially described as a suspected suicide**, and there were no signs of forced entry at her home.

We have to start trying in places like Kansas and Georgia if we are ever going to be able to flip seats, we have to start trying in places where republican policies have not helped or even made their situations worse.  We have to start mobilizing in these states, not necessarily reach out, but at least get those who don't vote that would vote blue tk actually fucking vote.  Your attitude is a losing attitude, and it is what will lead us to 8 years of trump not 4.	spawberries	t1_dggzita

t3_66akl4	t1_dgh0nyo	1492617230	Yeah, I'm guessing something like ruling suicide or accident as the cause of death would make this a reasonable time for the police to release a statement; after all at some point in the near future they may be asking the public for help.

Do it locally as well as nationally. The status quo is ceding too much of the policy discussion to the extremes shouting "open borders" and "single payer now."

It is just getting crazy because it seems like people are writing articles about how Trump shits the wrong way and how that offends them.   It is frustrating that 95% of the criticism in the MSM did not exist for Obama like it does for Trump, when the policies of one line-up with the other on certain aspects.  Under Obama a record number of illegal aliens were deported, moreso than any President before him, but the MSM was quiet. Obama ran a drone war on the entire Middle East, but the MSM was quiet.

This article praises Obama while tearing down Trump for the same action.  This subreddit is an echochamber because of this.  Your second post:  1. The media didn't criticize Obama like it did Trump.  Trump is getting criticized for things that the media ignored.  Can you see the difference between your two posts?    The MSM wasn't quiet, but it wasn't nearly as loud as it was now (kind of like Captain America before and after his transformation lol).  That being said, a lot of this is Trump's doing.  Obama didn't constantly attack the media as fake and pump out lies.  Trump used the media hype machine to get elected, and it has caught up to him.  Trump is also failing pretty hard at being president, he is extremely unqualified for the job.  I doubt you'd see the media outcry you see now if it was president McCain or Romney.  Last, there were multiple channels and tons of MSM dedicated to attacking Obama 24/7, so it's pretty hard to pretend as though he didn't get it to some extent as well.	MissionStyle	t1_dgh4118

And one state cannot unilaterally decide what constitutes a violation of international law unless it has sufficient force to impose its will on others who challenge such an interpretation. America's comparative power advantage with the rest of world has fallen sufficiently since Iraq that it no longer gets to decide what is and isn't a violation of international law. Now that China and Russia are backing Assad's use of chemical weapons, the Geneva Protocols are *de facto* unenforceable.	doubleplusuntruth	t1_dgh2t2g

t3_669spd	t1_dgh5fd6	1492622175	No need to jump at the person the way you did, though. I'm willing to bet if you simply told the person that referring to it as "half-racism" is wrong because it implies that it's OK, the person would have explained that they don't believe it's OK at all. And that their father's racism is awful, but that he was trying to distinguish between malicious hatred racism (which does exist) and simply being an asshole. Sure, they're both completely awful, but distinguishable.   The person who made the original comment is DEFINITELY not racist because of their comment though. And saying so is completely unfair to them. It's not him "finding it acceptable designation" that's YOU inferring that he finds it an "acceptable designation" he simply used the term to distinguish between what people's initial thought is at the word "racism". His term to make that distinction is bad, but that's what he was going for.   All the same, I don't want to get into this any further, so inbox replies are off. I'm just letting you know so that you don't spend a ton of time crafting a response (and I appreciate your time, sincerely).

t3_66bg2l	t1_dgh5n2r	1492622396	Except that the majority of the judges are expressing sympathy to the Church. It's going to go in favor of the church, I have no doubt anymore. It's just a matter of how much in favor of the church the ruling will go. The arguments are absurd, but are being made nonetheless. Unless the argument is made (and supported by most justices) that the church would use those funds to discriminate based upon religion, i cannot see them ruling in favor of the state.  Church: Kagan (D), Alito (R), Roberts (R), Gorsuch (R)  Leaning Church: Breyer (D)   State: Sotomeyer (D), Ginsberg (D)  &gt; “You’re denying one set of actors because of their religion,” Justice Elena Kagan told a lawyer for the state. In such a case, she said, the state’s interests “have to rise to an extremely high level.” (D)  &gt;Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was a tough questioner of Layton, and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. pointed out a number of federal programs that allowed government funding for safety and protection of churches, synagogues and mosques. (R+R)  &gt;Gorsuch said the one thing that everyone in the case agrees upon is that the church was subject to discrimination by being told it could not participate in the program, which reimburses those who resurface their playgrounds through a state program that recycles old tires. (R)  &gt;Stephen G. Breyer, seemed sympathetic to the church. If Missouri’s prohibition was taken further, he said, it could refuse to provide police and fire protection to churches, he said. (D)  Sotomeyer and Ginsberg seems to side with the state.  Thomas (R) and Kennedy (R) were not mentioned in either article.

They were also particularly motivated by precepts of religious thought at the time that emphasized, to some extent, liberty, self-determination, and individual enterprise.   What is actually interesting is that current generations of politicians are so amazingly quick to ignore these basic concepts and be persuaded to ignore the overall well-being of our nation in return for financial and status improvements.

That's just way too reactionary and broad for me. Churches are still part of the city/community/state and if the government has appropriated funds to better *x*, then I don't see why churches can't even be held under consideration.

t3_66bg2l	t1_dgh6q0c	1492623526	I think not qualifying for grants is just part of the tradeoff for not having to pay taxes.  Churches are in their own category and the state decided they didn't have to pay taxes, but also couldn't recieve state funds.  Seems perfectly fair to me.

t3_66bg2l	t1_dgh6sy2	1492623611	The one that confuses me the most is Kagan's statement about denying based upon religion. Being denied due to existence of religious affiliation is not the same as being denied due to a *specific* religious affiliation as far as I know, yet she calls them essentially the same thing. Perhaps she is trying to move towards the idea that if this church is approved, then all must be, therefore it would create an enormous burden on the state which would meet her second requirement.

t3_66bg2l	t1_dgh6sz7	1492623612	Also, they don't have to follow most anti-discrimination laws.  If churches want to be treated like public institutions, they will have to act like them....	ivsciguy	t1_dgh6q0c

They're both billionaire real-estate guys in the Northeast, it would actually be weirder if Kraft and Trump didn't know each other.  &gt;and now lovable defenseman.   "defenseman" is not a football position. Also, Gronk plays Tight End, which is on the offensive side of the Ball. You...don't actually watch football, do you?  &gt; Football as a whole is tainted so long as Kaepernick can't get signed.

t3_66akl4	t1_dgh92qr	1492625973	Yeah ,context is important.

Through no fault of Gronk, this was just a massively unprofessional display. It highlights the fact that the white house doesn't take transparency seriously when it can't even conduct a press conference without blatant lies and silly shenanigans. Spicer frequently laughs at the absurdity of the role he plays with the press, and the combative relationship they have. It seems light hearted, but it was really just sad.

Maybe because those policies don't match up as close as you think they do. The manner in which things are done matters.  &gt;Under Obama a record number of illegal aliens were deported, moreso than any President before him, but the MSM was quiet. Obama ran a drone war on the entire Middle East, but the MSM was quiet.   First, no they weren't. That's a false narrative your conservative media has feed you.  Second, do you understand that Obama was prioritizing actual criminals? Or that Obama provided a path to citizenship for illegals brought here as children with no say in the matter? And that Trump isn't prioritizing criminals? And that he's deporting people who voluntarily came forward to attempt a path to citizenship?   Or that Obama required administration oversight on drone use? That the military would have to get approval each and every time? And how under Trump they don't?   A hurricane and a spring shower both get the ground wet, should the weatherman report on those the same? Doing so would be creating a false equivalence.   Claimimg Trump and Obama are the same on deportations and drone strikes is also a false equivalence. &gt; &gt;These people who will lambast Trump for these policies will ignore or feign ignorance on the same things Obama did. My frustration lies in the clear bias and hypocrisy of the media tbh, not against either man. &gt;   Then your frustration lies with Trump. The media hasn't treated past Republicans like this. Past Republicans haven't attacked the media. When Carl Bernstein sits on the Steele Dossier for months, then reports Senator McCain delivered it to the FBI. In response, Trump calls it "fake news." Senator McCain confirms it, FBI Director Comey confirms it, and Trump continues to push his claim of "fake news."  As Mark Twain said, 'Don't start arguments with people who buy ink by the barrel'  Trump started a fight with people who buy ink by the barrel.	bluemandan	t1_dgh4118

Now the left wants to go for broke.  &gt;The internecine dispute over where to play could last well beyond this season of special elections and into the 2018 midterm elections. At issue is whether the campaign arm of the House Democrats and the Democratic National Committee should dedicate money and staff to campaigns that may appear to be a reach but that could still galvanize small-dollar donors and activists hungry to compete.  &gt;...  &gt;But that is not the case in Montana, where a preference for Republican presidential candidates belies its enduring Democratic tradition. Its governor, Steve Bullock, is a Democrat. One of its senators, Jon Tester, is a Democrat. And now its one House seat is vacant.	Lemon_Lyman_	t3_66cnov

I don't think the hate aspect will ever fully go away, but I think the attitude of non-blacks using it is going to shrink mightly because it's been so overused and jammed into cultural thanks to rap.

t3_66d2lu	t1_dghmfhu	1492640305	Eventually is not fast enough for me.   Today, Maddow discovered another blatant lie. After an alleged CENTCOM spokesperson issued a very unprofessional press release on 04/13/17,  CENTCOM supposedly issued a *real* press release informing the press the initial statement was not made by an official CENTCOM spokesperson. Maddow's show received this "official" CENTCOM release, numbered 20170414-1. But it gets better.   The new press release that was sent to journalists informing them the initial press release was not authorized by CENTCOM does seem to exist.  https://imgur.com/a/M4475  You can read the press releases on the military's website.  http://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/  Each document has a release number. The release number of the document asserting it was walking back the faux release was, as previously noted, #20170414-1.  However, the document with that release number posted on CENTCOM is actually a press release informing the media of military action in the Middle East.   &gt; Military airstrikes continue against ISIS terrorists in Syria and Iraq"   20170414-1 does not address the first unauthorized alleged CENTCOM press release, which begs two serious questions;  * Can we trust anything coming from the Trump Administration?   * Can we trust our military?	knowjustice	t1_dghig97

I'm not gonna be able to convince you with some clever message but I'll just say this, things are more complicated than that. We call ourselves capitalist but we do some socialist things, other things grabbed from other political models, etc. Venezuela saw like 50 years of "capitalism" where the rich politicians robbed the country blind... but there was a surprisingly strong middle class. Then in early 90s comes an army colonel talking about rising up, gets sent to jail after failed coup, and when gets released he gets elected by popular vote. Then his people take over and they build some roads and other basic services in areas that had never seen even clinics except they continue to rob the country blind just like the past administration. Except these time all the friends they put in government positions are ignorant idiots that don't know how to govern so little by little parts of industry or the State start to break down but instead of being voted out, they change the rules or other ways to always stay in power including murdering the opposition. You can call that dictatorship, communism, corrupt capitalism, doesn't matter, it's thugs taking over a State that had a lot of resources and then doing whatever they want. I understand they call themselves a socialist state and it pains me to know it will tarnish people's perception of socialism for a long time.	Fhquijan	t1_dghp9z1

t3_66dnnw	t1_dghrfd1	1492646551	&gt; silence political opponents  She isn't being silenced, there is no law being passed that prevents her from speaking, or censors her work.  She is being denied the privilege of speaking live in one specific place and time. Students there can still stream her videos, read her books, and chat with her online.   They could also go a few miles down the road and hire a private venue for her to speak at.    You don't see Bill Maher crying about his rights being violated when he isn't allowed to speak at Liberty University, and Michael Moore doesn't cry "but muh free speech" when he isn't given a prime time speaking slot at the NRA Convention.  It's the equivalent of banning a noxious troll from this subreddit, the majority would breathe a sigh of relief, a few others would cry about freeze peaches, and the troll would continue *not being silenced* because they would immediately start speaking somewhere else.  When jackbooted thugs beat down Ann Coulter's door and arrest her for political dissent, or Congress passes a "**S**ilence **A**nn **C**oulter **U**nder **P**ressure" law then you can complain about silencing political opponents, but preventing a troll from possibly inciting a riot is definitely not silencing a political opponent.	not_a_persona	t1_dghpold

The question is whether they "owe her a platform."  The answer is, yes, they do owe her a platform.	CEvonk	t1_dgho6zy
t3_66dnnw	t1_dghttkw	1492649557	No, actually, they do owe her a platform.  UCB is public property, thus it is governed by the free speech laws that apply to public property.  UCB has allowed others to speak on their property. They cannot refuse her the same.  If they have public safety concerns, they should address the issue of public safety (hire more security), rather than squelching free speech.	CEvonk	t1_dgho1lm
t3_66dnnw	t1_dghtwqq	1492649660	Yes, exactly!  And whatever permission has been extended to others to speak on that public property must be extended to *all* to speak on that property.  Since they have allowed other speakers to use their soapbox, they may not disallow Ann Coulter's use of their soapbox.	CEvonk	t1_dghnve0
t3_66dnnw	t1_dghu0jv	1492649791	If what she says has nothing to do with it, then her speech is not the issue.  Since it's a public safety issue, as you claim, the proper response would be for the university to ensure public safety so that the speech could take place.	CEvonk	t1_dghq6b2

t3_66dnnw	t1_dghug0i	1492650307	The school is public property, government property.  Basic constitutional law requires that if an public speaking, is permitted on specific government property, then *everyone* is entitled to use the property for that purpose.	CEvonk	t1_dghnlyu

Her best course of action would be a legal action against the school for violating her right to free speech.	CEvonk	t1_dghne4u
t3_66dnnw	t1_dghut4x	1492650757	&gt; Free speech doesn't mean that people have to allow it--only that the government can't forbid it.   You are correct.  However, UCB *is* the government in this case, and they have allowed others to use their facility for speaking, so they *must* allow Ann Coulter the same opportunity, otherwise the government is forbidding free speech.  It is a false sense of privilege -- because it is a constitutional *right,* and *not* a privilege.	CEvonk	t1_dgho3vr

They did not pass a law to keep her from speaking, so there is no constitutional issue.   There are limits to free speech and limits to use of public property. UCB said they had to cancel the speech due to safety concerns. I see no problems since the fringe of both sides have said they would fight and recent events have shown the consequences of having such an event.	TheBraveSirRobin	t1_dghu2b5

Go try it at your local court house and see how it goes.  That's true.  You could not do this *inside* a courthouse because no judge allows that kind of thing. However, if the courthouse were in the habit of allowing people to stand on a soapbox and rant until they were blue in the face in the front yard of the courthouse, then the courthouse could not stop one particular person from exercising his or her free speech rights in that manner.  Some public property is off limits to almost public uses:  military bases, the White House, the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center.  Nobody is allowed to get up on a soapbox in these spaces.  Other public property is regularly used for free speech by the public:  public parks, public streets (you can have a parade with a permit), public sidewalks.  Schools that allow community groups to meet on their campuses are a common example of public use of public property, and where this is permitted for some, it cannot be denied to any -- because they have a *right* "to set up and have a speech there."  This is basic US constitutional law.	CEvonk	t1_dghujq8

So, the school gets to make a statement (speak) by quashing Ann Coulter's speech, but Ann Coulter does not get to speak.

I suggest a course in Constitutional Law, both semesters, to gain a fuller understanding of the issue.  UCB is a government entity that has the legal authority to make and enforce rules regarding the use of its property, public property.  That gives its rulings the color of law, whether a statute has been passed or not.  Ann Coulter is trying to assemble peaceably with her sponsoring group so that she can give a speech.  She is not breaking any laws by doing so.  What people outside do is not her fault.  There are limits to free speech and limits to the use of public property.  The government is very limited in its ability to regulate the free speech of one person on public property when it has allowed other people to exercise the right to free speech on the very same property.  Ann Coulter is the guest of a campus group, not a "side."  Ann Coulter is only responsible for her own behavior, not the behavior of "fringe groups."	CEvonk	t1_dghvac6

"The Lantana owners are pushing compromises they say will ensure Trump's security while keeping their businesses open.

Pilots, planes and cargo would undergo preflight screening by Transportation Security Administration agents."

There would be no imperative for a ball game.^* There is likewise no imperative for an entertainer. Coulter describes herself as an entertainer. Why is cancelling a performance by an entertainer because of undisputed threats of violence by outside forces (several of them at that), which further have been proven by recent events not to be empty, exclusively viewed as an attack on free speech against the entertainer rather than the obvious risk to public safety that it is?   We're just not going to see eye-to-eye on this. If you don't start with the idea that Coulter is being censored here there is no argument. If it were a rock show it would be cancelled. Why is this entertainer different, or should we suddenly start examining the qualities of the content being produced?   I am not going to start with the basic principle that the entertainer is being censured by the state. I am starting with the premise that a dangerous situation is being avoided, faulting on the side of safety.   I don't believe the University is taking this action because of the specific content of the entertainer. I think they are doing this because of public credible threats against public safety and order. The entertainer is simply out of luck.   ---  ^* of note during the Baltimore riots an Orioles game, several days delayed, ended up winning the imperative argument and did get  played in Camden Yards.

The issue isn't the no fly zone and the protection of the President. The issue is that the President takes his expensife trips so often that it's causing people to lose their jobs caused by the no fly zones.

t3_66dnnw	t1_dgi3fyt	1492661747	Your 'color of law' argument does not hold water. The university cancelled the speech due to active security threats. They are not making any moves to stifle free speech; they are trying to protect the students, speakers and public property. Both school administration and law enforcement are saying that they don't think that they could sufficiently protect Coulter or the students at this time. The school administration wants to move the event to a later date; this shows that she was not banned from speaking at the school.    In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District (1969), the SCOTUS said First Amendment guarantees must be balanced against a school's need to keep order. The "disruption test" is frequently-cited precedent...    &gt; Under our Constitution, free speech is not a right that is given only to be so circumscribed that it exists in principle but not in fact. Freedom of expression would not truly exist if the right could be exercised only in an area that a benevolent government has provided as a safe haven for crackpots. The Constitution says that Congress (and the States) may not abridge the right to free speech. This provision means what it says. We properly read it to **permit reasonable regulation of speech-connected activities in carefully restricted circumstances**. But we do not confine the permissible exercise of First Amendment rights to a telephone booth or the four corners of a pamphlet, or to supervised and ordained discussion in a school classroom.    &gt; If a regulation were adopted by school officials forbidding discussion of the Vietnam conflict, or the expression by any student of opposition to it anywhere on school property except as part of a prescribed classroom exercise, it would be obvious that the regulation would violate the constitutional rights of students, at least if it could not be justified by a showing that the students' **activities would materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school**. Cf. Hammond [514] v. South Carolina State College, 272 F.Supp. 947 (D. C. S. C. 1967) (orderly protest meeting on state college campus); Dickey v. Alabama State Board of Education, 273 F.Supp. 613 (D. C. M. D. Ala. 1967) (expulsion of student editor of college newspaper). In the circumstances of the present case, the prohibition of the silent, passive "witness of the armbands," as one of the children called it, is no less offensive to the Constitution's guarantees.    &gt; **As we have discussed, the record does not demonstrate any facts which might reasonably have led school authorities to forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities, and no disturbances or disorders on the school premises in fact occurred**. These petitioners merely went about their ordained rounds in school. Their deviation consisted only in wearing on their sleeve a band of black cloth, not more than two inches wide. They wore it to exhibit their disapproval of the Vietnam hostilities and their advocacy of a truce, to make their views known, and, by their example, to influence others to adopt them. They neither interrupted school activities nor sought to intrude in the school affairs or the lives of others. They caused discussion outside of the classrooms, but **no interference with work and no disorder**. In the circumstances, our Constitution does not permit officials of the State to deny their form of expression.    The students won in Tinker v. Des Moines simply because there was no disruption. If Coulter does go and have her speech, as she has promised in interviews, then there will be protests and violence is likely.

t3_66fas7	t1_dgi3ygn	1492662561	My point is this has to be the first time I've actually seen hate crime charges put towards people for just burning a sign. We've had 8 years of far worse shit by the Right, and haven't seen hate crime charges unless they blatantly were doing shit like painting the N-word across an Obama campaign office or something similar.   The other charges of arson and malicious destruction of property fit perfectly, and likely hold higher penalties. The article doesn't go into any real substance on why hate crime charges were added, yet that is all that is mentioned in the title.   But hey, it's the NY Post. They need to trigger their audience to the reverse racism narrative over more pressing charges like arson and destruction of property in this case.	Down-Syndrome-Danny-	t1_dgi2l36

t3_66dnnw	t1_dgi5lfh	1492665350	I think you are confusing some issues.  The school is acting under color of law, exactly as I claimed.  No legislation must be passed specific to Ann Coulter's appearance in order for the school's actions to be taken under color of law.  The school is a government agency.  *Tinker* has no relevance to that question.  Because the school has created a public forum by allowing other speakers to speak, they do "owe her a platform," (despite dr_pepper_35's comment to the contrary.)  So, she has a right to speak, and to say whatever she legally can.  The school is blaming her *presence* (which is a form of speech) for the potential disorder on the street, and punishing her for the *potential* actions of others by denying her the right to speak.  That is content based discrimination.  Of course, your response is that they are moving the date for safety reasons; however, what date are they moving it to?  When is a date on which they can guarantee that no one will violently protest her presence?  4:00 AM on a Monday?  Christmas morning at 5:30 AM?  Moving the date to an inconvenient time for protestors would likely mean moving it to an inconvenient time for students who wish to attend, which would be an unconstitutional infringement of her right to speak in a public forum.  What if violent protestors show up on the date to which they move the event?  I think you are reading *Tinker* incorrectly.  The Court found that repression of speech could be justified "if it could not be justified by a showing that **the students' activities** would materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school."  The Court goes on to say that "**[t]hey** caused discussion outside of the classrooms, but [**they caused**] no interference with work and no disorder."  The Court addressed what the *students* did, not what completely unrelated people on the street did.  The Court focused on the actions of *the students* because it was *the students* speech rights that were targeted.  I think that the proper response is for the civil authorities to maintain order so that the university does not feel a need to stifle free speech based on its content simply because other people are going to behave badly.  If the civil authorities maintained order, then the school would not feel a need to act.  Letting thugs force the stifling of free speech because it is the expedient thing to do seems to be a very slippery slope toward no speech.	CEvonk	t1_dgi3fyt
t3_66dnnw	t1_dgi65jl	1492666436	First off, throw your slippery slope arguments in the trash where they belong.    Second, show me specifically in the California Education Code Section 89030.1 where 'color of law' is referenced and how that fits this case.    Third, it is a student group that has invited Coulter to speak at UCB, so this is a student activity and Tinker fits.	TheBraveSirRobin	t1_dgi5lfh

By allowing states to opt out of this, nothing else matters as insurance companies can raise rates based on individuals conditions, therefore price the people they don't want out of their market.   This is insurance for the healthy, screw the sick.  Example:  It says the "pre-existing condition" clause stays in, but this let's them price you at a gazillion dollars for having a pre-exiting condition effectively making that clause worthless.	yeaabut	t3_66hvdb

t3_66dnnw	t1_dgilma0	1492699075	&gt; So, next time someone comes to speak people can threaten violence to stop the speaker, and you're okay with that.    Threatening violence is against the law, so no I'm not okay with it, but I am okay with rescheduling an event as a safety measure.    &gt; You need to learn what color of law means before you start arguing about it    So I get it, you cant answer point two. I do understand 'color of law', but in this instance they are not making/bending any laws nor are they depriving Coulter of any Constitutional rights. The school is offering to reschedule the event at a later date when administrators and law enforcement think they will be able to safely have this speech.    &gt; Yes, it is a student activity    Hey you admit it is a student activity that would likely cause disruption.    &gt; Tinker was about students causing disruption    That is not 100% true; Tinker is about student's actions causing a disruption. The students in Tinker only wore a black armband, not disruptive in itself. The fear was that there would be a disruption from people other than the ones wearing the armbands.    &gt; ...but the students' activity is not what is causing the danger ... Tinker was about students causing disruption, not thugs coming from the hinterlands.    Again this fits Tinker. On a side note, do you honestly think no students would be involved with the protests and violence surrounding such an event? You'd have to be awfully ignorant to believe no students would be involved after the recent incidents.	TheBraveSirRobin	t1_dgihj7z

t3_66hxw0	t1_dgilqw4	1492699222	&gt; The label of fake news is appropriate  No, it isn't. This meeting actually happened. Is it sensationalist? Absolutely. Is it masturbatory and unnecessary? Yes.  But "fake news" is a label that should be reserved for actual fake news. If the story was "Trump met with Ted Nugent and appoints him as the new head of the ATF," it would be fake.  I agree with you that it's a non-story and is taking up space that would be better served with actual news.

So would this be under the Constitution or the War Powers Act or what?   I see this when I looked up the War Powers Resolution in regards to Libya  &gt; Months later, she stated that, with respect to the military operation in Libya, the United States was still flying a quarter of the sorties, and the New York Times reported that, while many presidents had bypassed other sections of the War Powers Resolution, there was little precedent for exceeding the 60-day statutory limit on unauthorized military actions – a limit which the Justice Department had said in 1980 was constitutional On Friday, June 3, 2011, the US House of Representatives voted to rebuke President Obama for maintaining an American presence in the NATO operations in Libya, which they considered a violation of the War Powers Resolution. In The New York Times, an opinion piece by Yale Law Professor Bruce Ackerman stated that Obama's position "lacks a solid legal foundation. And by adopting it, the White House has shattered the traditional legal process the executive branch has developed to sustain the rule of law over the past 75 years."  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution#Libya_intervention_in_2011   Cmon man, give me SOMETHING to work with here, I'm trying.

t3_66b30m	t1_dgj1mwt	1492716335	Read UNSC resolution 1973.  When performing duties for the UN the only time the President requires congressional approval is when there's an actual declaration of war.  In Libya there was only a mandate to protect the civilian population (the no-fly zone that stopped civilians from being bombed).  Therefore what Obama did was well withing constitutional limitation on the executive as well as maintaining his responsibilities as laid out in the UNSC charter.  With Trump he's striking military targets on the ground that weren't currently threatening anyone (planes on the ground, not the air).  And there's no UN mandate regarding Syria and this doesn't fall under the UAMF issued for Iraq and used for fighting terrorists since then.	Galadron	t1_dgiyeti

t3_66b30m	t1_dgj4upy	1492719779	Correct.  But war was never declared in Libya.  You're welcome to read the history of the UNSC and how congress insisted that they still have to be the ones to declare war but how the president is allowed to act on his own in cases where it's a matter of protecting other members or themselves, as well as any sort of policing action.  That's why Obama was allowed to act on his own, because the UN didn't declare war, simply mandated that its member attempt to do what they can in order to minimize civilian casualties.  So once again.... There was no war declared in Libya, but the UN mandated that civilians be helped.  In Syria, there's no war, and no UN resolution.  That's why one is legal and the other isn't.

t3_66kewr	t1_dgj5hfk	1492720461	This is new    &gt; There is also an interesting tidbit regarding Clinton’s attitude toward the privacy of her staff’s emails. “After losing to Mr. Obama in the protracted 2008 primary,” the Journal’s review says, Clinton “was convinced that she had lost because some staffers – she wasn’t sure who – had been disloyal. So she ‘instructed a trusted aide to access the campaign’s server and download the [email] messages sent and received by top staffers.’”    &gt; In other words, Clinton – in some Nixonian fit of paranoia – violated the privacy of her senior advisers in her own mole hunt, a revelation that reflects on her own self-described “mistake” to funnel her emails as Secretary of State through a private server rather than a government one. As the Journal’s review puts it: “she didn’t want anyone reading her emails the way she was reading those of her 2008 staffers.”    &gt; But there is even a greater irony in this revelation because of the current complaint from Clinton and her die-hard supporters that Russia sabotaged her campaign by releasing emails via WikiLeaks from the DNC, which described how party leaders had torpedoed the campaign of Clinton’s rival for the nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and other emails from her campaign chairman John Podesta, revealing the contents of Clinton’s paid speeches to Wall Street banks and some pay-to-play features of the Clinton Foundation.

t3_66kewr	t1_dgj5mzx	1492720627	All we know about Russian hackers (and let us be sure to recall that actual content of the Podesta emails was a potent exposure of Hillary Clinton's subservience to the oligarchy) comes from the intelligence agencies, an unabashedly war-with-Russia faction of the deep state, and the folks that brought us fake WMD's in 2003. Why not stop pretending that Clinton was anything but a right-wing candidate?	exgalactic	t1_dgj5c4s
t3_66kfvy	t1_dgj5pe7	1492720700	It sounds like the other way around. Trump can't touch the FBI right now, and if leaks imperil any potential legal proceedings against Trump's administration or campaign team, "no leaking" is a bad thing for Trump.	winstonjpenobscot	t1_dgj5ey6

But in this case we're talking about a district judge in Hawaii, not a circuit court (which also have their own jurisdictions, making the question again valid).

The full title of the review is:   [Why Hillary Clinton Really Lost;  An insider book on Campaign 2016 reveals a paranoid Hillary Clinton who spied on staff emails after losing in 2008 and carried her political dysfunction into her loss to Donald Trump](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2017/04/19/why-hillary-clinton-really-lost)      The book is written by campaign reporters Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes and is called ["Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign"](https://www.amazon.com/Shattered-Inside-Hillary-Clintons-Campaign/dp/0553447084)     Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, who wrote “Game Change” in 2010 and “Double Down” in 2013 have their book coming next year.

t3_66dnnw	t1_dgj9fev	1492724823	&gt; Second, show me specifically in the California Education Code Section 89030.1 where 'color of law' is referenced and how that fits this case.   Yeah, you don't understand it.  It doesn't have to be referenced.  The code section that I referred you to is simply proof that the CA university system is a government agency capable of making rules and governing its campuses, which proves that the university system is acting under color of law.  It's not that I can't answer the question, it's that you don't understand the answer.  &gt; Hey you admit it is a student activity that would likely cause disruption.  Nope.  The student activity is not causing anything other than public speech.  Other people are causing the disruption, not the students who arranged the speaker.  &gt; That is not 100% true; Tinker is about student's actions causing a disruption.  That's 100% ridiculous, a distinction without a difference.  &gt; Again this fits Tinker. On a side note, do you honestly think no students would be involved with the protests and violence surrounding such an event? You'd have to be awfully ignorant to believe no students would be involved after the recent incidents.  Again, I think you are reading *Tinker* incorrectly.  ** They neither interrupted school activities nor sought to intrude in the school affairs or the lives of others. They caused discussion outside of the classrooms, but no interference with work and no disorder. In the circumstances, our Constitution does not permit officials of the State to deny their form of expression. ** * Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist*, 393 U.S. 503 (1969).  The students who invited Ann Coulter (and Ann Coulter, herself) have done nothing to cause any disruption on campus.  Others have threatened violence, but not students (AFAIK).  Peaceful protest by students is not a disruption or a security threat, it's a part of campus life.  If we follow your logic * ad absurdam *, any time someone wants to protest any speaker, the campus will have to shut down the public forum.  The proper response to the threatened outside violent protest is for civil authorities to ensure civil order, not to cancel a public forum because of its content.	CEvonk	t1_dgilma0

t3_66kewr	t1_dgj9nxv	1492725100	Exactly fucking this. The 2016 election cycle was a perfect storm of bullshit for her to lose. Here's a tiny fraction of what contributed to the loss.  * The US political pendulum. Democrats have only held the presidency through 3 consecutive terms twice in the country's history.  * She ran the same kind of campaign she ran in 2008 against people using the same kind of populist rhetoric she lost to that year.  * The FBI investigation into the email server was hugely damaging to her cause and the actions of her and her associates didn't make it look better (the Comey Letter, leaked by rat-fink Chaffetz also had a sizable impact).  * The Republicans have been smearing her since at least her days as First Lady.  * Fake news (primarily created by ultra-partisan useful idiots backed largely by Russia) swayed public opinion with (generally old) Facebook users.  * The media refused to make the election about policy at all. Both the Trump and Clinton campaign also refused to talk policy (one because they didn't have any policies, the other because they suck at explaining the policies in a way that doesn't put people to sleep).  * The media also made a huge deal out of Superdelegates supporting Clinton from the moment the Democratic race started giving the impression that the primaries were rigged (regardless of whether they were or not).  * The DNC and state Democratic parties reinforced the aforementioned impression by attacking Sanders supporters and using extremely shady procedural tricks to get as many delegates for Clinton as they could.  * Sanders made a big deal out of her Wall Street speeches implying that they were, at best, evidence that she would represent Wall Street instead of the people and, at worst, that they might have evidence of a quid pro quo in them.  All of this is before we even begin talking about sexism, racism, economic anxiety, and other sociological shit that influenced voters.	Rantheur	t1_dgj63ca

t3_66dnnw	t1_dgjd3da	1492729393	You are either too dense to understand what I am asking or a troll. I am asking what specific section of California Education Code Section 89030.1 fits in with the school's decision to cancel this event and how 'color of law' fits this action. The school did not create any legislation or rules or laws, nor did the school try to bend any laws to fit their goals. The school **and** law enforcement could not guarantee a safe event at this time, the school cancelled the speech and offered to reschedule at a later time.   &gt; The student activity is not causing anything other than public speech.    The student activity in Tinker was only wearing a black armband. If wearing that black armband had caused others to riot, then they would have lost the case.    &gt; That's 100% ridiculous, a distinction without a difference.    There is a huge difference. The students wearing the armbands in Tinker were not expected to cause a disturbance. School administration expected others to cause a disturbance when they saw armbands on the students.    &gt; They neither interrupted school activities nor sought to intrude in the school affairs or the lives of others. They caused discussion outside of the classrooms, but no interference with work and no disorder. In the circumstances, our Constitution does not permit officials of the State to deny their form of expression.    That is why the students won the case. The justices did not stop there though, they continued by saying that under the Constitution Congress (and the States) may not abridge the right to free speech, but this provision does permit reasonable regulation of speech-connected activities in carefully restricted circumstances.    The Justices' majority opinion continued:    &gt; As we have discussed, the record does not demonstrate any facts which might reasonably have led school authorities to forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities, and no disturbances or disorders on the school premises in fact occurred.  The Justices' are saying that if there are reasonable facts that would lead school authorities to forecast substantial disruption, disturbance or disorder on the school premises (they did not in any of their text say "by students"), the Constitution would permit officials of the State to deny their form of expression.    The hurdle is not students rioting, the hurdle is a riot due to the event.	TheBraveSirRobin	t1_dgj9fev

Two of those amendments were not ratified until the 20th century, and the other, which was ratified in the 1860s, wasn't actually enforced until the 20th century.

Two weeks after the inauguration, [CEO Wadie Habboush met with Steve Bannon and unnamed NSC staffers about lifting sanctions on Venezuela] (https://mic.com/articles/172936/trump-tied-businessmen-met-nsc-officials-bannon-over-venezuela-sanctions-sources-say#.9QUqsXCRn).  Quote: &gt;The first of the meetings between Beach, Habboush and National Security Council officials took place on Feb. 8, according to one source with knowledge of the matter. Habboush presented senior NSC officials with a detailed plan to improve political relations with Venezuela and lift U.S. sanctions in exchange for opening up the South American country to potential business opportunities with U.S.-based companies.  &gt;The next day, Habboush returned to the White House and presented the plan directly to White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, the two sources said.  &gt;...  &gt;According to one of the sources, Beach and Habboush set up their meetings with NSC officials through deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland. Beach's attorney confirmed that Beach and McFarland were acquainted. "He knows K.T. McFarland, only because they **met at inauguration,"** Liddle said.  &gt;Once at the White House, Habboush presented NSC officials — and Bannon, a day later — with a detailed 10-point plan outlining a proposal to lift U.S. sanctions on the country, according to a source. Habboush told NSC officials he had met directly with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Foreign Minister Delcy Rodríguez prior to his visit, multiple sources confirmed. At one point, Habboush dialed Rodríguez and put her on the phone with an NSC official on the spot to demonstrate the legitimacy of his contacts with high-level Venezuelans, one source said.	longweekends	t3_66lory
t3_66lkl4	t1_dgjk613	1492738374	How dare Rumsfeld think he did the right thing?   The Great Society was a joke, it started only after 15 years of declining poverty rates only to see them bottom out shortly after it was enacted. Despite what you are told it saw the end to declining poverty rates, not the start. The only reason it looks impressive is that we only started tracking real poverty rates in 1959, but the estimates before that show that it had been declining since the end of ww2. [Source](http://www.chartbookofeconomicinequality.com/inequality-by-country/usa/)The other problem with with the Great society is that it lead to the collapse of the black family, the used to have a higher rate of children being born in wedlock compared to whites, now 75% of black children are born into single parent households.	tommyrp	t1_dgjhj4l

t3_66m77u	t1_dgjke1p	1492738638	"The plan — draft legislation from House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Phil Roe, R-Tenn. — would deduct $2,400 from future service members’ paychecks to establish eligibility for revamped post-military education benefits. This was first reported Tuesday by Task &amp; Purpose."  "Currently, the post-9/11 GI Bill offers full tuition to a four-year state college (or the equivalent tuition payout for a private school) plus a monthly housing stipend to any service member who spends at least three years on active duty, and to reservists who are mobilized to active-duty for extended periods. Troops wounded while serving are also eligible."  "Unlike the older Montgomery GI Bill benefit, the post-9/11 GI Bill does not require any fees or pay reductions for eligibility. The new proposal would change that, taking up to $100 a month from new enlistees’ paychecks for the right to access the benefit after they leave the ranks."  "The money collected would amount to a fraction of the overall cost of the veterans education benefit. Congressional staff estimate the move would bring in about $3.1 billion over the next 10 years, while total GI Bill spending is expected to total more than $100 billion over the same decade."

t3_66m77u	t1_dgjlziz	1492740548	For context, when I enlisted in 1998, you had to contribute $100 a month for 12 months to be eligible for benefits. I hadn't realized it changed, but the contribution requirement was apparently revamped with the new GI bill in 2009. The new GI bill has potentially over twice the benefit of the original for the service members, depending on the school. I'm not saying it's a good idea, I think service members should get every benefit we can afford to throw at them, but this isn't a new idea, and is more of a reversion to the previous program, with a larger contribution requirement.	tkengland	t3_66m77u

They replaced it with the Post-9/11 GIB, and did away with the buy in / kicker.    To put this in perspective, we recruit somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 people a year to serve in the military.  We'll be conservative, and say it's 150,000.    We say the average enlistee makes around $20,000 in base pay each year, that's a total cost of around $6 billion dollars in wages.     They want to take about $360 million in wages away from the lowest earning members of the US miltiary.  That's a 6% tax on someone who is making around $10/hr.      You know how much we paid federal controls **IN ONE YEAR**?  $154 Billion.  The Post-9/11 is expected to cost around $100 Billion over a decade.  And they want to reduce this cost by ~$3 Billion by taxing the troops?  You have to be fucking kidding me.  How about you chop off $3 Billion from the federal contracting budget.

A rule that prevents health insurers from varying premiums within a geographic area based on age, gender, health status or other factors.  Meaning they could discriminate on any of the above.

To those on the right: if you're pointing out hypocrisy, it exists on both sides of the aisle; further, said hypocrisy would be ostensibly understood as in opposition to him being a "socialist," whose '3 homes' would effectively negate that argument. To those on the left: 2 homes is not extravagant. Also, if you're not behind Bernie, then who are you behind? Also, this is a lifetime of wealth (he's old) between 2 individuals, he and his wife.

If he were to take those proceeds from the book sales and put that into affordable housing, making a handful of new $70-100k homes and setting them up with first-time home buyers for an intentionally low interest rate, then he could help more and more people buy homes and get out of the Rent Trap.

t3_66r18j	t1_dgkomhy	1492803485	Like I said elsewhere, the first two homes are understandable. Yes, us little scrubs don't even have one, but he does a lot of work, both in Vermont and in DC, and having a home in each makes sense.  It's the third home, that cost more than most people make in 10 years, right before calling people out for such spending that is hypocritical.  But you can still call for equality. I'd just expect you to pony up do what you can to work on that, within reason.  Make a company that specifically gives better interest rates and low or no down payments to first time buyers trying to buy a home below the median range in the area. Remember that home loans are loans with collateral built in. If someone defaults, that company already has a house they can finance with only the cost of upkeep in the meantime. And I guarantee there would be a waiting list for this.  Sanders and Buffett and all the other rich people (both rich and mega rich) could do a lot of good with their extra money before opening their sights to a new vacation house.  But if they aren't willing to do that, then maybe they don't really believe in equality like they say they do.	kinyutaka	t1_dgkn96o
t3_66rcwq	t1_dgkomve	1492803497	I think what universities should do is host more formal debates. There's a lot of right wing people wanting to speak there, and that's perfectly fine, but it might do the universities' PR well to try and create a middle ground with a debate.   If anything, it would help expose the students, left or right, to these different view points without them being turned off by the idea of sitting in a lecture hall for over and hour of "You're completely wrong."   So if they can take the initiative and and say "Alright, we're going to have a debate on XYZ from both sides of the issue." There'd be less chance of censorship, less chance of people outcrying about university censorship, but also a chance for both sides to have their views on the chopping block or if one side ends up being more accurate than the other, that side to be able to better refine their views.

If he wants to retire to the waterfront, then he can chose to keep the Vermont home or sell it.  After he retires, it's less important what he does. Frankly, the third home isn't all that important now.  It's the statement about buying what you don't need when buying a home he doesn't need. That's the problem.

t3_66rcwq	t1_dgku0cr	1492810127	You're right that the fact that the university is a state institution doesn't mean that everyone has a right to use its resources however they want. It does mean, however, that it can't engage in viewpoint discrimination in how it makes its resources available. E.g., if it lets liberal student groups schedule liberal speakers at its auditorium, it must also let conservative student groups bring in conservative speakers.	PubliusVA	t1_dgkrabp
t3_66rcwq	t1_dgku1e0	1492810164	Case in point.  The students shouldn't be the ones in charge here.  They *certainly* shouldn't be allowed to commit violent criminal acts just because they don't like what someone else is saying.	Doomsday31415	t1_dgktj12

And for this question, this means we have a real world independent variable to compare with.  Canada did NOT follow the nation wide tough on crime model the U.S. did...and it's crime fell as well.

Record fund-raising and spending by Ossoff, an unpopular president, a divided set of a dozen or more republicans versus a single DNC candidate, voter fatigue among the RNC and fired up DNC (allegedly).  He should have had a down-hill coast of an election to a 5 point win and it didn't happen.  Now he has to campaign all over again in a run-off election and the republicans will be fighting him instead of each other.  He may win, there's still a chance, but I don't think it's likely.

t3_66r18j	t1_dgkyq98	1492816606	He *did* say that!  He specifically asks "How many yachts do billionaires need? How many cars do they need? Give us a break, you can't have it all!" Implying incredulity at the fact that someone bought another yacht.  If he is "allowed" to buy a third house without is being called "unnecessary", then you can't say Bill Gates or Oprah or any other multimillionaire or billionaire doesn't deserve a collection of old cars.  Pick one or the other. Either Bernie is being perfectly reasonable in buying the house and he is a hypocrite for calling out richer people with unnecessary purchases because he doesn't consider his unnecessary, or the third home is itself unnecessary and he is a hypocrite because he thinks only others should follow his rules.  But he is a hypocrite. Which isn't surprising, because he is a career politician.	kinyutaka	t1_dgky95h
t3_66sgn4	t1_dgkyqw7	1492816632	He supports police when they arrest minorities and poor people of petty crimes. He attacks police when they aren't doing this.  That's pretty much all there is to it. He still wants to live in 1950's Alabama.	fyhr100	t3_66sgn4
t3_66rcwq	t1_dgkyrwq	1492816670	Now you're attacking me based on preconceptions you have on my beliefs.  I don't even know or care what Ann's speech is about.  What does matter is that instead of fighting her speech *intellectually*, you're fighting it *physically*.  So instead of come up with an actual argument, you assume that I'm not a "real lover of liberty" simply because I don't prescribe to the same "safe space" idea as you.	Doomsday31415	t1_dgkyjzq

t3_66rcwq	t1_dgkzpug	1492817985	(in response to what you deleted)  They literally postponed the speech because they couldn't risk the violent protest that would break out if it occurred.  So yes, physical.  Just because you can't come up with an intellectual argument that changes their opinion, doesn't mean you get to resort to violence.  &gt; You're the one who wants a safe space.  I do pay taxes, after all.  All public property should be safe.  &gt; Everyone else is saying is arguing with you and you don't like it.  Arguing?

t3_66rcwq	t1_dgl0yq3	1492819652	&gt; Sure I do. If you go somewhere with the intention of creating chaos than you are responsible for that.  That's an assertion you've made without any evidence to back it up.  Just because some people don't like her message, doesn't mean she's giving it to create chaos.  &gt; Now let me guess, anything other than sitting down and listening politely is violence to you?  There are different types of violence, but shouting and screaming to prevent people from hearing what she has to say is also a no go.  It's not violence per-se, but it's definitely unacceptable.  But if you want to put it that way, yes.  She has the floor, so she gets to speak.  The university didn't invite her to have people shout how much of a facist she is.	Doomsday31415	t1_dgl0bgi
t3_66rcwq	t1_dgl1mc6	1492820523	Oh sorry, I thought this article was about someone being uninvited from somewhere and conservatives screaming about how that was muzzling free speech, and that that was somehow similar to uninviting someone from somewhere and that person complaining about the same thing.

Yet you don't expect the far right to vote with you?  A 3rd party is what we need.  A place for liberals to feel comfortable, and Democrats can grow by having the center and trying to get votes from the fringe of each party.  I'm getting real sick of hearing how the far left is hijacking America, when all that has happened since 2010 is a huge land slide for Republicans at every level of government.

t3_66t4l7	t1_dglfcor	1492843232	1. I'm searching through my post and I'm struggling to find this whining that you're referring to.    2. My point was that we all have a right endowed upon us by the constitution to say whatever is on our mind, regardless of how productive you may personally feel it is. But we all also have a right, as is in your case, to call it stupid or whiney or unproductive.  3. I'm drawing a parallel between this current discussion and say, the Milo protests at Berklee. A party can say something and another party can disagree, even aggressively, as long as one of those parties is not a part of the government. So while I think you're a dick for calling me whiney, I do in reality support your freedom to do so. I am not stupid enough to call it "suppression of free speech" like the right does for hours at a time on Fox news.	motivatedsinger	t1_dglf3er

However I just don't think common sense wise that it makes sense to bash our president openly for absolutely no reason. Nothing will ever get done positively from doing that so why not actually try and do something that will change something.   3) you can't talk about suppression of free speech without including CNN, MSNBC, and countless other liberal/anti-trump news sites not even giving the political opposition the time of day to state their opinion. Fox News is not even close to liberal media when it comes to suppression of free speech	bipples1248	t1_dglfcor

I'm ranting about essentially after Milo was supposed to speak at Berkeley and he got like 90 minutes of airtime on Fox claiming the left was suppressing free speech. I'm saying that protesters protesting his presentation is different than if the government shut his speech down. The latter is a violation of the constitution, the former is completely reasonable.   3) Fuck all 24 hour cable news networks.	motivatedsinger	t1_dglfhni

Sort of how r/politics incivility policy seems to work.

Their story does not make a whole lot of sense so a lot of people suspect that there are some falsehoods involved.  My favorite theory is that Mike Pence was in the room when Yates was telling them about Flynn. There are certainly a few other possibilities but considering the insane way they used Nunes to prevent her testimony (and the fact it will now be in private) suggests she has some real juicy things to say.

All you did was demonstrate an *ad hominem* that did not address Nye's premise for that quote.  &gt;As Nye explained, the shortage has stunted farming and pushed young people to look for work in more densely populated areas.   &gt;“Young people have gone to big cities looking for work. There’s not enough work for everybody, so the disaffected youths, as we say — the young people who don’t believe in the system, believe the system has failed, don’t believe in the economy — are more easily engaged and more easily recruited by terrorist organizations, and then they end up part way around the world in Paris shooting people,” Nye said.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-nye-climate-change-paris-terrorism_us_565ccdebe4b079b2818b810b  The link between Climate Change, water shortages, farm job loss, negative economic impact, disaffected folks, etc. is not  hard to understand.  &gt;As long as Nye explains everything with climate change he can fuck off if he wants to be a political activist he has to go ever further and first lift the people in the US up so they can afford to give a crap about his pet issue.  That is a straw man of Nye's premise.    That straw man can fuck off.	SaltHash	t1_dglh7gr

There is legit science that says a person can identify as a man if they don't have dangly parts. So you are wrong.   Even if you weren't wrong, it still wouldn't matter. You shouldn't discriminate against people for trivial reasons like what parts they were born with or what you believe a bathroom should be or what you believe gender roles should be. Discrimination is bad whether you think the victims are "not legit" or not. Even if you were right, there is still no real reason to have separate bathrooms.

t3_66uuld	t1_dgli0gu	1492851130	Ah the old mandatory urinal law.  So. I work in medicine. I work in trauma to be specific. Guess which part of men occasionally gets amputated accidently, or burned, or avulsed beyond recognition. It doesn't happen a lot, but I've seen it occur. So, as this is not always reparable, these men go on living their lives with a compromised urogenital system, one that among other things, precludes the use of urinals. I suppose you'd ask these men to use the ladies room, based on your... Policy... Fantasy... Whatever. Because... Urinals.   Trans women also undergo this thing called grs, a process which also... precludes the use of urinals in the traditional sense btw. So without the ability to properly use a urinal I assume you believe they should then be allowed to use the women's room?  Is this seeming inconsistent somehow? Hmm. I wonder why? Could it be that any rational social practices not derived from the ideological stance that necesses a strict division of gendered spaces based purely on anatomy or genetics, but rather one based on lived social gender is actually the default that we already use?

t3_66uuld	t1_dglic6d	1492852221	And when you make such a claim sir, or future madame as the case may be, I will not present any such argument.   Should you use such a claim to engage in assault or voyuerism I should expect such laws as are in place at the current time regarding such behaviours to come into effect and bear upon you the full weight of Justice.   I do believe that semantics such as you are arguing would not (nor every have) hold up in a court of law should they be presented as an argument towards excusing such behavior, regardless of protections of access for transgender people that may exist.    You may be convinced that the world is susceptible to such tactics but I would caution you against testing such theories unless you looked forward with a positive view to a lengthy and uncomfortable incarceration.

t3_66uuld	t1_dgligkf	1492852623	That point is fact and is conceded. Segregation had a long and sad history in this country and was used to excuse a good deal of violence. Should such laws arise again, in any fashion, I imagine they will have a similar effect.	Graaaaass_tastes_bad	t1_dglif6z
t3_66uuld	t1_dgligt4	1492852645	How would you prove what exactly? Assault? Voyuerism?   Is your assertion that any man can simply walk into a women's changing area in a locale with trans access protections and say "the law says I'm allowed to be here!"? Is your assertion that such a claim would go unchallenged by staff or the legal system?   I believe I could prove rather easily this was not the case as such an attempt was made by a conservative activist protesting trans access in the aforementioned Washington State, an event which explicitly proceeded that statement by the Washington State AG that I mentioned.  That man was removed by the staff by the way and is currently unidentified as his identification would lead to charges being brought against him, as stated by the Washington State AG.   Never in the legal history of this country, or in fact any country, has such an action been upheld as legal or protected despite trans access protections having existed in some locales for decades.

From what we've seen so far, and without a serious pivot or two, we can expect to see the following over the next 18 months:   * Little-to-no major legislation from the GOP-led Congress unless it appeals to Democrats as well. * Gutting of the "administrative state" and anything Obama touched - some for completely senseless reasons. * Rollback of any protection for middle class Americans that they can find. Only exception, guns. * Appointments that are either far-right, wholly-incompetent, or both. * A culture of severe attention deficit and duplicity. A fondness for distractions and misdirections. * More dictators and human rights violators welcomed into the WH. * Corruption and self-dealing and secretive meetings run rampant. * Russia, Russia, more Russia.	watthefucksalommy	t1_dglkf2f

SO, their video on "how to fix" this was released in april of 2016. Not too long after South dakota actually managed to achieve something like this bill. The citizens came together with enough votes to put in an anti corruption act that enabled term limits, limited donations and most importantly held strict penalties for rule breakers.   Now, what was south dakota's house response to this bill? Declare a state of emergency and block citizens from voting on it. That is a state of emergency, IE, the ruskies have invaded, aliens have landed, fucking we're being bombed by allah himself. What was the emergency though? Politicians about to lose their gravy train.   People showed up and protested the vote of course. For what little it mattered. And they lost their power to affect anything. The repeal was rushed through and approved before a court could even get their hands on it and that is all she wrote. Sure people are still protesting and complaining. But they've been doing it for months, now almost no one even remembers this happened.   Simply put. There is no peaceful solution to corruption in america. SD proves that there are rules in place to prevent such peaceful attempts   Its time to wake up to that fact and either accept corruption or do something about it. Both sides are to blame and both sides operate under the same rules. Personally i hope i live to see the day that corrupt politicians are dragged out into the streets to be hung and eaten while we hoist honest ones into their new positions with the hope that they will follow the rules and we won't have to do this again.

Meanwhile, people die and get sick in droves, have their lives ruined by gargantuan invisible giants.

Maybe you haven't looked around much to notice that you've been unwittingly influenced by a Russian propaganda machine. You might think that's ok and that Russia should be our friend, but Putin's government doesn't share the American values that I assume you hold dear, and their whole intent is to create these divides in OUR country. I know you're smarter than to fall for something like that. I'm not saying you are a bootlicker, but many people fall into this trap of being a bootlicker when they don't have to be, and they bow down and assume that the authority figures who say what they want to hear actually care about who they are talking to. There are better ways. Why don't you go out, search for some things yourself, and maybe you'll see what is really happening with this administration and other fascist movements in the world. If you need any help, you can PM me, I'd be glad to help you out.  May you have a great day, open your mind, and receive many titties from girls. Peace!	vvp1	t1_dgltc51

t3_66uxz3	t1_dglvs8d	1492880013	I've seen this a couple of times now on Reddit and decided to actually look into it this time.  &gt;The citizens came together with enough votes to put in an anti corruption act that enabled term limits, limited donations and most importantly held strict penalties for rule breakers.  This is mostly accurate except for the enabled term limits bit, can't find anything about that in the summary for Initiated Measure 22 (IM-22).  &gt;Source: https://ballotpedia.org/South_Dakota_Revision_of_State_Campaign_Finance_and_Lobbying_Laws,_Initiated_Measure_22_(2016)  The arguments for IM-22 were as follows:   &gt;Under current law, South Dakota is the only state in America where lobbyists can give unlimited gifts to politicians. IM-22 ends unlimited lobbyist gifts.  &gt;A recent study found corruption in government costs every South Dakotan about $1,300 per year. IM-22 eliminates this “corruption tax”: &gt; * IM-22 increases penalties for violations of campaign finance and lobbying laws. * IM-22 requires more transparency, so we know who’s buying influence in politics. * IM-22 toughens ethics law enforcement to investigate lobbyists and state officials for violations.  &gt;South Dakota needs this Anti-Corruption Act to stop big-money lobbyists from having more control than everyday citizens over our elected officials. IM-22 lets you control $100 of your own tax money, so you can support candidates who best represent your beliefs and values — or tell government not to spend it. It’s that simple. It’s your choice.  &gt;Special interest lobbyists oppose IM-22 because they benefit from a rigged political system and don’t want it changed. IM-22 was put on the ballot by more than 20,000 South Dakotans, including South Dakotans for Integrity, a group of conservatives, progressives, small business owners, veterans, retirees, and everyday South Dakotans who believe freedom and selfgovernance are the foundations of our democracy.  &gt;We need to restore a government of, by and for the people, not government for the highest bidder. We can’t fix every problem in politics, but IM-22 is a step in the right direction. While Washington remains gridlocked, South Dakota can lead the nation in government integrity by voting YES on IM-22.   The arguments against IM-22 are as follows:  &gt; * Forces South Dakota taxpayers to earmark millions of tax dollars to subsidize political campaign activity and causes they may not support;  * diverts public funds that could be spent on other core priorities such as education, transportation or public safety, or returned to taxpayers in the form of lower taxes or fees;  * compromises the constitutional rights of SD citizens to support the causes of their choice by stripping away individuals' right to privacy; and  * exposes SD residents to harassment and intimidation while imposing a chilling effect on speech and political dialogue.   I'm against corruption, but if I lived in SD I would be very concerned about the arguments raised by bullet points 2 and 3. The fact that IM-22 was introduced with no clear method of how to provision the proposed 12 million dollars for the individual credits is damning enough itself.  The main claim you are making, however is that the state of emergency was introduced to protect corrupt politicians from ethical oversight and transparency. The SD legislatures argue that they declared a state of emergency to overturn this bill on the grounds of it being unconstitutional and poorly drafted. They also claim that they are working to introduce legislature that incorporates some parts of IM-22. If that is true it would strengthen the argument against your claim, but I'm not going to bother researching if they have. (maybe you can?)  I don't think it's as simple an issue as 'GOP is bad, declared state of emergency to stay corrupt' when they have very real arguments against IM-22.	WhatsFairIsFair	t1_dglpf2k

His inauguration was January 20th, 2017, just 14 weeks ago.      At 1.67 days per week, and 14 weeks in office, Donald Trump is only 23 days into his Presidency, and won't reach day 100 for another 46 weeks.

The question is just how far, and the person that told him was (then) acting attorney general Sally Yates.     https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-warned-white-house-that-flynn-could-be-vulnerable-to-russian-blackmail-officials-say/2017/02/13/fc5dab88-f228-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html      People keep overlooking the significance of the fact that along with the DNC hack there was a similar hack of some Republicans emails though, possibly all of them. At best it's sure to contain seriously embarrassing information and an unflattering insight into the real 'locker room talk' but quite possibly evidence of minor or serious criminal conduct.

t3_66uxz3	t1_dgm4p0l	1492891985	The problem is yes, there is a way. There are many ways. But you get in the mindset of competition first. Then you get it in your head that in order to win, your rival must lose - there is no middleground there. Then once you're making progress you try to make things efficient, so that new entrants can't hurt you. At this point you will do anything to stay ahead until the gov. starts knocking. Then comes the lobbying and media attention. But you don't care about what others think because you're doing what you want. No one can touch you. It just keeps going and going.  It's just addictive if not carefully done. And I promise having a passion is far 'worse' of an addiction than any drug could ever be. With drugs your supplier can cut you off. With money, once you have enough you'll never lose your suppliers.  If people want to succeed in life they need this mindset. But so many take it too far. They get in trouble, ruin lives...It's terrible. They just don't know how to cope. And if you're already born into the life? You see the poor as beneath you, even if you don't realize it. You lack certain morals and principles. None of it really applies to you if you can get out of every problem you'll ever face.  This sounds so fucking terrible and I'm so sorry.

Are we really going to say "Tricky, tricky, Putin. We caught you, but we'll let you keep all of the appointments and policies you got in before we could pin you down." We need to roll back everything, have a special election and do it again right. I know that's huge and complicated, but this was a coup by another world superpower, *thats* huge.

t3_66wf2i	t1_dgm72qd	1492895138	How do you come up with the 11-year thing? The independence of the US is almost always reckoned from the signing of the Declaration of Independence (but you might argue it should be reckoned from the beginning of the Revolutionary War, generally considered April 19, 1775). The Constitution wasn't ratified until 1788, but the Declaration of Independence was the document that named a new country. It operated under that name under the Continental Congress and under the Articles of Confederation.	rnoyfb	t1_dglxzib
t3_66wf2i	t1_dgm78k5	1492895354	Yes I realize the articles were the first attempt at laws but the declaration made the goals of the colonists clear.

t3_66ya7c	t1_dgm7ivd	1492895745	this is why i don't trust cops...well, one of MANY, MANY reasons. from everything i've heard De Blasio say about cops, i recognize that he believes in them, and he believes that simple reforms can actually turn the police into law enforcement officers, to protect and serve.   personally, i think that is naive.

t3_66wu65	t1_dgm8jw2	1492897087	He'd only have that power if his impeachment trial is before Trump's. When the president is impeached, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides over the proceeding in the Senate. If there's enough to impeach and convict this many people, why not do them all at once? Most of the evidence will be the same; the accusations are the same.   (There is no point in impeaching the Speaker of the House because if they have enough votes in the House to do that, they can just expel him, anyway. So they may maneuver to have someone they'd rather be president take over as the new Speaker before the Senate starts hearing the impeachment.)	rnoyfb	t1_dglupvd

No one expects the POTUS to know everything, but surely he knows to shut up and hire smart people to lead so they can propose sensible policies.  For international policies, it's just embarrassing that America, as a country of immigrants, have arrived at this point in time after many sacrifices and blood shed and this dumbass shows up after having built his empire by screwing over immigrants who work for him and countries that manufacture his products.

In 2014 $1.4 trillion was paid in taxes, and the deficit was $483 billion.   24% less in taxes is $336 billion. So if this is the biggest tax cut in history, this would come close to doubling the deficit. (Though Trump plans on cutting spending, so this isn't exact)	gotenibehe	t3_66xs6p

It's talking down to interviewer after interviewer who asks him legitimate questions about subjects that science has yet to answer. It's the arrogant state of mind he exists in wherein he becomes aggressively hostile with anybody that questions his worldview.   Look up some of his interviews on youtube. He has a chip on his shoulder like some angsty teenager who just discovered atheism ala Bill Maher. It's not healthy and it only damages the credibility of his arguments by the very nature of it being *him* who is making the argument.   You'd never see a really brilliant scientist like Tyson or Hawking treat people the way Nye routinely does. That's because they're legitimately brilliant, qualified, and comfortable in their own skin instead of being an edgy poser who is barely even qualified to speak about the subject matter.

And Ham is an incredibly dishonest person that changes the subject and muddies the waters when he's losing. Of course he comes of as angry, he's visibly frustrated that his opponent doesn't have the decency to act like an adult.   It's funny how conservatives say science is politicized. It should be seeing how Nixon of all people created the EPA, but when one party is adamantly opposed to the impending threat of climate change, the fact that abstinence education is a failure, and that the social sciences use scientific methods and statistical analysis to support their claims, you can see why scientists lean left, because they really have no other option.

When you take major violent and property crimes as a whole, we had the fewest in history.  &gt;That was 2016. This year we began with the safest first three months of any first three months of any year in recorded history. Last month was the safest March in history.

They're getting hostile, to people who are denying things that have been proven FIFTY FUCKING YEARS AGO.

t3_66z4zx	t1_dgmycm6	1492943618	Actually Bill Nye holds several patents, he did in fact invent things.  Your analogy doesn't make sense, because it sounds like you'd be saying that someone who invented an improvement to some device, such as improving transmissions so they could be automatically shifted instead of manually changed, just "put things together."  He's an engineer, not a fabricator, he's not putting things together, he's designing them.	gaeuvyen	t1_dgmv39t
t3_66z4zx	t1_dgmydpx	1492943714	Yeah, but Nye holds actual patents, so he did invent things. It would be like saying the first person to make an acrylic table as a replacement to a glass table, didn't make anything new.	gaeuvyen	t1_dgmw20z

t3_66z4zx	t1_dgmym7c	1492944441	Yeah. Funny, the idea that the earth was the center of the universe wasn't just some baseless idea founded on religion and mans own ego. It had been "confirmed" by scientific method for thousands of years. We had mathematical models based on a geocentric universe that accurately predicted the movements of celestial bodies. Galileo was challenging a very entrenched scientific theory (and I do mean the scientific definition of "theory") that was supported by the vast majority of his contemporaries. And for that he was thrown in jail.   Nye takes the same imperial attitude towards science that the church did.	Whiggly	t1_dgmfa8c

I saw "American" in the title and quickly snatched it up to watch with my kids that night.  Imagine my horror when, a little ways into it, I realized it was pro-immigration propaganda.  Not to mention those mice seemed a little... long in the nose if you catch my drift.  Which really isn't appropriate for Christian children either.

We can certainly debate its success, but it's at least indisputable that he has been the CEO of large companies that he created.  Ivanka doesn't even have that claim. She's spent most of her career working within Trump Enterprises, where of course she has been protected and favored. She cannot even claim to have survived the rigors of ordinary corporate America. This reflects a troubling lack of experience for someone appointed a senior advisor to the president, with such a big staff that she needs her own chief of staff.  Both Jared and Ivanka are just way out of their league, being given responsibilities that would intimidate vastly more competent and experienced people (i.e.: professionals). They don't realize it, and they may not even want it. They are both being set up for catastrophic failure and the ruin of their careers.	sfsdfd	t1_dgn2zrq

The myth of the worthy millionaire is rendered false by trump himself, who can't even state a coherent fact about empirical events, and yet has managed to hold onto the fortune he inherited without any serious intellectual achievement.

A lot of NYPD come from these areas. The police that I know have a problem with how law enforcement is looked at across the country but won't condemn police who are the bad apples. It's like they are bitter about how they are being represented but will defend every action another cop makes, even if it is wrong. The brotherhood is strong but it's what puts a wall between communities and the police. There is definitely an underlying racism within some of the cops I know. It's disgusting. NYPD has made some strides recently and made an effort to hire more people of color. This made all the whites kids trying to get into the academy bitter, so there is even some tension between the police themselves.	xjukix	t1_dgm7uoh

None of the representatives in border states have said they'd support the wall, and polling in Texas shows people are overwhelmingly against the wall. Ted Cruz has an opportunity to take a *very* public stand against the Administration and say he will absolutely not vote for any budget that has funding for the wall. It'd position him well for a 2018 or 2020 campaign as an outspoken republican against Trump, who, by then will be a liability in everyone who supported them. Ted Cruz has been quiet, which makes me believe he is smart enough to see that. He has shown he is willing to shutdown the government before, and being the opportunist he is, I don't doubt Ted Cruz might shutdown the government over the wall. Ultimately, if Trump is not willing to sign any budget without the wall, it will give the Democrats more leverage in negotiating so that Congress can achieve a veto proof majority budget.

It would do this through a “border adjustment” that exempts exports while taxing imports. Under the plan, all imports coming into the United States would be subject to the 20 percent tax, but exports would have the tax refunded — making them tax-free.  But there's the rub. A tariff on imported goods *makes them fucking cost more when you buy them*. This has two immediate effects. One, Americans who buy imported Mexican goods will be the ones who cough up the money. Two, people will stop buying things that cost more, so this ridiculous scheme won't even raise enough funds to pay for a new post office, much less $20 billion worth of concrete.  It would be bad enough if this was merely a bait-and-switch. It's worse than that, none if this is going to work at all. The money is never going to be forthcoming. Look at the terrain around the border, there's nowhere to put it. There's a fucking river along half of it, surrounded by rugged terrain. You can't put a wall there without either taking land from Mexico or giving it to them.  There is never going to be any border wall.	Dear_Occupant	t3_67472u

I think some people in the corner didn't hear you. :)  There are more progressives in the country than Democrats. The old identity-politics coalition is dead.  Check out Sanders' recent numbers in the Harvard poll. He is more popular with people of color and with women than with white men.  Also, check out the new Economist/YouGov poll.  A majority --- a **majority** of American citizens support Medicare-4-All.  See the new WaPo poll showing that 2/3rds of voters agree that the Democratic Party is out-of-touch.  Sanders draws from both corporatist parties.    This is what it looks like when the Whig Party dies and a new party rises to take its place.

There was no/little government welfare available. In short, companies knew the government wasn't picking up the bill and they still paid their employees next to nothing.

t3_67263l	t1_dgnvlx7	1492992684	Without a minimum wage, people could apply for jobs at the price they want to work for. Your labor is a product that you have to market and sell to companies. You set the price, and the company chooses if it is a bargain or if they are being ripped off. You can make your product cheaper, so more companies are willing to buy it. If your product is very high quality, you can charge more for it. If you set your price low, but the quality is fantastic, you can ask for a raise, and if the buyer sees it worth it to spend more on a better product, then you will get a raise. A system like this benefits hard workers. A welfare system benefits those who do mediocre work, if any at all, because if your product is good, you're not on welfare.	ToastableToast	t1_dgnurtl

The process for determining harm or viability isn't tied to bias or experience with a given compound. It's achieved through rigor, hypothesis, observation, and verification.   [Tyrone Hayes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrone_Hayes) is a potentially interesting example. He worked with the company, held assumptions that might benefit that company, and proved himself wrong. Now he's their target.

t3_6765tp	t1_dgo69n6	1493008104	Sure. Trump himself and whatever policies he may or may not be able to put in place were secondary to the immediate goal of not having Hillary Clinton as president. She was vocally hostile towards the Putin regime, called his 2011 reelection rigged, and was generally hard line on Russia and had Neolib and Neocon backing on that agenda. Clearly Russia was successful in that endeavor.   The secondary goal, but of greater long term importance to Russia, was to exacerbate political, economic, and racial divides in the US electorate, and to undermine faith and trust in our government, the mainstream media, and the western democratic system as a whole. That aim was in large part achieved as well, since we're at a level of division unparalleled since the Great Depression, or possibly even pre-Civil War, depending on the metrics you're looking at.   Lastly, there's a preponderance of evidence that there was a direct financial quid pro quo between Russia and a number of Trump's key campaign advisors, and potentially Trump himself.

And this is after a year of spin and countless, obviously politically motivated false narratives thrown at us by various news outlets and the Democrats, who clearly work hand in hand to some degree. Let's wait until some actual proof surfaces. And if no proof is ever found, will this narrative end? Of course not. It will just turn into a new narrative about how the investigation was sabotaged, sort of like the one we're seeing in this article. What actually does scare me are the manipulative ties between the left and the media. And it should scare you too, because when one political party has this much control over the narratives presented to the public via mainstream news, that's a pretty dangerous thing in terms of a free society. And there's a lot more evidence for that than there is for Trump being a Russian puppet. This is also in plain sight to anyone who has an ounce of critical thinking. Just step back and look at all these sensationalist headlines, break them down, and get to the bottom of what the real "controversy" is. You wonder why people are so die-hard in their defense of Trump? It is because they are constantly having to dissect the bullshit and spin presented to them by liberal news. They've witnessed countless manufactured attempts to take him down in the form of twisting of words, out of contexts smears, slanted polls, double standards, and supposedly non-partisan news outlets shoving nothing down their throats and telling them it's something. I don't give a shit how he acts. In fact, I think he's perfect, because he obviously doesn't give a shit about the manufactured outrage. He just says what's on his mind, and if they spin it into hysteria, he moves on. He's the perfect antidote for all that's wrong with society today, with all it's overly PC, hypersensitive, fear mongering, sensationalist bullshit. Plus, I want his policies passed.

To be the one who stands up for what's right and executes to the best of his ability the duties and responsibilities of his office? Maybe there's a level I'm not seeing or they're trying to hold America together long enough to push some sort of agenda.

t3_67263l	t1_dgoem1m	1493029924	In the Strauss-Howe Generational theory we are right on track. Bannon thought he understood it, but he refused to look at history to see the likely outcome.  In the theory we are in the crisis phase, or turning. Hopefully this started in the early 2000's since each turning can last up to 25 years. The last crisis started in 1929 and ended at the end of WW2.  How the crisis turning ends is anyone's guess. The theory can't provide specifics since the outcome relies on events that can't be predicted.  My guess is we will see another recession soon enough. The political reaction will be to reward financial companies and punish everybody else just like last time. We have not recovered from the last recession so it's going to be pretty god damn bad.  Once that shits over with then we will begin the cycle again with a high turning. Just hope you don't starve to death between now and then or some dumb war doesn't start up. Let's hope our version of WW2 is fighting global warming and pollution.	yaosio	t1_dgnj1t9

As in, having to do with the two hundred and fifty thousand years during which the tribe was the primary form of human organization. I can't help but suspect that the Chief and Shaman of the previous human epoch aren't really that different than the Queen and Pope of the current one. Of course they are at completely different scales of magnitude (which I consider a critique of civilization; the more things change, the more they stay the same) but other than a change of shape I am convinced that ten thousand years of agriculturally-based civilization, some .04% of human existence, has not beat the Chief and Shaman out of us just yet.     &gt;Like the butt of Dr. Johnson’s joke that much may be made of a Scotsman if he be caught young, a late-Palaeolithic child snatched from a campfire and raised among us now would have an even chance at earning a degree in astrophysics or computer science.

From the first thing I googled listing traits of a narcissist because its early and I have to go to work in a few:  In order for a person to be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) they must meet five or more of the following  symptoms:  * Has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements)  * Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love  * Believes that he or she is “special” and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions)  * Requires excessive admiration      * Has a very strong sense of entitlement, e.g., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations  * Is exploitative of others, e.g., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own ends      * Lacks empathy, e.g., is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others      * Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her      * Regularly shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes  Source: https://psychcentral.com/disorders/narcissistic-personality-disorder-symptoms/  My girlfriend's father is an ndad and exhibits many traits similar to Trump.

t3_677v4p	t1_dgoif98	1493038217	Richard Nixon was not a narcissist.  He was a deeply insecure man who had a genius mind for the political game.  He rose to power on little but his wit, and lived every day in fear that the true powerful elite would take it all away at any minute.  Ironically it was his own paranoia that was his downfall.   Trump is just an idiot puppet of Putin and big business and likely has dementia.  He'd be more aptly compared to Ronald Reagan than to Richard Nixon.

t3_677v4p	t1_dgoj5nl	1493039428	I kind of feel sorry for Nixon. He was a poor boy from a broken home who truly rose on his own. Got offered a full ride scholarship to Harvard and had to turn it down because his family needed him at home. Busted his ass despite continual contempt by his social betters. Was basically exploited by Dwight Eisenhower to be his attack dog as Vice President while being given almost no access or any real power. Constantly condescended to by the president and his wife, who saw themselves as socially above the Nixons.   Runs against JFK, a rich boy who had everything handed to him exactly how he wanted it and lost in incredibly dodgy fashion. Considered to have handily won their debate by people listening on the radio, but had to pay the ugly tax and lost among people watching it on TV.   Finally reaches the apex of power he had sought for so long (amid dirty circumstances involving Vietnam) and turned out to be a pretty good president. Were it not for the neuroses inflicted on him by a lifetime of pain and discrimination by people who thought they were better than him, he would have probably gone down as a highly respected leader. Instead, he's Tricky Dick, who disgraced the office.	TheNotoriousAMP	t1_dgoif98
t3_677v4p	t1_dgok3ef	1493040818	&gt;turned out to be a pretty good president.  Some good, a lot bad. Nixon was an equal opportunity offender.

You want a President who is competent when his aim is to defend the country and uphold the law and the Constitution, but when his single-minded goal is to consolidate power in his person no matter the law or the cost, competence naturally uses the very necessary latitude of the office in a perverse way.	yeesCubanB	t1_dgoj5nl

As support for this, he misleadingly cites Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution, which makes no such general assertion, but instead lists those benefits as a reason for the government to be permitted to enforce of copyrights and other intellectual-property laws:  &gt; [The Congress shall have power] To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.	knox3	t3_679yak
t3_679yak	t1_dgosbe7	1493050608	Snarky and stoopid, but in this case technically correct.  Nye implied that science funding was enshrined in the Constitution.  But,  To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, (*". . .by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.*”) was truncated in his speech.  As the article correctly states, ". . . The Copyright Clause has nothing to do with government-funded science, but everything to do with establishing a legal framework to protect intellectual property rights."  EDIT: Those crying "fake news" or "downvote" miss the whole point of Nye's scientific mission.  This is actually a horribly-written but essentially accurate opinion piece, and I believe Nye would agree that in the referenced context, he misrepresented the intent of the Copyright Clause of the US Constitution.	allenahansen	t3_679yak

It worked for the hole in the ozone, and I think that is the only real example of trying to making a change like this. Could stopping climate change be done by corporations or individuals? Sure it's possible, but it's much harder.	RobToastie	t1_dgorltc

Would my refusal to serve result in the death/injury/or ostracization of myself or my family?   I'd like to think I would still have a similar moral compass to what I have now but in my voluntary service, I've met people who still do this for "god n country" and use their religion to justify awful treatment of the other side(s).  I was trying to make an argument on the side of the Geneva Conventions, that hold a soldier cannot be held accountable for following lawful orders. Obviously, genocide is not lawful, nor would any reasonable person hold that it is, but if I had been told I'm defending my homeland, without the benefit of knowing that I'm actually part of the invading force, I probably would fight to "save slavery" (because to me, thanks to my upbringing, they wouldn't be people).	justablur	t1_dgox42j

It was a good deal for almost everyone, even the U.S. (though, as per our usual stance, enforcement was lax)  Japan becomes the biggest fish in the pond, however, and wants to avoid China taking up the oxygen and become a regional leader.  This is Abe's way of telling us that the era of Japanese non-militarization and U.S. dominance is over. Expect a constitutional rework in the next 10 years.  Edit: Reading the article, my bet is that Japan will test the waters of actually partnering with China at APEC. RCEP is unacceptable for them. It'll be very cursory, but it'll be floated, no doubt. They'll probably push it through no matter what, and sit on it until the next reasonable U.S. admin comes in and they'll offer membership to the U.S. on severely worse terms. No matter what, Japan wins.	DickButtwoman	t3_67byde
t3_67byde	t1_dgp8jdo	1493068286	Withdrawing from TPP was a huge mistake. It would have had a negligible effect on job loss, would've helped raise environmental/labor/human rights standards in Asia, and would have given the US greater influence. Even China was willing to, in the medium term, start the process of complying with TPP standards in order to join down the road. This would have been a net win for everyone.  Instead, my money says we see a version that doesn't include the same level of environmental and human rights protections, and American soft power in Asia will be weakened. Or, even worse, China will out maneuver Japan and RCEP will stay as the trade agreement of choice for Asia.   What a wasted opportunity by the US.	1shmeckle	t3_67byde
t3_6765tp	t1_dgp9c3k	1493069241	I mean...I've spent some time on Drudge, Brietbart, Fox News, and Infowars...I'm not sure how people complaining about the media hold that garbage up as a viable alternative...it takes the " hypersensitive, fear mongering, sensationalist bullshit " to dizzying heights...maybe you just like sensationalized 'news' you agree with?

t3_67byde	t1_dgpc6df	1493072746	Yea that Bernie Sanders must be a Russian shill for opposing a deal that expanded the powers of the corporate class above everyone else.	Apathetic_Zealot	t1_dgpbhux
t3_67byde	t1_dgpcmgn	1493073321	Do you have evidence for saying that it expanded the powers of the corporate class? Considering the language of TPP did not drastically differ from the hundreds of bilateral trade agreements that already existed between those countries, it would be useful to know in what way TPP would have expanded those powers. If you're referring to the ISDS provisions, how would those have differed from the already existing ISDS provisions in those prior agreements?	1shmeckle	t1_dgpc6df
t3_67byde	t1_dgpdotv	1493074718	Here's the [official statement](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/the-trans-pacific-trade-tpp-agreement-must-be-defeated?inline=file) from Sanders about it.  But [here](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/why-tpp-bad-deal-america-and-american-workers/) is a more detailed source with more proper citations. It is the last of 6 entries talking about the TPP.

t3_67byde	t1_dgpdvyn	1493074979	If you're an advocate for IP reform, this isn't the hill you die on. Unfortunately, even if TPP was passed or not, WIPO exists and will continue to exist.	DickButtwoman	t1_dgpdq39
t3_67byde	t1_dgpfrst	1493077460	So Sanders' stuff is pretty much boiler plate opposition to trade agreements. I've seen Stiglitz's arguments before and he sets out good reasons to oppose TPP, though most of his points can be disputed by someone who is well versed in international economic law. Numerous economists who study trade agreements also disagree with his assessment - Nina Pavcnik, for example, can't come to anywhere near as confident of a conclusion as Stiglitz on the effect on jobs because, if we're being intellectually honest, it is really damn hard to make such broad determinations with so many variables. Other researchers, like Yale's Susan Franck, have also shown that there isn't much effect on foreign direct investment when bilateral agreements are signed (generally by at the point investment is already happening, so most jobs would have been lost prior to the signing of a treaty). Stiglitz himself doesn't really provide any evidence of how TPP specifically would cause that damage. So, for example, his citation to Acemoglu, et al., about the effect of imports is in regard to China - a country we actually don't have any bilateral or multilateral trade/investment agreements with. Much of the damage people are afraid of already happened or will happen regardless of TPP. So we don't get a true sense from Stiglitz of how TPP itself would change what is already happening.  Regardless, nothing Stiglitz writes actually addresses your specific claim that it would *expand* the powers of the corporate class. I'm assuming when you say expand you mean that there were a set of powers that existed before and if TPP passed this class would have greater powers. Yet, there doesn't seem to be anything unique about who writes, interprets, and executes TPP compared to any prior trade agreement. Nor is there anything unique about the provisions. That may itself be a reason to oppose TPP or to write different trade agreements, but I still see no evidence of your claim that it expands "the powers of the corporate class above everyone else."	1shmeckle	t1_dgpdotv
t3_67byde	t1_dgpg8pz	1493078083	By expand I more meant scope of influence. It may be similar to other large trade deals, but that in itself is still a a problem when looking at who benefits the most from these trade deals. As it has been true in the past it's been the already wealthy.	Apathetic_Zealot	t1_dgpfrst
t3_67byde	t1_dgpghox	1493078409	You know, you might have had an argument if this was treaty 2 or 3 where the WIPO rules were extended and enshrined, but those rules have been enshrined in every major treaty the world over in which a WIPO member state was making deals related to IP. That has to be at least 20 treaties that the U.S. has been a part of.  If you want to fight U.S. IP expansionism, then fighting the 20th of 20 treaties in which the WIPO rules are extended isn't going to help. You need to either fight U.S. IP rules or fight WIPO's very existence by advocating for renegotiation talks. That's not going to happen if resources are spent fighting tangential treaties.  And let's be clear, the WIPO rules aren't the source of most of the U.S.'s problems with current IP laws. There's nothing in there about baseline years IP protection must be extended. There's also nothing in there forcing fair use claims to be affirmative defenses rather than remedies upon counter-notice under the DMCA. Those are U.S. laws which, surprise surprise, don't exist in other WIPO compliant territories.  Now, I have spent an inordinate amount of time in my legal career studying two treaties that are currently dead, and I can tell you, I have problems with TPP. None of them are IP related. I also think IP laws in this country are fucked, but not un-salvageable, and the underlying system itself is the best we're going to get. There's no end to the amount of times I've watched a professor or some other expert jibe an upstart with the question 'can you describe a better system?' There is none. These ideas have been literally considered since the renaissance, and many options have been tried, with many failing.  The general response from those upstarts (I would know, I used to be one of them) is always about either fair use affirmative defenses or lowering the years IP protection is afforded to copyright holders, and providing forced royalties exceptions for medical patents. Those are tweaks, not explosions of the system.	DickButtwoman	t1_dgpe4fp

My worry was that this would hit home with his base and actually galvanize support among them.  Granted, in either situation he looks super week to moderates or anyone looking objectively at the situation, but at least the "not shutdown the government" option is the more responsible of the two.	cr42	t1_dgpiajr

I'm also American and, as far as TPP is concerned, I think American interests are what matters when deciding whether we should sign it. But in the case of trade agreements generally, if we're arguing about whether they are good only for wealthy people the answer isn't that clear.   Nor would I call China's achievement a low bar.  500 million people moving from absolute poverty is a *miracle* that no one imagined prior to the 1990s. For perspective, this makes up roughly 70% of the entire total of people who left absolute poverty between 1990 and 2010. The other 30%? Mainly India and East/South East Asian countries that liberalized their economies and signed a shit ton of trade agreements.	1shmeckle	t1_dgpkyvc
t3_67byde	t1_dgpm8kc	1493085821	The low bar comment is more talking about how even though yes they've raised millions above the official poverty line, being slightly above the poverty line working in sub par labor conditions and other aspects of the wild west that is the Chinese economy is not desirable for Americans. So sure, for countries with much to gain and little to lose like India and China these deals are an overall boost. But for Americans within an established economy these deals do not seem to benefit the majority of us.	Apathetic_Zealot	t1_dgplul6

t3_6765tp	t1_dgpte63	1493096565	Because, by far, the dominating voice in the media is left. It's not at all an even playing field. Plus, no one pretends outlets like the Drudge Report or Brietbart are objective. CNN, Washington Post, PolitiFact, people reference these outlets like they're non-partisan, but they're not.  By saying "Trump is perfect," I didn't mean that he was a perfect politician, I meant that his attitude and behavior are exactly what is needed in this insane political climate. We need a politician who won't bow down and apologize when the media goes ape shit over a trivial gaffe or not using preferred wording. We need someone who is able to damper big government, excessive handouts, reduce regulation, and not pander to the organized activists who fight back. He is apparently immune to controversy, and so when the media spins what he does into "he's a moron" or "he's a fascist" or "he's going to start World War 3," it's​ like they're beating their fists against a brick wall. And in a few years, when people realize that there's been no economic fallout, no foreign policy disasters, no internment camps and no nuclear holocaust, people will realize just how full of shit the mainstream media is.	gary_f	t1_dgp9c3k

Scientists even signing up for office and getting involved in politics like never before in history. Add to that the historically low approval ratings and one might think 2020 is an easy race for Democrats to win. Wanted to post this to be a kind reminder that one has only won the elections when one has actually won them. 2020 might seem as a certain win for Democrats to some, but think about this; the first 100 days haven't been great for the incumbent President, to put it mildly, yet his base hasn't crumbled that much and *almost all* of the Trump voters don't regret having voted for him. If Democrats want some of the Trump voters back on their side, they need to do more than just letting Trump do whatever he does.	Leocto	t1_dgpucmp
t3_67en0u	t1_dgpuv4x	1493099628	Trump won the election in november by 74 electoral college votes. If it was held again today, he'd win by a margin of ~140. The democrats are infighting more than his famously unruly base, and he's retained almost complete support from his voters, who are enough to win again in 2020. Democrats aren't going to win 2020 by proclaiming how inevitable and guaranteed their win is. They tried the 'too big to fail' approach in 2016.  I want the democrats to win in 2020, but only if they're willing to do what it takes to earn that win: Move the party back to the center, embrace the populist anti-globalist and anti-immigration sentiments, denounce the nutwings and campaign on fixing healthcare and the economy.  Their current strategy is "Move the party further left. Try to explain to people that globalism is a positive good and should be embraced. Try to explain to people that muslim immigrants are wonderful people and should be embraced. Try to explain that hate speech isn't free speech and defend the violent resistance. Try to explain that obamacare is good and needs to be preserved even as premiums skyrocket at +50-100% in a single year and half the country only has a single insurer left in its market. Don't mention the economy at all because they've seen the economy polling figures from the election.  I liked the old democratic party of FDR, Stevenson, Wellstone.

If championing the hard working americans against the globalist elite is now an entry level conservative talking point, then the democratic party died in Wellstone's burning wreck   If the democrats run a candidate in 2020 who wants to replace the broken Obamacare with universal healthcare, protect our domestic markets at the expense of multinational corporation profits and economic migrants, says political violence is wrong and free speech is a fundamental right and champions the working class and can walk into a room full of Trump supporters in the rural south and win them over, that's how Trump will lose 2020. I'm not sure if I can think of any politicians that fit that bill. Nothing comes to mind. No sir, nobody at all.  Course, at the rate they're going, they'll run elizabeth warren, she'll win the primaries in a landslide, her #1 campaign issue will be social justice for transgender muslims, and Trump will win 49 states and lose california by a few points even after the october 2020 massacre of red hat martyrs in berkeley.

t3_67en0u	t1_dgpvmdf	1493101426	Protectionism is not the way to go. Globalization is a net good for any country that chooses to embrace it. The problems only come when working people allow immigrants to be scapegoated as the root of all their problems when the real issue is that the massive profits that come from a globalized economy are not enjoyed to some degree by all members of the workforce (done through tax havens, "trickle down", austerity etc.). Immigration is a centuries-long fact of life in the United States. It doesn't suddenly become evil once our families make it here. Other than those two points I'm inclined to agree with you.

Its great for business. Unfortunately, that "net good" doesn't apply to the american workers, who have seen [total wage stagnation](https://thecurrentmoment.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/productivity-and-real-wages.jpg) since globalism kicked into high gear in the 70's, despite booming economies. Then we're in on the brink of a looming employment crisis, as low skill workers have their jobs shipped overseas to mexican / bangladeshi factories and they get jobs in the service sector to pay the bills, and the high tech workers have their jobs replaced by imported indian H1B visa holders- 38% of tech workers in silicon valley already are foreign born- which has led to our college graduates of 2015-2016 have record rates of un/underemployment, again, largely in the service sector as cashiers and bartenders, cooks, etc- oh and that service sector market is being rapidly automated, workers in fast food places being replaced by robots as the minimum wage hits $15  Protectionism isn't a choice, its an inevitability. The ongoing implosion of the middle class isn't sustainable and will erupt one way or the other. Protectionism offers a way to rebuild the domestic workforce at the expense of corporate profits, the livelihoods of foreign workers and the risks of escalating trade wars. America's presence on the world stage will diminish as a result. Public dissatisfaction with the economy is an uncontrollable force, and if globalism can't be averted, it will probably plunge us into societal collapse around the same time china's senior citizens outnumber the workers and thats when you'd be wise to invest in a Pip Boy 2000 and supply of water chips.

t3_67en0u	t1_dgpwa95	1493103072	Protectionism has never been shown to work in any real capacity. We learned that the hard way with Smoot-Hawley during the Great Depression when it made things even worse. I'll need to see a source for college grad unemployment/underemployment hitting record highs last year as everything I can find says that was not the case.  Those low-level manufacturing jobs are also not coming back as automation is hitting that sector hard as well. Investing in the education and skillset of workers to move into new industries is what is ultimately needed, but you will not see that happening when split ticketers are voting a con man into the White House.  Globalization is the future; the nature of markets is to grow, and they always will. The thing that will make the USA lose its power status is if the population chooses to turn away from the rest of the world rather than work to establish their place in the new economy.

Its great for business. Unfortunately, that "net good" doesn't apply to the american workers,  Except, you know, the retailer, the consumer, or the importer. Or are those people not "workers" in your world? This might have sounded good in your head, but it isn't based in reality.  A good example of what I'm talking about is the steel tariff fiasco:  https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/06/01/us-steel-tariffs-against-china-are-working-americans-losing-jobs-becoming-poorer-as-a-result/#3670369b5303  &gt;&gt; As a result of a Section 201 (“safeguard”) investigation brought at the behest of the U.S. steel industry, President Bush in March 2002 imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel products for three years and one day. The tariffs, combined with other challenges present in the marketplace at the time and in the months that followed, boosted steel costs to the detriment of American companies that use steel to produce goods in the United States. The resulting negative impact included job losses for thousands of American workers. The Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition (CITAC) Foundation requested a formal examination of the impact of higher steel costs on American steel-consuming industries,1 and in particular, a quantification of employment losses at those companies.   &gt;&gt; This study employed straight-forward and widelyaccepted regression analysis using a variety of price and employment data to maximize the reliability of the results.2 We found that: • 200,000 Americans lost their jobs to higher steel prices during 2002. These lost jobs represent approximately $4 billion in lost wages from February to November 2002.3 • One out of four (50,000) of these job losses occurred in the metal manufacturing, machinery and equipment and transportation equipment and parts sectors. • Job losses escalated steadily over 2002, peaking in November (at 202,000 jobs), and slightly declining to 197,000 jobs in December.4 • More American workers lost their jobs in 2002 to higher steel prices than the total number employed by the U.S. steel industry itself (187,500 Americans were employed by U.S. steel producers in December 2002).   A lot of US imports = raw materials and then those materials are used to finish products in the united states, many jobs here depend on this.   This isn't even getting into the fact trade isn't where most jobs went.  https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.15.1.125  &gt;&gt; But research shows that the automation of U.S. factories is a much bigger factor than foreign trade in the loss of factory jobs. A study at Ball State University's Center for Business and Economic Research last year found that trade accounted for just 13 percent of America's lost factory jobs. The vast majority of the lost jobs — 88 percent — were taken by robots and other homegrown factors that reduce factories' need for human labor.  &gt;&gt; "We're making more with fewer people," says Howard Shatz, a senior economist at the Rand Corp. think tank. General Motors, for instance, now employs barely a third of the 600,000 workers it had in the 1970s. Yet it churns out more cars and trucks than ever.  &gt;&gt; In a survey by the consulting firm Deloitte, global manufacturing executives predicted that that the United States — now No. 2 — will overtake China as the most competitive country in manufacturing by 2020. (Competitiveness is measured by such factors as costs, productivity and the protection of intellectual property.) The Reshoring Initiative, a nonprofit that lobbies manufacturers to return jobs to the United States, says America was losing an average of 220,000 net jobs a year to other countries a decade ago. Now, the number being moved abroad is roughly offset by the number that are coming back or being created by foreign investment.  So the idea that protectionism is going to bring back obsolete jobs is sketchy.    &gt;&gt; Protectionism isn't a choice, its an inevitability. The ongoing implosion of the middle class isn't sustainable and will erupt one way or the other. Protectionism offers a way to rebuild the domestic workforce at the expense of corporate profits  Protectionism does not come at the expense of corporate profits, it comes at the expense of the consumer and every other sector of the economy.  &gt;&gt; since globalism kicked into high gear in the 70's, despite booming economies. Then we're in on the brink of a looming employment crisis, as low skill workers have their jobs shipped overseas to mexican / bangladeshi factories and they get jobs in the service sector to pay the bills, and the high tech workers have their jobs replaced by imported indian H1B visa holders- 38% of tech workers in silicon valley already are foreign born- which has led to our college graduates of 2015-2016 have record rates of un/underemployment, again, largely in the service sector as cashiers and bartenders, cooks, etc- oh and that service sector market is being rapidly automated, workers in fast food places being replaced by robots as the minimum wage hits $15  You seem to be operating on some questionable information.  http://www.budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2016/1/27/the-effects-of-immigration-on-the-united-states-economy  &gt;&gt; Has the surge in immigration since 1970 led to slower wage growth for native-born workers? Academic research does not provide much support for this claim. The evidence suggests that when immigration increases the supply of labor, firms increase investment to offset any reduction in capital per worker, thereby keeping average wages from falling over the long term. Moreover, immigrants are often imperfect substitutes for native-born workers in U.S. labor markets. That means they do not compete for the same jobs and put minimal downward pressure on natives’ wages. This might explain why competition from new immigrants has mostly affected earlier immigrants, who experienced significant reductions in wages from the surge in immigration. In contrast, studies find that immigration has actually raised average wages of native-born workers during the last few decades.  &gt;&gt; Immigrants are at the forefront of innovation and ingenuity in the United States, accounting for a disproportionately high share of patent filings, science and technology graduates, and senior positions at top venture capital-funded firms. In addition, the presence of immigrants often creates opportunities for less-skilled native workers to become more specialized in their work, thereby increasing their productivity.  &gt;&gt; A popular view is that immigrants are taking jobs from American citizens. However, although immigrants increase the supply of labor, they also spend their wages on homes, food, TVs and other goods and services and expand domestic economic demand. This increased demand, in turn, generates more jobs to build those homes, make and sell food, and transport TVs.  &gt;&gt; Most empirical studies indicate long-term benefits for natives’ employment and wages from immigration, although some studies suggest that these gains come at the cost of short-term losses from lower wages and higher unemployment. Standard economic theory implies that while higher labor supply from immigration may initially depress wages, over time firms increase investment to restore the amount of capital per worker, which then restores wages. Steady growth in the capital-labor ratio prevents workers’ average productivity, and therefore their average wages from declining over the long run. Figure 2 shows the pre-1980 trend in the capital-labor ratio extrapolated over the next few decades – the period when U.S. immigration accelerated. Consistent with the theory, the actual capital-labor ratio did not significantly or permanently deviate from that trend after 1980.  &gt;&gt; Despite these increases in labor supply, in many cases immigrants appear to complement American-born workers rather than replacing them. Because less-educated immigrants often lack the linguistic skills required for many jobs, they tend to take jobs in manual labor-intensive occupations such as agriculture and construction. Even for low-skilled native-born workers in these industries, the effects of increased competition from immigrants are ambiguous, as many take advantage of their superior communication abilities and shift into occupations where these skills are more valuable, such as personal services and sales. Similarly, highly educated immigrants face a disadvantage in communication-intensive jobs, and therefore tend to work in scientific and technical occupations. Highly skilled natives in management, media, and other culture- and language-dependent jobs face little competition from high skilled immigrants. The inflow of foreign labor is, therefore, concentrated in a subset of occupations that tend to employ many immigrants already. Consequently, it is earlier immigrants who face the greatest increase in competitive pressure.	pizzashill	t1_dgpvyhy

t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqgims	1493138602	I'll just repost this here from yet another of the many threads on this:  This is just a proxy issue for the underlying fight. The Democratic party establishment wants Bernie voters, mail lists and enthusiasm, but without the inconvenience of Bernie, who is, ahhh... not that fond of the party itself.  Immediately after the election, it seemed to many, including me, that the only way for the Democrats to come back from the hole they had dug themselves into (losing Legislatures and Governors in state after state, plus the constant erosion in DC) was to embrace the Bernie people.  Now the Inside The Beltway people, especially including the lobbyists (like Planned Parenthood) , seem to be betting that Trump will implode and take a bunch of Republicans down with him. It might be true, too. If so, they need Bernie supporters much less.  Couple that with Bernie's not-so-unifying national tour with Perez and we see the inevitable attempts to smear, malign and discredit him. It's par for the course, just normal bare knuckle politics that the Clintons have practiced for decades. (See the history of David Brock for further reference. It's all he does.)  TL; DR: This is the issue of the day in a fight between the DC Democrats and Bernie's appeal to a segment of the grassroots party. This issue is the excuse, not the reason.	NotCompletelyDumb	t3_67hmxs
t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqgjfg	1493138626	Ya like with Jon Ossoff, Bernie said he wasnt a progressive, but Ossoff is progressive on a lot of things.	readnweep	t1_dgqg7iy
t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqgkfq	1493138655	For 1, thank you for giving a better explanation. I will debate with you since you seem to understand boundaries.  Bernie, himself, has not cast himself as anything. All he's done is do what he has done for decades. Be honest, scandal free, and willing to help people.  People often prop him up because some of his overzealous, or loud, supporters will often "shine" him as such, but also because his platform is the most progressive in the country.  Now, about the compromise. I don't think that's a fair assessment of what is happening. The candidates that Bernie picked are, indeed, progressive candidates--but he will endorse someone if they have the best shot at winning. See: Thomas in Kansas, Ossoff in Georgia, Mello in Omaha. Out of those 3, only 1 is a "progressive", one is establishment, and the other is "mostly" progressive.  Bernie is being as pragmatic as he can right now, but he understands what needs to happen in the democratic party in order for it to win: It needs a message that can relate to the largest voting block in the country. The democrats refusing to support people that "aren't like them" (registered or not) is a losing strategy, and he sees this. He's been in the game long enough to see this happen more than once.  But again, most of what people have on Bernie are his supporters. Many are loud, many are wrong, but most of them just want a better future; not an incremental one.  &gt;claim that pragmatism is A-OK.  Lastly, this part is a bit off base. It isn't pragmatism that is the issue--it's accepting something different that's an issue. You should applaud Bernie supporters for finally being a bit pragmatic in candidates, and stop dealing in hypocrisy blows to oust him from the party. That kind of division will keep Republicans in office.	kyonu	t1_dgqg7iy

Controversy was manufactured after the fact in the first case; controversy was an obvious cause for very clear due process in the latter.

t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqhr13	1493139895	You're getting downvoted for the 'not even dems' comment.  Bernie's a dem under a different name, for all intents and purposes.  He doesn't like what they're doing, so he declines their nomination.  But he realizes he has to work within the party to get things done.	Hurricos	t1_dgqhc9h
t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqht0d	1493139954	How about Senator Bob Casey Jr., D-PA, who expressly opposes Roe v. Wade?  How about Tim Kaine, who helped pass - and signed into law - the *mandatory* ultrasound bill in Virginia (and made "choose life" license plates an option)?  Is that better than Heath "While my faith guides my personal views, as mayor I would never do anything to restrict access to reproductive health care" Mello, who [has the support of Nebraska abortion activists](https://www.thenation.com/article/why-was-heath-mello-thrown-under-the-bus/)?	Mallardy	t1_dgqg29u
t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqhv5r	1493140016	Okay.  I mean, I'm genuinely curious.  Because I've seen this idea passed around that Dems when to third parties in larger numbers, but I've never seen any data to support it.  Depressed turnout doesn't surprise me.	FreezieKO	t1_dgqho9p
t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqhyb7	1493140110	Well I personally met at least a few dems who voted for Trump because "Hillary cheated Bernie and she will only get us into wars." So it's not just bots out there...	tfirhcslegeipS	t1_dgqhv5r
t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqhztq	1493140155	&gt; Most importantly, Bernie's working with the Democratic Party now; this changes a whole lot. But to boot, Bernie's campaigning comes after the first round; Mello's opponent is strictly anti-abortion and will shut down PP Omaha, and Mello is the only one that can save them.  This is the most important part.  If you want a litmus test for pro-choice, that's okay.  But you have to run that test *during the primary*.  Now, the primary is over, and the choice is between a Dem and Rep.	FreezieKO	t1_dgqgwgg
t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqi0l2	1493140177	&gt; Bernie, himself, has not cast himself as anything. All he's done is do what he has done for decades. Be honest, scandal free, and willing to help people.  Sure, I'll give you his positions have stayed consistent.  But I think it's disingenuous to suggest Bernie hasn't positioned himself as more progressive than the next guy.  He absolutely questioned Hillary's progressive bona fides during the primaries, even if he frequently did so obliquely (i.e. by focusing on the Wall Street speeches).  He definitely pointed out her less-than-progressive prior positions on LGBT rights, without making any allowances for the political realities faced by the Clinton administration in the early 90s vs. his political reality as a Senator-for-life from a super liberal state.    The reason that bugs me is that Sanders sacrifices *nothing* by taking those liberal stands.  It's like a senator from Alabama being a hardcore conservative.  He's just giving his base what they want.  And to see him judge people for not committing political seppuku (i.e. by coming out in support of gay marriage in the early 90s) rankles.  &gt; People often prop him up because some of his overzealous, or loud, supporters will often "shine" him as such, but also because his platform is the most progressive in the country.  ...and that was the most frequent rationale I saw for Bernie's candidacy--that he was the only "real" progressive in the race.  And that's a totally legitimate basis to compare yourself to your opponent.  I just think it's inconsistent to throw that criteria out the window for candidates like Mello.  &gt; Now, about the compromise. I don't think that's a fair assessment of what is happening. The candidates that Bernie picked are, indeed, progressive candidates--but he will endorse someone if they have the best shot at winning. See: Thomas in Kansas, Ossoff in Georgia, Mello in Omaha. Out of those 3, only 1 is a "progressive", one is establishment, and the other is "mostly" progressive.  I keep seeing this stuff about Thompson--he seemed like a pretty down-the-line Bernie-style progressive to me.  And even though Bernie endorsed Ossoff, he didn't lift a finger to help him get elected (which he did do for Thompson and Mello).    &gt; Bernie is being as pragmatic as he can right now, but he understands what needs to happen in the democratic party in order for it to win: It needs a message that can relate to the largest voting block in the country.  And perhaps this is where the disconnect is.  Perhaps it's just a disagreement over strategy.  I think Bernie truly believes that his progressive message will appeal to the largest amount of people in the country.  That people in West Virginia and rural parts of Michigan and Ohio are just waiting for someone to propose big New Deal-style social programs before they will vote for Democrats.  I simply disagree with this.  I've spent a fair amount of time in the rural rust belt (my inlaws all live there), and I see a whole lot of working class white guys that are extremely conservative.  They don't trust the government, and they typically see large government spending programs as taking their tax dollars and giving them to the undeserving.  They believe this stuff *regardless of the specifics of the program*--once it's labeled as some kind of "welfare" plan they are dead set against it.  So I think it's really questionable that a full-on Bernie message is going to win back the parts of the country the Democrats just lost.  I believe that the lowest-common-denominator message, the one that is most likely to resonate with the largest swath of the voting public, is a centrist message.  Obama, for all his talk of hope and change, relentlessly cast himself as the reasonable guy in the middle ground.  I think that a Presidential candidate trying to craft a message that works in all 50 states needs to hew closer to the center, for the same reason that "The Big Bang Theory" gets better ratings than "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia."  It's a more boring, bland message, but it appeals to more people.  That doesn't mean Bernie's message won't work like gangbusters in some parts of the country.  I think it could really help Democrats flip red seats in blue states, for instance.  But I think it's a big mistake for the national party to get behind his message, because it's just too far to the left to win in some must-win parts of the US.  &gt; But again, most of what people have on Bernie are his supporters. Many are loud, many are wrong, but most of them just want a better future; not an incremental one.  And to people like me, who are perhaps a bit older and a bit more jaded than your average Bernie fan, the demand for "no incremental change" seems ahistorical, unrealistic, and highly unlikely to lead to anything positive.  Because most big progressive changes don't happen all at once.  Take Social Security for example.  It started as a very limited program for widows and orphans, but turned into one of the most successful large-scale social programs in the US.  Bernie logic would have said we shouldn't have passed the Social Security Act at all because it didn't go far enough.  But if we hadn't gone with that scaled-down bill, we likely would not have the retirement security we had today.    &gt; It isn't pragmatism that is the issue--it's accepting something different that's an issue. You should applaud Bernie supporters for finally being a bit pragmatic in candidates, and stop dealing in hypocrisy blows to oust him from the party.   If I heard more Bernie-or-busters admit that they were *wrong* to not support Hillary, maybe this would be a bit easier to take.  But when I see people continue to hold onto their anti-Hillary vitriol while on the other hand being willing to support someone like Mello, the hypocrisy is hard to take.	druuconian	t1_dgqgkfq
t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqi1y8	1493140216	Mello is more progressive than Hillary. His past anti-choice votes are concerning, but are they worse than fracking, AKA worsening climate change? Are they worse than having no staunch support against XL?  To say this guy is less progressive is like saying Trump is centrist.	kyonu	t1_dgqh4o0
t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqi2ox	1493140237	But let's assume this logic doesn't actually pertain to the media.  How do you stop this shit?  Do your due process, contact people like NARAL first, get a response from Mello and get more people on board.  It's like volunteer white-hat hacking.  You find the dirtiest opposition research you can on someone, and then compile it together and work with the candidate to fix it before it happens.	Hurricos	t1_dgqhztq
t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqi35a	1493140251	Exactly. Bernie never said he wasn't progressive, he said "I don't know if he's progressive" yet people keep changing his words to meet a narrative.	kyonu	t1_dgqgzkf
t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqi8mj	1493140412	&gt; Controversy was manufactured after the fact in the first case; controversy was an obvious cause for very clear due process in the latter. Bernie had to figure out what tactic he could use to get Hillary the support she needed to win - and he knew that selling out without a deal on the table would not have been that tactic.  Even if I give Bernie the benefit of the doubt that he was trying to help Hillary, I think he made a grave error in how he went about it.  I believe Bernie's whole Hamlet routine about endorsing Hillary hurt her tremendously.  It sent a loud-and-clear message to his supporters: Hillary Clinton is so uniquely awful that we can only support her after extracting loads of concessions.  It sent the message that his supporters ought to think long and hard about supporting the Democratic nominee because that nominee wasn't Bernie.  I believe it would have sent a better message if Bernie quickly and whole-heartedly endorsed Hillary.  He would have still received a lot of policy concessions, since Hillary's people would know they still had work to do to lock up his base.	druuconian	t1_dgqhf78

t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqiitx	1493140711	The criteria is being tossed out the window because he's fighting for the Dems now.  Bernie campaigned in Kansas in late February.  People being conservative may be true, but you can change that with community and by demonstrating how much small social / legislative programs help.  They may say they're conservative, but what do you think they're going to do when a volunteer free health clinic comes around, or when someone swoops in to try to protect their pensions from debt collection agencies repo'ing funds from a bankrupt coal industry?   It comes down to canvassing and building community and helping people.  You see people do what's right, and others will come to them and help them do what's right, or vote for them when it comes to a ballot bill on giving them a couple million in funding to continue to offer free health services.  You do realize the South was the bluest New Deal coalition, right?  And that Vermont was once deeply Republican?  ... in any case, it's more about the message than the candidate.  The message is about getting people to get up and fix the problems in their own communities, and not fear manipulation if they all do it together.  Compare creating a monopsony on cultural change, or a worker's union.  The problem with incremental change isn't that it's incremental; it's that supporting those who support it will refuse to go any further or adapt to new changes.    ... and Bernie or Busters that realized they were wrong simply don't comment out of shame ;|  People being aware of corruption and voting against its continuation is another great thing, and it's a huge threat to anyone in power.  There is nothing bad about returning power to scholars and people that are positively affected by businesses over businesses themselves; as long as those people are not unduly influenced by any individual entity, and as long as those people are searching for answers for their community, they will find the right solution.  But it takes community to do that.	Hurricos	t1_dgqi0l2

Bernie never said "I am more progressive". Pointing out policy that isn't progressive is not the same thing as comparing your progressiveness to theirs--it's pointing out that the democrats are not progressive when they say they are.  &gt;The reason that bugs me is that Sanders sacrifices nothing by taking those liberal stands. It's like a senator from Alabama being a hardcore conservative. He's just giving his base what they want. And to see him judge people for not committing political seppuku (i.e. by coming out in support of gay marriage in the early 90s) rankles.  Why does him not sacrificing anything seem important to you? Vermont was extremely conservative before Bernie Sanders. He met a lot of pushback, and had a lot of hate back in the day. He was able to communicate with them as human beings and get them to love him. Sounds more like a decent politician than anything.  &gt;...and that was the most frequent rationale I saw for Bernie's candidacy--that he was the only "real" progressive in the race. And that's a totally legitimate basis to compare yourself to your opponent. I just think it's inconsistent to throw that criteria out the window for candidates like Mello.  I mean, he *was* the only "real" progressive in the race. Hillary Clinton is an [Incrementalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incrementalism), not a progressive.  But, if you look at Mello's voting record, he is more progressive than Hillary Clinton's past and present. He is pro-life in person, but has no plans to disrupt women's reproductive care in office. The Mello team assured me of that in an e-mail conversation.  Despite that, he even endorsed Ossoff, who is not a progressive, because he has the best shot at winning. Again, accepting something that isn't perfect is an important role--one the DNC doesn't seem to want to respect.  &gt;I keep seeing this stuff about Thompson--he seemed like a pretty down-the-line Bernie-style progressive to me. And even though Bernie endorsed Ossoff, he didn't lift a finger to help him get elected (which he did do for Thompson and Mello).  I've had this conversation before, and I would like to see the results of your responses: Just as Bernie didn't campaign for Ossoff (hell, he didn't even know the guy during the time)... Why didn't the DNC support Thomson, or even Mello thus far? The DNC won't lift a finger for Bernie's candidates, even though it's his current job in the party to scout out candidates for us to support who have the best chance at winning.  We all agree he should have supported Ossoff sooner, but that just plays back to the whole "pointing fingers instead of changing" aspect.  &gt;I simply disagree with this. I've spent a fair amount of time in the rural rust belt (my inlaws all live there), and I see a whole lot of working class white guys that are extremely conservative. They don't trust the government, and they typically see large government spending programs as taking their tax dollars and giving them to the undeserving. They believe this stuff regardless of the specifics of the program--once it's labeled as some kind of "welfare" plan they are dead set against it. So I think it's really questionable that a full-on Bernie message is going to win back the parts of the country the Democrats just lost.  The one big thing that really brought people to Bernie was his honesty. I live in one of the most regressive areas in the country (rural Texas), and even people here liked Bernie. They all said he was honest, even if they disagree with him. The definitely wouldn't feel *bad* for voting for the guy. Many people, I heard, feel the same way in the Rust belt.  To that end, I don't think it's his message that would win them over. I think it would be his lack of negative discourse with his opponent, and his integrity that will win them over. Those types of people are huge on this stuff; something Trump had none of (but he wasn't Clinton, and Clinton gave them no reason to trust her.)  Even if the Rust Belt didn't accept Bernie ([which they did](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/9/1482366/-Hillary-v-Bernie-A-State-by-state-Speculative-Analysis) according to their votes, even when compared to General), Bernie's Message was still widely accepted by the most of the country, even many of Trump's supporters in other areas. I won't get into the debate of "he wouldn've won", but he definitely would have garnered more votes than Hillary did (I think it was like 13% or something democrats stayed home in general who voted in primaries)  My point is that his message wasn't a problem; his lack of presence on TV and the radio is most likely what hurt him (according to Harvard's study).  &gt;And to people like me, who are perhaps a bit older and a bit more jaded than your average Bernie fan, the demand for "no incremental change" seems ahistorical, unrealistic, and highly unlikely to lead to anything positive. Because most big progressive changes don't happen all at once.  I think the main reason that people are jaded by this is because it hasn't happened since FDR, and to a smaller degree, Kennedy. Every single president since then has been incremental left or incremental right, and no one has tried to make massive changes to the average person. Bernie, who was the only major candidate (besides Stein and Johnson, on different spectrums) who wanted massive change for *all* the people and not for the rich.  I don't know how most people feel about it, but I can imagine the fear and/or skepticism about such changes. But without such changes, we're not going to change much in nearly enough time. Even economists and political scientists mostly agreed.  &gt;Take Social Security for example. It started as a very limited program for widows and orphans, but turned into one of the most successful large-scale social programs in the US. Bernie logic would have said we shouldn't have passed the Social Security Act at all because it didn't go far enough. But if we hadn't gone with that scaled-down bill, we likely would not have the retirement security we had today.  wait, what is this "Bernie logic" you speak of? Just because the program was small when it started? Let me stop you for a moment. This isn't *Bernie logic*. Bernie logic would have done the same thing. SS was a massive program to poor people when it started. It was wildly successful because of how it helped people. That is something *Bernie logic* would have wanted, even if it was small, because it was a massive change in the way we handle poor families.  An example of incremental change is "Keep ACA, lower premiums a few percentage points, and add a few million more people on healthcare". All of which would happen within a period of 8 years. This doesn't help many people in enough time. In those 8 years, we'd spend close to a trillion dollars on healthcare--when every single year it is more expensive that what single payer would be. Doctors and Economic specialists agree single payer is the way forward, which would help *everyone* the same way SS does.  &gt;If I heard more Bernie-or-busters admit that they were wrong to not support Hillary, maybe this would be a bit easier to take. But when I see people continue to hold onto their anti-Hillary vitriol while on the other hand being willing to support someone like Mello, the hypocrisy is hard to take.  I honestly don't think it would do much. Because what if they admitted they were wrong... Would that mean they suddenly accept DNC policy? Probably not. They would still support Bernie's progressivism, which is something the DNC refuses to accept. This is a two way street--people need to stop attacking democrats on *every front*, and democrats need to stop being an *exclusive* party. Too many people whine about "being a democrat" when they aren't seeing the big picture. Both sides need to change.  See above about Mello.	kyonu	t1_dgqi0l2
t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqjmxw	1493141888	He is not actively trying to restrict abortion.  &gt; Mello told the Huffington Post that he would not restrict access to reproductive care as mayor.  He is not a saint.  He has voted in favor of 5 bills, 2009-2011, that restrict abortion in some way -- on none of which his vote mattered; as a matter of fact, all of them passed with about 80% yeas.  Doesn't excuse him for legislating his point of view.  What might help is his votes to help women get the care they need so they *don't* get pregnant in the first place by using his Appropriations committee seat to push for more Title X funding, but that's not really an absolution, is it?  There were still women that had to leave the state for, e.g., abortions for genetic deformations, and probably countless women in dire straits hampered by the need for a doc to be in the room for an exorbitant amount of time for mifepristone.

t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqk0tx	1493142293	&gt; This was in everyone's minds in any case. The primary was too hot to just toss to the voter without some tempering first.  I guess we will have to agree to disagree on that point.  I believe Sanders should have done his part and *immediately* told his supporters that stopping Donald Trump from becoming president is the 1st, 2nd, and 500th most important thing in this election.  That there's no contest here, Clinton is super obviously the superior choice.    I personally believe he didn't do that because he cared more about cultivating his own brand than making sure his party won in November.  It helps Bernie Sanders to be seen as the reluctant convert who extracted policy concessions.  It does not help the Democratic party.  &gt; I doubt he would have gotten policy concessions, or that people would have believed that Hillary was being honest about those policy concessions, or that Hillary's camp would have given enough of them.  Wasn't that the case anyway?  I mean for goodness sakes, Bernie got more policy concessions than any losing candidate in modern history.  There was an entire "Bernie night" at the convention, even though I can't seem to recall a "Hillary night" in 2008 or a "Howard Dean night" in 2004.    Despite all that, you still heard plenty of his fans claiming that Hillary was just lying and would rip her mask off and reveal herself to be a secret Republican the minute she got into office.  So if you get that either way, I fail to see why he shouldn't have sent the "of course you should support Hillary Clinton, you would be an insane person not to" message.  &gt; The problem that cannot be forgotten is that there were already a HUGE amount of third-party voters that only did so not because they thought Bernie was too good to pass up, but that Bernie cheated them and stabbed them in the back and sold out.

t3_67hmxs	t1_dgql59b	1493143479	&gt; Bernie never said "I am more progressive". Pointing out policy that isn't progressive is not the same thing as comparing your progressiveness to theirs--it's pointing out that the democrats are not progressive when they say they are.  Oh c'mon, isn't that just a little too cute?  Hillary Clinton was establishment Democrats personified.  And Bernie spent a lot of time unfavorably comparing the progressiveness of establishment Democrats to his own more-progressive agenda.    Sure, he did it obliquely, but to suggest there wasn't a pretty pointed policy critique of Hillary as being insufficiently progressive is just disingenuous in my view.  Just because he wasn't as loud or vitrolic as some of his supporters in making that case doesn't mean he wasn't making that case.  &gt; Why does him not sacrificing anything seem important to you? Vermont was extremely conservative before Bernie Sanders. He met a lot of pushback, and had a lot of hate back in the day. He was able to communicate with them as human beings and get them to love him. Sounds more like a decent politician than anything.  &gt; Why does him not sacrificing anything seem important to you? Vermont was extremely conservative before Bernie Sanders. He met a lot of pushback, and had a lot of hate back in the day. He was able to communicate with them as human beings and get them to love him. Sounds more like a decent politician than anything.  The sacrifice issue is important to me because I think it's unfair to attack someone like Hillary Clinton--who as part of her husband's administration had to please the much more conservative national general electorate in the 1990s--to someone sitting in a comfortable seat in a liberal state.  In other words, the fact that Bernie has made very liberal votes isn't evidence of his leadership or political courage.  He's just giving the people what they want.  Vermont has always had a decidedly liberal bent in modern history.  Sure, they elected some Republicans, but it was Republicans like Jim Jeffords--notorious moderate RINOs.  It hasn't voted for a Republican for president since 1988.    And certainly today Vermont is easily one of the most liberal states in the country.  It has a D+15 partisan voting index.    &gt; I mean, he was the only "real" progressive in the race. Hillary Clinton is an Incrementalist, not a progressive.  And that's really the nub of this debate.  Incrementalism refers to *tactics,* not ideology.  You can be a incrementalist and also be a progressive, or also be a hardcore conservative.  Incrementalism just refers to *how* we get to the desired goal, it is neutral as to what that desired goal is.  I believe you absolutely can be an incrementalist and a progressive.  Case in point: the ACA.  It was incremental progressive change.  It did not get us to 100% coverage.  It did not create a public option.  It left insurance companies in place.  But it indisputably moved the needle in a more progressive direction and led to concrete positive good for millions of people.  &gt; I've had this conversation before, and I would like to see the results of your responses: Just as Bernie didn't campaign for Ossoff (hell, he didn't even know the guy during the time)... Why didn't the DNC support Thomson, or even Mello thus far? The DNC won't lift a finger for Bernie's candidates, even though it's his current job in the party to scout out candidates for us to support who have the best chance at winning.  I go back and forth on the Thompson race honestly.  I live in Kansas, and believe me I would love to see more DNC and DCCC money pouring into our state.  But at the same time, I'm not at all convinced Thompson's race was winnable.  He was in an *extremely* Republican district and he lost by thousands of votes.  Maybe an infusion of DNC votes could have netted him a few thousand more votes, but he still would have lost.    If you're just going by objective numbers, KS-4 has a higher partisan vote index (R+15) than GA-6 (R+8).  So there are completely sound reasons, completely divorced from ideology, to target more resources at the latter than the former.    &gt; To that end, I don't think it's his message that would win them over. I think it would be his lack of negative discourse with his opponent, and his integrity that will win them over. Those types of people are huge on this stuff; something Trump had none of (but he wasn't Clinton, and Clinton gave them no reason to trust her.)  And here's where I'm more pessimistic: Bernie's image as the guy with integrity was partially a by-product of the fact that he wasn't viewed as a likely nominee.  There was no big coordinated negative campaign against Bernie.  Republicans are *masters* of assassinating character and telling ridiculous, over-the-top lies about their opponents.  And I think that's exactly what they would have done to Bernie: recognized that integrity and honesty are the keys to his appeal, and then engaged in a massive smear campaign targeted at his integrity and honesty (with a healthy assist from Mother Russia).    Just look at what they did to John Kerry.  There is no question that John Kerry in fact served honorably in Vietnam and is a goddamn war hero.  And yet Republicans managed to convince enough people that he was a traitorous secret agent of the VC to sink his chances of getting elected.  &gt; I think the main reason that people are jaded by this is because it hasn't happened since FDR, and to a smaller degree, Kennedy. Every single president since then has been incremental left or incremental right, and no one has tried to make massive changes to the average person. Bernie, who was the only major candidate (besides Stein and Johnson, on different spectrums) who wanted massive change for all the people and not for the rich.  And what did FDR have?  Massive congressional majorities and a massive financial crisis that primed many people to be willing to try something new.  I just don't see those conditions repeating under a President Bernie.  Even if he had gotten elected, there would have been more than enough Republicans to block everything he wanted to do.    &gt; wait, what is this "Bernie logic" you speak of? Just because the program was small when it started? Let me stop you for a moment. This isn't Bernie logic. Bernie logic would have done the same thing. SS was a massive program to poor people when it started. It was wildly successful because of how it helped people. That is something Bernie logic would have wanted, even if it was small, because it was a massive change in the way we handle poor families.  I guess it depends on how you define the goal then.  If your goal is "enact a program that helps widows and orphans" then sure, it looks great.  But if your goal is "retirement security for everyone" (i.e. the kind of big, sweeping goal that Bernie tends to favor) then the original Social Security program looks like a half-measure, a capitulation to the right.    &gt; Because what if they admitted they were wrong... Would that mean they suddenly accept DNC policy? Probably not. They would still support Bernie's progressivism, which is something the DNC refuses to accept. This is a two way street--people need to stop attacking democrats on every front, and democrats need to stop being an exclusive party. Too many people whine about "being a democrat" when they aren't seeing the big picture. Both sides need to change.  OK, I'm with you on that.  I don't mean to suggest that the mainstream of the party is always in the right or has no obligation to reach out to the more progressive wing.  But here's why I wish we had some prominent Bernie-or-busters admitting they were wrong:  This needs to be a 9/11 moment for Democrats.  Our "never again" moment.  We need *everyone* to agree that failing to coalesce around our party's nominee after the primary process is over is a recipe for disaster, for ripping up everything Democrats of every stripe hold dear.    That doesn't mean your ideology changes, or that you don't have every right to fight like hell for Bernie or Bernie-style candidates in future primaries.  But it does mean that if the Bernie-style candidate loses, nobody should be thinking about voting for Jill Stein.  I worry that a not-insignificant chunk of progressives has become too ideological to make these kinds of pragmatic decisions.  And the end result of that is stuff like Donald Trump being our president.	druuconian	t1_dgqjgyo

t3_67hmxs	t1_dgqlkyg	1493143940	RE: Concessions -- well, look, I won't praise Hillary for her campaigning optics.  The problem is you're not much in the communities where those people flipped out and cursed the party when it happened.  Physical as well as online; there was a lot of outrage at the time, particularly seeing Bernie signs vandalized in Burlington and Williston when he capitulated.  There was a lot of anger, and a lot of people just not wanting to take part in the system any more because of what had gone on - so, coming from his point of view, no, I don't think he guessed he could have done much better at all.  But let's take a look:  You still heard plenty of accusations of selling out, but I should stress that this is not the main issue: most of the conversion from Sanders to Trump happened [during the Big Tuesdays. ](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=Sellout%20Sanders,Bernie%20would%20have%20won,Voting%20Sanders%20Trump)  The speculation that Sanders folks would turn to Trump during the DNC was little; Sanders sold out more than people turned to Trump.  The problem was not with Sanders selling out; it was with Sanders losing the vote in the first place, and apparently being cheated out of it.  The fact that he ran and lost - with a relatively disorganized and extra-establishment campaign, no doubt - is what turned voters to Trump; yet it was entirely in his right to run a campaign.  When people were gone, there was no bringing them back.  He assumed people would have sense, but too few people were still on the train to believe what he had to say, and when the e-mails finally came down, it appeared to a lot of people that he had just completely sold out, and it reflected in [T_D's](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=Sellout%20Sanders,Voting%20Sanders%20Trump,The_Donald) curves.  The problem was not Bernie not campaigning hard enough for Hillary.  The problem was Bernie actually trying to win while he still was far in the clear -- remember, after the south he had a pretty long pathway and had many ways he could have won - but before those holes had started to close, it was already far too late for Hillary.

First, that many Democrats - including the 2016 Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee - have pushed for as many or more abortion restrictions than Heath Mello.  Second, that Heath Mello is supported by abortion rights activists in Nebraska, and has specifically stated that *he has no intention of restricting access to reproductive health care as mayor*. Which, you know, is a tacit acceptance of the status quo that you say has "worked perfectly".  So you're ignoring Heath Mello's actual position, *and* the actual positions of other Democrats.

Just because he wasn't as loud or vitrolic as some of his supporters in making that case doesn't mean he wasn't making that case.  He wasn't directly hitting Hillary, he was hitting establishment politics. This isn't a new thing though--and this certainly isn't tied to Hillary. He's been hitting establishment politics since *before* he was in public office. He was protesting establishment politics in college even (and was arrested for protesting segregation). To that end, his rhetoric wasn't aimed at Hillary, but at the direction of the democratic party in general. It's been going right since after Kennedy brought it back left, and so far has no signs of stopping. A lot of that has to do with inclusion of corporations into the party.  &gt;The sacrifice issue is important to me because I think it's unfair to attack someone like Hillary Clinton--who as part of her husband's administration had to please the much more conservative national general electorate in the 1990s--to someone sitting in a comfortable seat in a liberal state. In other words, the fact that Bernie has made very liberal votes isn't evidence of his leadership or political courage. He's just giving the people what they want.

It hasn't voted for a Republican for president since 1988.   &gt;And certainly today Vermont is easily one of the most liberal states in the country. It has a D+15 partisan voting index.  Well that's the thing though. Vermont was a conservative majority when Bernie took office in 1981, and the state was a conservative majority (for local elections) for a good portion of that. At the time he was elected, Bernie fought against pushback from gun groups, religious groups, even blue-collar groups as being "socialist". After enacting policies that helped positive growth within the state, people grew on him.  To me, that's walking the walk. I don't know how you view it, especially since Clinton has been in the game for far less time than Bernie, but I can guarentee you that the situations and sacrifices have been very different. I won't try to change your mind on the sacrifice, but to say that Bernie's sacrifice wouldn't be *enough* is kind of a nit-pick that shouldn't really matter.  &gt;And that's really the nub of this debate. Incrementalism refers to tactics, not ideology. You can be a incrementalist and also be a progressive, or also be a hardcore conservative. Incrementalism just refers to how we get to the desired goal, it is neutral as to what that desired goal is.   &gt;I believe you absolutely can be an incrementalist and a progressive. Case in point: the ACA. It was incremental progressive change. It did not get us to 100% coverage. It did not create a public option. It left insurance companies in place. But it indisputably moved the needle in a more progressive direction and led to concrete positive good for millions of people.  We probably can go back and forward on this all day, I just don't feel Incrementalism, when running for office, should be synonymous, or even attached to, Progressivism. Progressives favor large jumps forward with the ability to work backwards. Incrementalism makes minute changes that take a long time--and time is something we're running out of.  Lets look at your ACA example. You say it moved the needle left--but did it? Insurance companies got a much larger payday than before, and many people, such as myself, saw out premiums rise quicker than they used to (mine jumped from just $70 a month to $170). Some say it was going up anyways, but no reports are 100% Accurate on how quickly. I like ACA, but including corporations was a big mistake; one I think was a centrist move, not a leftist move.  Especially since ACA costs so much, and ALL estimates for Single payer are below that, it pains me to think of ACA as "efficient" or even "progressive" at all when the single payer option exists. I can almost guarantee if Hillary championed single payer, she would have garnered pretty much all of Bernie's lost support, many of the Bernie-to-Trumpers, and even Stein supporters.  &gt;I go back and forth on the Thompson race honestly. I live in Kansas, and believe me I would love to see more DNC and DCCC money pouring into our state. But at the same time, I'm not at all convinced Thompson's race was winnable. He was in an extremely Republican district and he lost by thousands of votes. Maybe an infusion of DNC votes could have netted him a few thousand more votes, but he still would have lost.  &gt;If you're just going by objective numbers, KS-4 has a higher partisan vote index (R+15) than GA-6 (R+8). So there are completely sound reasons, completely divorced from ideology, to target more resources at the latter than the former.  I hear that a lot about that district. But out of the 120,897 people that voted, we only needed 8500 more people to vote. The district has over 380,000 registerd voters, which means 259,000 registered voters did not vote. I absolutely believe DNC and DCCC support could have brought 8500 more people to vote.  &gt;And here's where I'm more pessimistic: Bernie's image as the guy with integrity was partially a by-product of the fact that he wasn't viewed as a likely nominee. There was no big coordinated negative campaign against Bernie.  &gt;Republicans are masters of assassinating character and telling ridiculous, over-the-top lies about their opponents. And I think that's exactly what they would have done to Bernie: recognized that integrity and honesty are the keys to his appeal, and then engaged in a massive smear campaign targeted at his integrity and honesty (with a healthy assist from Mother Russia).  &gt;Just look at what they did to John Kerry. There is no question that John Kerry in fact served honorably in Vietnam and is a goddamn war hero. And yet Republicans managed to convince enough people that he was a traitorous secret agent of the VC to sink his chances of getting elected.  I see this argument a lot, so lets put a few things up in there air.  The biggest thing the Republicans have on Bernie is his "socialist" tag. They'll try to play that into the ground, but really--when was the last time that worked? It really never has. In fact, the last time it worked, was when Truman called Wallace a communist (similarly to how the Clinton campaigned tried against Bernie). That attack doesn't work. I'm not saying GOP won't try, it just won't work.  Bernie's rape-fantasy article deal. This was a "nothing burger" as well, but Republicans would love to play that card. But against Trump? That card would be thrown right back at his face thanks to his ex wife.  Him spending time in Russia to diffuse nuclear weapons in Yugoslav? I'm sure these Russian probe allegations would fit Trump well.  Most of the things the GOP have on Bernie, they are literally accused of doing themselves, and that would have hurt him in the long run, especially seeing how mahy Trump supporters would have voted for Bernie.  As for Kerry, poor man, he just didn't have the message. A war hero won't get you far with Democrats, and I honestly don't think his policy was pushed well enough, nor did he have the history enough, to make it through the democrats. Bernie was nothing like Kerry.  &gt;And what did FDR have? Massive congressional majorities and a massive financial crisis that primed many people to be willing to try something new. I just don't see those conditions repeating under a President Bernie. Even if he had gotten elected, there would have been more than enough Republicans to block everything he wanted to do.  Its impossible to tell really, as predictions are all over the place, but he has earned a lot of support in congress, and a democratic party denying him of the votes would hurt the party anyways based on their current ideology. I probably won't continue this part of the debate because there are no certainties, and it's too easy to assume something.  &gt;I guess it depends on how you define the goal then...  I don't think that is the case. Bernie tends to favor big goals, but not all of his goals are that big. Social Security, though small, is something Bernie would have favored, because he isn't just a "go big or go home" candidate, he's a common sense candidate. Which is something Hillary laughed at, and tried to steal from him.  &gt;This needs to be a 9/11 moment for Democrats...  &gt;That doesn't mean your ideology changes...  I agree with you there, but this doesn't guarantee, and the DNC definitely wouldn't guarantee, that the message of the party would change. If all the Bernie-or-Busters told the DNC, right now, that "you were right, we should have voted for Hillary", the DNC then will accept it's *current*, failing message as "correct" and will see no reason to change course. Bernie will then get dropped from Outreach because the DNC will find this as a victory.  Call me pessimistic about the party, I just don't see them changing in any way, which is why the "progressive" message is so important to so many people. If the dems won't change their message even a little bit, those people will feel left out by the party, and the party will continue to tell its supporters they are correct, and the battle goes on and on.  The first step would be the party accepting a message that is favorable to the largest voting block, and then I can almost guarantee you that people will start pouring back in. I just don't think the DNC will do that.	kyonu	t1_dgql59b

His nature is like the flame; he is like Eros, but a God; Eros is only a daimon (Carl Jung, The Red Book).	course_not	t1_dgqt812

I remember laughing at him during the primaries (you know, I actually observe his full-context direct-source behavior instead of waiting for Rachel Maddow or Tucker Carlson to tell me how to think), while more reasonable politicians like Rubio and Kasich earned a few snickers but not such riotous disbelief and amusement as this guy. Listening to him try to explain the nuclear triad was horrifying/hilarious. Boy, my amusement faded when he won.  When the media calls a spade a spade...I'm not sure what I'm missing here. If anything the media has been alarmingly lenient on plenty of what he says. His call for WAR CRIMES on the campaign trail should have been dominating the news cycles for weeks. I don't believe it is hyperbole to say that he has about a 6th grade understanding of science, foreign policy, and history, and that was not hammered enough. None of this is remotely normal, but it's being aggressively normalized on all but the most left-wing publications. Most outlets switched topics once they felt people had lost interest and ad revenue was at risk. Thankfully Trump is enough of a trainwreck to serve them up something fresh each day. It's not a liberal conspiracy...it's just about money dude.  "he's a fascist"  I can't think of a mainstream news source that touted that line (at least directly - CNN would bring up how spooky his speeches/rallies were, for example), but there's a reason liberals are losing their minds over his words...it is not a stretch that he is making some ASTOUNDINGLY authoritarian claims and threats. His disinformation is a hallmark of autocrats and his bold lies about easily verifiable things show contempt for an informed electorate, which is the basis for a healthy democracy.  Thank God we have some checks and balances on a man who has nothing but (by turns) ignorance and disdain for them and his personal accountability.	davidsakh	t1_dgpte63

Also, you're wrong.  http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/7-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-u-s-supreme-court  &gt;&gt; The U.S. Constitution established the Supreme Court but left it to Congress to decide how many justices should make up the court. The Judiciary Act of 1789 set the number at six: a chief justice and five associate justices. In 1807, Congress increased the number of justices to seven; in 1837, the number was bumped up to nine; and in 1863, it rose to 10. In 1866, Congress passed the Judicial Circuits Act, which shrank the number of justices back down to seven and prevented President Andrew Johnson from appointing anyone new to the court. Three years later, in 1869, Congress raised the number of justices to nine, where it has stood ever since. In 1937, in an effort to create a court more friendly to his New Deal programs, President Franklin Roosevelt attempted to convince Congress to pass legislation that would allow a new justice to be added to the court—for a total of up to 15 members—for every justice over 70 who opted not to retire. Congress didn’t go for FDR’s plan.	pizzashill	t1_dgrpfr6

He controlled the outcome especially if McConnell knew something the rest of us didn't, [***it be even more unethical.***](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/12/10/mitch_mcconnell_prevented_stronger_action_against_russian_election_meddling.html) They wanted the people to decide.

Of course it's completely speculation at this point, but after what we just went through with voting being directly across party lines for cabinet hearings, we can probably assume it wouldn't have been any different for Garland.  Yes, what they did was unethical. But calling it a "stolen seat" assumes that Garland was, with 100% certainty, going to be voted in. That wasn't certain, so it's not fair to call it stolen. The only thing that was stolen from him was the OPPORTUNITY to be considered by Congress.  Also, this country has ALWAYS use the electoral college in presidential elections. So I'm not exactly sure what your point is there. That is reality in America. The only reason you're bringing it up is because it's a hot topic right now.

See, Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 216 (1975) (concluding, in a First Amendment case, that a narrow construction of an overbroad statute was likely inappropriate because the “deterrent effect on legitimate expression is both real and substantial.”). **As discussed below, the coercive effects of the Order’s broad language counsel against adopting a narrow construction that deprives it of any legal meaning.** &gt; The Government’s construction is not reasonable. **It requires a complete rewriting of the Order’s language and does not “save” any part of Section 9(a)’s legal effect. There is no doubt that Section 9(a), as written, changes the law.**  Either the White house council is ignorant of the constitution and giving poor advice, or this is another unconstitutional attempt to legislate by rewriting laws from the executive branch of this administration.

As soon as Scalia died McConnell wanted **the people** to decide, just for extra measure the actual quote:  *"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,”* -Mitch Mcconell.   The vote for Gorsuch was along party lines **BECAUSE** of Garlands downright injustice, many (D) Senators didn't even want to consider Gorsuch because of that middle finger to Obama's nominee. ***Which again was done for NO GOOD REASON.***  &gt;Yes, what they did was unethical. But calling it a "stolen seat" assumes that Garland was, with 100% certainty, going to be voted in. That wasn't certain, so it's not fair to call it stolen. The only thing that was stolen from him was the OPPORTUNITY to be considered by Congress.  It was certain that Garland could get the votes otherwise they would have given him a chance to be voted down. **The only reason we have doubt is because of it being manufactured.** Again. Without even waiting for Barrack to name his nominee, McConnell as soon as he heard of Scalia passing said there would be no consideration. Because he thought the people should get a chance to decide...   &gt;Also, this country has ALWAYS use the electoral college in presidential elections. So I'm not exactly sure what your point is there. That is reality in America. The only reason you're bringing it up is because it's a hot topic right now. If Hillary had won with the electoral college, I bet no one would've given a crap.   My point is not to show anything beyond hypocrisy. If we are to go by what McConnell has said, *"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice."* Well than, the American people decided they wanted whomever Hillary was going to choose since she won 3million more votes.   *Historical context:*  (The electoral college came about from the disagreements between federalists-those founders that supported a stronger central government and anti-federalists-- those that thought a central government was prone to failure. The electoral college balanced their beliefs. It gave power to states vs giving power to the people in order to secure a strong central government. *Compromise.*)	W0LF_JK	t1_dgrrm5j

It's so they can stand up at campaign time and say "we *tried* but the establishment fought us. You saw it! We need to continue the fight!".

t3_67n45g	t1_dgs5xgm	1493225930	Judicial Review is not in the Constitution, to be fair.  Judicial Review was established in Marbury vs. Madison (1803).  The Judiciary Act of 1789 gave the Supreme Court the ability to issue writs of mandamus, basically compelling or requiring government officials to act in accordance with a specific law.  Marbury brought a case to the Supreme Court with the intention of forcing Madison to turn in a letter that John Adams had wanted sent to officially appoint Marbury to a government position, but as Madison was a political opponent to Adams, he did not want that appointment done, and so did not deliver that correspondence.  Under the Judiciary Act, the Supreme Court said that Madison's actions were in fact illegal and correctable, but did not issue a writ of mandamus because they found the Judiciary Act unconstitutional as it attempted to extend the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court past what the Constitution said.  Point is, nowhere in the Constitution does it say that the courts have the power of judicial review; it is a precedent set using a specific interpretation of the Constitution that became accepted.

The wingnut war boys would have absolutely no room to say a word, because their DaddyTrump's pet billionaire Peter Thiel was 100% the reason that gawker went down in flames.  For all their moaning about free speech, they were all thrilled to watch that ship get torpedoed by Thiel's anti-free speech crusade. And as much as they love to freak out about Soros supposedly paying leftists to do stuff, we know for a fact that Thiel, the Mercers, and the Kochs have essentially bought themselves private armies (probably through Betsy DeVos's little bro Erick Prince).  So Fox getting Hindenburged by its own gas (with a little help from a liberal billionaire or two, perhaps) would be such a beautiful thing to see.	EmergencyChocolate	t1_dgsiy8e

t3_67qyai	t1_dgskugg	1493242165	Even Chomsky admits it is hyperbole, then continues:  &gt;I also said that it’s an extremely outrageous statement. But the question is whether it’s true. I mean, has there ever been an organization in human history that is dedicated, with such commitment, to the destruction of organized human life on Earth? Not that I’m aware of. Is the Republican organization—I hesitate to call it a party—committed to that? Overwhelmingly. There isn’t even any question about it.  &gt;Take a look at the last primary campaign—plenty of publicity, very little comment on the most significant fact. Every single candidate either denied that what is happening is happening—namely, serious move towards environmental catastrophe—or there were a couple of moderates, so-called—Jeb Bush, who said, "Maybe it’s happening. We really don’t know. But it doesn’t matter, because fracking is working fine, so we can get more fossil fuels." Then there was the guy who was called the adult in the room, John Kasich, the one person who said, "Yes, it’s true. Global warming’s going on. But it doesn’t matter." He’s the governor of Ohio. "In Ohio, we’re going to go on using coal for energy, and we’re not going to apologize for it." **So that’s 100 percent commitment to racing towards disaster.**	MrSpooty	t1_dgsjb0t

We thought Fox News was our old racist grandpa who it's not worth arguing with. Nov 8th made it clear that's not the case.

I realize the VAST majority of Muslims are peaceful and good people, but then I look into what inspires the ones who such such things, see that they are inspired by Islam, and I wonder, are the majority of good Muslims just shunning their religion when they disagree with parts of it?  Catholics do it too such as bigotry and premarital sex, but I don't see too many terror attacks in the name of religion there...yes there are people who bomb abortion clinics or kill gays in the name of God but is there really a comparison there in terms of volume/numbers?

Instead of cutting the top marginal income tax brackets disproportionately you could instead cut the lower marginal brackets more (which would lower everyone's taxes, not just the rich). You could also cut the payroll tax which the poor and middle class disproportionately pay due to a tax ceiling of $120,000.  Also another thing that isn't factored are state taxes, which often have regressive tax systems.	thepillowcover	t1_dgssxov

Another factor in Canada's favour is one of the original signatories of NAFTA former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney who was close with President Regan &amp; does know President Trump personally. He has been asked and accepted to consult on behalf of Canada by PM Trudeau. So if Trump thinks we pulled the wool over America's eyes the last time he will have a hard time proving this time around.

t3_67s569	t1_dgsu5sp	1493253784	&gt;So the top 1% of wage earners that pay 40% of all taxes  That is false. They pay 40% of income taxes.  Income taxes to federal government constitute 40% of the total amount of taxes the federal government receives. Another federal tax, the payroll tax is also responsible for 40% of the total amount of taxes the federal government receives.  The poor and middle class pay most of the payroll tax since it's a regressive tax due to a tax ceiling on it. Also people who earn money through capital gains don't pay payroll tax either.  What is also not being factored in is all the tax subsidies the rich take advantage of from the tax code. By the way I'm not talking about tax deductions which merely reduce the amount of taxable income, I am talking about tax credits which are checks the government gives you I.E. government handouts/subsidies. The rich take advantage of this and get a lot tax credits because they can hire sophisticated tax accountants.  So in conclusion the claim that the top 1% of wage earners pay 40% of all taxes is total bullshit.	thepillowcover	t1_dgstf3y

People who don't buy guns won't be affected and won't shop at any gun stores. If their sales go up, it was a good business decision. If profits go down, they'll probably go back on it and try to apologize, but it'll probably be too late.   It sucks but private businesses cans refuse to sell anything to anyone for any reason. Thus is doubly true of guns. Vote with your wallets. If you cant do that because you do t buy guns, I'm certain that your opinion won't sway them, and you're better off not wasting your breath.

The only time that a woman has a late term abortion is because her pregnancy is in crisis -- either her life is in danger, or the pregnancy is non-viable.    **You're punishing women for having a health crisis.**  It's the **dumbest fucking policy** that people still believe is moral.	anon902503	t1_dgt3cls

t3_67t61l	t1_dgt5mvu	1493269275	Here's my cut and paste regarding a couple of the women-killing bills passed or at attempted to pass by republicans:  There have been hundreds of these bills at state and federal level but I always use these two examples. The first one I chose because it was PASSED by hundreds of members of the republican-controlled house.  It's from the deliberately deceptive HR358. the bill's author hid the real HR358 under a bunch of reasonable sounding language about funding. The problem is, anything to do with funding is plagiarized from the Hyde Amendment and has been the law since 1976. Here's the real HR358:  &gt;(g)Nondiscrimination on Abortion (1)Nondiscrimination A Federal agency or program, and any State or local government that receives Federal financial assistance under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act), may not subject any institutional or individual health care entity to discrimination, or require any health plan created or regulated under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act) to subject any institutional or individual health care entity to discrimination, on the basis that the health care entity refuses to— (A)undergo training in the performance of induced abortions; (B)require or provide such training; (C)perform, participate in, provide coverage of, or pay for induced abortions; or (D)provide referrals for such training or such abortions. (2)Definition In this subsection, the term health care entity includes an individual physician or other health care professional, a hospital, a provider-sponsored organization, a health maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, or any other kind of health care facility, organization, or plan. (3)Remedies (A)In general The courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to prevent and redress actual or threatened violations of this section by issuing any form of legal or equitable relief, including— (i)injunctions prohibiting conduct that violates this subsection; and (ii)orders preventing the disbursement of all or a portion of Federal financial assistance to a State or local government, or to a specific offending agency or program of a State or local government, until such time as the conduct prohibited by this subsection has ceased. (B)Commencement of action An action under this subsection may be instituted by— (i)any health care entity that has standing to complain of an actual or threatened violation of this subsection; or (ii)the Attorney General of the United States. (4)Administration The Secretary shall designate the Director of the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services— (A)to receive complaints alleging a violation of this subsection; and (B)to pursue investigation of such complaints in coordination with the Attorney General.  This says that doctors and hospitals (including ERs) will face no penalties for abandoning women to die. They have no responsibility to help her at all, ease her pain or get her to a treatment center that will help her. That's actually a less extreme bill because many make it flat-out illegal to save women.  Here's a video of Georgia Rep Terry England arguing in favor of a bill making it illegal to remove dead fetuses even if mommy rots to death.  In less than 3.5 minutes, Rep. England compares women to cows and pigs, tells a fun story about cockfighting and quotes the Old Testament.  http://youtu.be/eeEfVLPWPvw	CarmineFields	t1_dgt57nz

However, the idea that she should be replaced is utter madness given that she's one of the precious few Progressive voices who understand how to fix what neoliberal hacks have broken in the nation.  This is not a problem that "words of hope" can fix.  If that opinion was remotely true, President Obama wouldn't have proven to be such an economic reform disappointment to most Americans.  It's going to take tough, "in-your-face" reform measures aimed at the nation's oligarchs and their minions to fix what a succession of Republican and Third Way Democratic sellouts broke in this nation.  With all due respect to Joe Kennedy, he's not up to the task at hand.  Among a smattering of other Progressive Democrats, Elizabeth Warren is up to that task and so was Teddy Kennedy.

I personally think the Dems would be doing themselves a great service by simply dropping guns as a part of their platform. I also think that they're frequently in the wrong on this issue. But to say that they're somehow ignoring the Constitution is false. The case history of the 2A leaves the exact degree of regulation permissible vague, and they're trying to find the sweet spot.

The question of abortion often centers around "when does the fetus (etc) have rights?" It's a completely rational approach to say "I think a 1st/2nd trimester fetus is not developed enough to be considered a person, but a 3rd trimester fetus is practically an infant, which I consider a person."

t3_67t61l	t1_dgt7leg	1493273097	&gt;Here's a video of Georgia Rep Terry England arguing in favor of a bill making it illegal to remove dead fetuses even if mommy rots to death.   Well he is an idiot. Removing a dead fetus is NOT an abortion. Abortion is a procedure which kills a living fetus. A baby that dies in the womb is called a fetal demise. That dead fetus MUST be removed or the mother will get very sick. This is standard medical practice.	rush42	t1_dgt5mvu

They also tried making maternity care non-mandatory and prohibitively expensive and kicking 26 million people off health insurance (WH number).    Can you *really* not see how hypocritical and false this all is?  It's not about saving fetuses they'll kill for their tax savings a couple months later.

People just need to take the extra 10 seconds to articulate what it is they're actually saying instead of relying on a shortcut.  Like you can call a movie bad, and nobody is going to listen.

He had also supported a ban on partial-birth abortions, promoting abstinence, and requiring—of course—“informed consent” for those seeking abortions as well as parental consent for minors. During his time as Virginia's Governor, Kaine was instrumental in the passage of the state's “informed consent” law, stating at the time that the measure would give “women information about a whole series of things, the health consequences, etc. and information about adoption.”  https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/04/clinton-feminists-ignore-hillarys-endorsements-of.html	InternetToday_	t3_67tzx6

t3_67qrau	t1_dgtect3	1493291626	Not by much though really? I've seen I think James Murdoch give a commencement speech to graduating journalism students (or something) and it was still pretty weird stuff.  Specifically his argument in the speech was something like "the only thing that can keep journalism free and safe is profit" where the whole implication was that the BBC or other public broadcasters couldn't possibly broadcast news in the public interests.  It was a few years ago and I'm only remembering the broad themes, but it was like darts-Vader-junior stuff to my opinion.  Have you got any references which shows how the younger Murdochs opinions differ?	lyth	t1_dgtcliq

t3_67tzx6	t1_dgtehim	1493291923	Centrists are fully free to primary any and all pro-life Democrats.  In fact, I'd encourage it.   1.  Mello is campaigning as a pro-choice Democrat.   2.  Mello has a history of fighting for and leadership on other issues of women's rights, freedoms, and women's health.  It's really only abortion where his history becomes more complicated.   3.  Progressives have been told often and loudly that a lot of the issues they hold most dear are less important and they're screwing up not only the party, but the progress on issues we agree on by making a big deal out of them.  How is this different?    I agree with you that the right to choose is an issue that the Democratic Party should have zero movement on, one that they should not budge a degree on.  Yet, I have several issues that "no compromise" category, some of which I value higher than abortion rights, and the Democratic Party does not/has not supported several issues that were more important to me.  That's not to say I'd trade abortion rights for those issues, but I do fight for those issues harder.  Why must we progressives compromise on those issues to fully support Hillary Clinton, who is clearly better than a Republican, but doesn't believe in the issues most important to us, when the other side is unwilling to compromise on a mayoral candidate in a plain state, who is clearly better than a Republican, but doesn't have a fully good history on an issue more important to you?  Why does compromise and cooperation between the wings of the party seem like it has to be a one way street?  I have to pick and choose my dealbreakers in order to exist within the Democratic party.

Trumps tax proposal is thin, but it includes abolishing   1) the alternative minimum tax, which made *his personal taxes* jump from 3% effective to ~20% in 2005  2) state and local tax deductions against federal taxes, which specifically punishes metropolitan areas - read - where he has the least support.  Oh, and yeah, it'll raise our debt to GDP ratio to 111% by 2027 and will give 2/3 of its breaks to corporations.

t3_67qrau	t1_dgtin8z	1493299210	I'll see if I can dig it up, but there was something recently will the bill o'reilly thing about how the younger Murdochs have been having more influence over their father and the company and would likely take it more center right. The idea is that when they started, there wasn't really a voice for conservative news but now there's a ton of it. The bombast was great for awhile, but they don't want to be lumped in with the noise on the right long term. Going center right still keeps their core ideology, but moves away from the era of Glenn Beck, O'Reilly, Hannity, etc.  It sort of legitimizes them as a counterpoint to mainstream media which tends to lean left. They have the eyeballs and viewers, of course, but they're still seen as firebrands largely dominated by pundits, more than actual hard news and the younger Murdochs know that.	akaghi	t1_dgtect3
t3_67ukex	t1_dgtir39	1493299361	Exactly. When bills first started being able to be voted out of committee, a lot of politicians started getting nervous and having to actually answer for their vote rather than pretending to hold different opinions on the issue or acting like they don't take sides but clearly falling one way when it's actually time to vote. And the nice thing about pushing it out of committee was that you couldn't always just skip the vote because you might not know for sure when you'll have to vote on it.   To put it plainly, forcing a recorded vote on an issue is a very good thing because usually you can be murky on your stance and people can "feel" like you'll vote one way. But push comes to shove, you can either vote yes or no. And as much as I completely agree that political beliefs are not binary you still only have one of two options and your vote has the same effect as everyone else who votes with you regardless of how much you claim to hate "le establishment". IMO the only time we should not hold someone to their vote is if there is something defective with the legislation itself that separates the vote from the underlying policy position, or the legislator is out there writing their own bills to show exactly where they stand on an issue.	trump_4_gulag	t1_dgthqqi

t3_67t61l	t1_dgtj4su	1493299881	I don't even understand why you would say that. Nobody is killing women.   This all started bc a pro life democrat supported a bill that would ban abortions after20 weeks. Not before that point. This law is clearly to protect a viable late term fetus. All of these laws have exceptions for the health of the mother, but as I have said before, mom gets better when the baby is out. Whether the baby is dead or alive will have no bearing on what happens to the mother. So why not deliver the baby alive?  The other bill he supported was for fetal ultrasound which is a good idea! All it does is attempt to educate a woman and maybe save the life of her preborn child. How is this killing women???  Anti abortion laws are put in place to help women AND children. Remember when everyone flipped about wanting to bring abortion clinics up to medical standards? This got shot down by pro abortion groups (no doubt at the behest of the abortion industry). So they actually want women to have abortions in substandard clinics? Tell me who is killing more women!!  Late term abortion leads to horrible stories like Kermit Gosnell. Go look that up. He did late term abortions in abhorrent conditions with unqualified personnel. A lot of late term preborn infants died, *but so did women!*  Again, most pro lifers want a ban on late term abortion and are okay with keeping early abortion safe and legal. So your assertion that we want to kill women is a conspiracy theory invented to scare ppl into voting against things that actually *help* women.	rush42	t1_dgthadx

It will show his assets - we can start to dig where those assets came into existence. It will show debt obligations - we can start to dig to find out who has a piece of leverage on our President.   2. Tax Evasion/Fraud proof. Let's say a media organization or the intelligence agencies have proof that Trump is an owner of a particular property or shell corporation or what have you. What if it's not on his returns? Even if the intelligence agencies cannot prove collusion, the tax returns give them (and media organizations) the ability to investigate tax fraud.	well_okay_then	t1_dgtfu5y

t3_67t61l	t1_dgtk2i9	1493301095	From the blog of one of the women in the Guardian article that you claimed help "evolve" your views: "My ignorance about third-term abortions came from a lifetime of being steeped in a culture that casually perpetuates ignorance and misinformation about abortion. When I stepped on that flight to Colorado, I wasn’t sure that I’d ever come home—least of all that I’d keep my uterus. I thought I was doing something incredibly risky. Thanks to Dr. Hern’s skill and 40 years of developing the safest methods ever practiced, my procedure, risky and tricky as it was, remains safer than live birth.  But, in the wrong hands, this procedure is incredibly risky. Just months after my return from Colorado and Dr. Hern’s excellent clinic, another doctor, Kermit Gosnell, was convicted of myriad atrocities related to providing illegal later abortions in his clinic in Philadelphia, PA. He was found guilty of infanticide, as well as spreading disease between his patients because he did not bother to autoclave his instruments and reused disposable instruments. It made me sick to read about this. The worst part of all: if he had been my one last hope, even knowing what I know now, I would have gone to him for help. Most people think this is pre Roe v. Wade stuff, but it is contemporary. Desperation leads to extreme and terrible outcomes when all the safe doors are slammed shut.  Which brings me to my backup plan. I certainly hope that if I had not found an abortion provider, I would have further discussed infant hospice with my team and come to some other choice I could live with. But when we didn’t know if abortion was an option, my husband and I spoke briefly about going off the grid, somewhere nobody could override a DNR. I have to emphasize how incredibly risky that would have been. My baby was likely to developed hydrocephaly. Her head might have swelled to unsafe proportions before the birth. Her poor muscle tone made her a challenging case for vaginal delivery anyway. I could have died trying to birth her outside of a hospital. But I thought about it. It feels stupid now, but I know I wasn’t stupid, I was desperate." http://endingawantedpregnancy.com/dandy-walker-third-trimester-abortion/	ParlorSocialist	t1_dgtj4su

I mean the man has been in violation of a dozen laws since being sworn in and his offspring are just as bad - yet we can't even suggest investigating without devin nunes sprinting to Trumps feet to ask for directions.   The constitution only works/applies *if congress wants it to* so there's no recourse. Think about it, who will prosecute the president? The DoJ. Who appointed the AG (head of DoJ)? The president.   Well who nominates and confirms a Supreme Court justice, who would hear the case against the president? The president and congress - which in this case is dominated by the president's party and coconspirators.   The states control districting and voter suppression, so they can keep opposition out of power and send cronies to DC.

There aren't too many contested seats up and Democratic voter turnout for midterms is usually pretty embarrassing. I would very much like to be wrong on this.

Just like 2018 is GOING to be a wave of blue. However, I'm hopeful that people learned their lesson and will actually show up for mid-terms. Especially if Trump is still in office at that point - I have a feeling more and more stuff is going to come out about the collusion and his conflicts of interest and the GOP won't do anything. If that continues to happen the next 2 years, then I'm pretty hopeful 2018 will go very blue.	well_okay_then	t1_dgtl3yq

Secondly you and I already discussed these special cases, and I had come up with the idea to get an emergency court order just like hospitals do when a parent objects to a lifesaving treatment for a child.   The truth is that most of dr gosnells patients were not there for medical reasons.   http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/10/study-ids-reasons-for-late-term-abortions/  http://blog.secularprolife.org/2016/07/no-most-late-term-abortions-are-not_13.html?m=1  They went for late term abortion bc for some reason they delayed the decision. That's where education comes in. When ppl understand how a baby develops and when he or she can be considered fully viable, they would make an earlier decision. I do agree with access to early abortions bc that is one way to prevent the late ones.	rush42	t1_dgtk2i9

t3_67rkbl	t1_dgtqdwo	1493308233	I agree with everything you say, but when you said they were racist you weren't speaking in the voice of an Islamophobe, you were speaking of them.  You used the wrong word.  I wasn't giving them too much credit because it wasn't about them.  Are a lot of racists also people who hate Muslims?  Yes, absolutely.  Vice-versa?  Yep.  Does that change the fact that you're talking about the wrong people.  Not all racists hate Muslims, not all Islamophobes hate people of other races.  I'm a mixed race Southerner who's lived nearly his entire life in rural Florida.  I can pass as white.  I have a pretty good idea of the face of racism.  I also have Black extended family members who support keeping Muslims out of this country.  First time I saw one of those facebook posts I did a double take, but it ended up being not uncommon.  They're mostly Baptists and I assume this is where their hate comes from.  I don't really relish approaching this subject with them right now, so I'm not going to verify this.  To be clear, I don't support religious discrimination at any level, nor do I think people should be kept out of this country for reasons of religion nor am I overly concerned with terrorism, because statistics.  I'm also pro-gun, and think any American (or permanent legal resident) should have the same gun rights as any other.  tl;dr all kinds of people hate all kind of other people for all kinds of reasons, and we have different words for different varieties of bigotry.	fleshrott	t1_dgtosbs

t3_67t61l	t1_dgtqyvo	1493308854	Except the fact that a fetus is part of the mother's body until it is born. That's a very big difference. How do you measure your age? I use birthdays as a convention.  Conjoined twins are not very analogous to mother/fetus, the connection is much different. I am not sure how to answer your question about rights. I hadn't even broached that subject yet. Were you expecting me to say that we should wantonly kill conjoined twins because they are connected by an external flab of skin?  I was merely stating that birth is a significant event in the development of a human being. It's not some arbitrary milestone. I am not suggesting that unborn babies should be treated as objects. It's a very serious decision to end their life. I just think while the fetus is part of the mother's body, it's ultimately her decision and her concern. A decision I hope isn't taken lightly.

We have immigrants from ex-communist countries who were all involuntarily members of their country's communist party, this includes cubans, chinese, and eastern europeans. While _involuntary_ membership does not disqualify you from citizenship, I can imagine some of the applicants lied by saying they weren't members since they didn't participate in communist activities or volunteer to be members.

t3_67wgph	t1_dgtssnj	1493310792	I bet dollars to donuts that this is related to efforts to alienate Muslims and brown people in general. They will want to remove those who aren't 'Real Americans'!  What would happen to these denaturalized citizens? Would they get a green card or would they be thrown out of the country which they became citizens of?  What would happen to those newly naturalized citizens or immigrants on green cards? They would be in terror of negotiating new salaries, switching jobs or even leaving relationships in fear that a minor lie exposed by their boss, their SOs etc. would send them packing from the country.  It would essentially create a set of second-class citizens who will be forced to act like serfs. Funny because this is exactly how oil rich middle east dictatorships work in regards to Asian immigrants.  edit: having read the transcripts, I can say that Justice Roberts identified another issue. If the law is interpreted the way that Trump's administration wants, it would get essentially unlimited power to denaturalize anyone they didn't like because almost everyone had lied about something small/ immaterial on forms submitted.	thedabking123	t3_67wgph

This is objective fact.  I have already provided the pertinent section of the bill (HR358) for you.    The only question that remains is "why did people who claim to be pro-life support such a terrible bill?".  I can only give you my theory as to why.  I believe it's because of deep-rooted misogyny and a desire to punish girls and women for having sex, including rape.    Now, maybe that's unfair.

There are unanswered questions about when she first immigrated to the United States and whether she worked illegally here before she obtained her green card.  If she lied about this or any other matters on her green card/citizenship application, using the Trump Administration interpretation as argued before the Supreme Court, she could be deported.  Gee, Trump might be able to use that when he tires of her and decides to move on to a younger model.	konorM	t3_67wgph
t3_67t61l	t1_dgu2k1l	1493321219	Okay I read what you had sent earlier.   I don't see anywhere in that bill where it talks about letting women die, or not providing emergency care.   What it DOES say is that no one can force a hospital or doctor to act against their religious beliefs. This happened with me on both sides, as a doctor and as a patient. As a doctor I could refuse to be the anesthesiologist in an abortion case and they would just have to assign someone else.   As a patient it was even more interesting! All my kids....living and dead....were born at aCatholic hospital. When one of my twins died inside me, of course they were allowed to take the dead baby out bc that is NOT AN ABORTION. I was very sick and so my other son was delivered prematurely. Again no problem. A few years later I had a miscarriage at 14 weeks. The baby died but my body did not expel him as it should. So the doctors had to do a d and c to get the dead tissue out. Again, NOT AN ABORTION.   If I had gone to the Catholic hospital saying "hey I don't want this baby; please abort it", they would be within their legal rights to refuse on moral/religious grounds. That's all this law means.   It's about religious freedom, not about killing women! No woman is dying here.	rush42	t1_dgu15ai

t3_67xybm	t1_dgu3unh	1493322591	Yeah except for the fact that he can't. The antiquities act allows a president to designate a national monument out of otherwise unreserved federal land. It does not allow a president to un-designate one.  Signing an executive order directing his interior secretary to study monument designations since 1996 does not override a specific piece of legislation, nor does it override the constitutional mechanism for passing legislation.   It does not matter if he "signals his willingness" to revoke monument designition unilaterally any more than it matters if he "signals his willingness" to pass a tax cut unilaterally or build a border wall unilaterally.  Framing the issue this way concedes the threshold issue without a fight, and that is stupid.   This executive order is terrible, this administration's environmental priorities are terrible, this administration's plans for public lands are terrible (and that is changed by the president forcing a park superintendent to show up to have pocket change thrown at him or Ryan Zinke riding a horse to the office). And it should all be criticized as such.

Many people were angry and questioned why I would not endorse Donald Trump or attend the Republican Convention. I’ve long had concerns with Donald Trump that go beyond his temperament. We have substantive policy differences on conservative issues like trade, our relationship with Russia, and the importance of balancing the federal budget. I’ve held out hope that he would change on those disqualifying policy positions, but he has not. I’ve also encouraged him to change his behavior for the better and offer a positive, inclusive vision for our country, but he has not. It’s clear that he hasn’t changed and has no interest in doing so. As a result, Donald Trump is a man I cannot and should not support. The actions of the last day are disgusting, but that’s not why I reached this decision, it has been an accumulation of his words and actions that many have been warning about. I will not vote for a nominee who has behaved in a manner that reflects so poorly on our country.

t3_67zh8h	t1_dguhzdv	1493339193	The point it is unlikey that you can pay off NK. They feel far more threatened by the US than Iran does by Israel, especially after looking at what happened in Iraq and Libya. Unlike Iran, they can't really defend themselves well conventionally. One might think that the damage they could inflict in a conventional war is enough deterrence for the US, and it probably is, but to NK ICBMs are a far better long-term security guarantee. With the US, it is also harder to predict for NK what policy the following administrations would follow.   One should of course try a diplomatic solution, but if that doesn't involve the withdrawal of US forces from East Asia, which would be unacceptable to the US, I'm doubtful it would work.   I'm not advocating for military action here. I think the US should try all possible non-military options. If that doesn't work, it would be better to just accept NK's nuclear deterrence than to potentially kick off a catastrophic war in the region.	senfgurke	t1_dgugwfl

t3_67ziw1	t1_dguiity	1493339796	&gt; Kasich told CNN's Jake Tapper that he didn't receive a call himself. But he said one of his aides confirmed to him a New York Times report last month saying Donald Trump Jr. tried to entice Kasich with a position as the most powerful vice president in history -- putting him in charge of all domestic and foreign policy -- was accurate.  That's so pathetic, but it's also a lie, because obviously Mike Pense, also a Governor, is doing none of these things.  I want to say Kasich chose wisely, but had he been able to stick this out, he'd likely be POTUS for some period of time, and be an attractive candidate for re-election in 2020.

t3_67t61l	t1_dgulyq9	1493343434	&gt; I still don't think the bills say what you think they do.  Again, I didn't get my opinion from the NWLC, I found it to back up what I'm saying.  The NWLC and I independently came to the same conclusion about HR358.  It was barely covered by the media because it was all lumped in with the "war on women" that everyone laughed off.    &gt;someone in the government would ask a doctor, or a medical expert would get involved who would straighten it out.  Why would they do that?  This isn't meant to protect or help women.  This is done because catholic and right-wing religious groups lobbied for it.  Even if the doctors are fantastic people and want to help, hospital management doesn't have to provide the training or equipment to save women's lives, according to HR358.  This isn't a medical "oopsy".  This is dozens and dozens of bills in every state in the union and federally.    &gt;Nobody would pass a law that makes no medical sense.  Hundreds of members of the republican house DID pass it!!!  &gt;What they are trying to do is make the law so that pro life doctors and Catholic hospitals do not have to violate their conscience.  Let's think about that.  They are saying that the doctors (who chose ER as a specialty instead of the hundreds of other specialities that wouldn't force them to perform abortions) *deserve* the right to decide who lives and who dies for their own comfort level, but women and girls (including rape victims) don't deserve that same power over our own bodies.  Why is killing an embryo wrong but going for a coffee break while a viable woman dies from an ectopic pregnancy is morally justifiable?  Beyond that, giving doctors' and hospitals' religious beliefs more value than women's lives, they are violating the 1st Amendment.  By giving men the protection of medical law and triage while withholding it from women is a 14th Amendmeny violation.	CarmineFields	t1_dguj9zm

I'm starting to think Heinlein was right. Maybe this is the end of the social democratic system. Maybe these are the days when the democratic ideologies fail and the realization that individuals who do not vest their lives in the well being of others, in the body politic, in the interest of their fellow citizens simply have not earned the right to be franchised with the vote.  I am at this point (2017), not the same as earlier years, where I am an advocate for a return to limited franchise. Although how to determine that is up for debate. Obviously it can't be military only because the world has changed since the 1950's when Heinlein advocated limited franchise when so many men had served in the military and were ready to support their fellow citizen, soldier, human being. Literally jump on a grenade to save another human life regardless of perception of value because that's what good men/women do for each other.  In today's world, the military is ingratiated with the same class discrepancy you see walking down the street. The officers are educated, the enlisted couldn't get a job at McDonalds. A new franchise movement is needed, but how to determine the legitimate voters and electors to me at this point is unknowable and up for debate as far as I'm concerned. But limited franchise seems to be the only answer. All are welcome to apply and test of course.	an_internet_denizen	t1_dgt6whx

So in their minds, god created a "good" person who has just been corrupted, but it's okay because you can totally  "pray the gay away" and go back to being a good, heterosexual person again.	maultet	t1_dguulls
t3_680zda	t1_dguvbqx	1493355099	Because the media player is terrible, here's a rough transcription.  "We had a good conversation last night. He expressed that yes, he was very much thinking about cancelling. I highlighted, quite frankly,  whether there was a better deal to come, there were an awful lot of jobs, an awful lot of industries right now, that have been developed under the NAFTA context. A disruption like cancelling NAFTA, even if it theoretically, eventually might lead to better outcomes, would cause a lot of short and medium term pain for an awful lot of families. He, like me, got elected on a platform of helping people, helping the middle class, growing the economy in ways that bring along people that don't always feel that they've had a fair shake. That's not something that either one of us would want.  So we agreed that we could sit down and get to work on looking at ways to improve NAFTA as it's been improved before, in a thoughtful way that will be to the benefit of all our countries. That's exactly what he agreed with." Justin Trudeau	haikarate12	t3_680zda

Kasich traveled all over Ohio going on local TV and explaining why he would never support Trump and how he thinks Trump has no ideas (I bet he feels damn vindicated now, lol) pretty much up to election day.  He fing tweeted ~~"Stronger Together" at one point~~.   Sorry, I mis-remembered that.  Kasich tweeted we have to help "every child" reach their "God-given potential".  A Clinton buzzword, but not literally her campaign slogan.   While his integrity on things like Trump or the Ohio GOP's attempt to enact a poll tax on college students impresses me, the rumor is basically that trying to work with him on *anything* is very frustrating because of this aspect of his personality.	zryn3	t1_dguwrs4
t3_67ziw1	t1_dgux7xk	1493368583	Oh, I admire his anti-Trump stance. It's genuine and he stood by it whereas Romney, Christie, Perry, Rubio, and Cruz all capitulated.

t3_67t61l	t1_dgvbzoh	1493393989	I've been researching this hr 358 and most of the sources I found were from 2011, and were also from left-leaning, pro choice websites. Finally I found something written in 2017 that talks about it without the leftward slant.   http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/religious-liberty/conscience-protection/upload/The-Need-for-The-Abortion-Non-Discrimination-Act.pdf  This brings up a couple of important points. First of all there were NO CASES of anyone dying as a result of this law. Indeed i am not aware of any medical cases that would require an emergency abortion to save a life bc as I said they could just deliver the baby alive. The only thing I could think of was maybe if someone was bleeding, threatening miscarriage but the fetus still Has a heartbeat. In a case like this, they would stabilize the patient and transfer her somewhere that would do abortions. (In the meantime she would probably either have the miscarriage or they would be able to stop it.) the other thing I thought of was pre eclampsia but most of those cases do not happen before the fetus is viable and can be delivered. Usually this condition is managed medically by controlling the patients blood pressure etc. If that doesn't work, they do deliver the baby, but remember the earliest surviving preemie was 21 weeks and 5 days....I've seen small babies born and not make it, but I've never seen anyone need an abortion for pre eclampsia.   I did find a couple of blog posts etc, written by women who really misunderstood the situation they were in and the procedure they had done. There is a lot of misinformation out there. For example, your statement that doctors would take a coffee break while a woman dies of a ruptured ectopic would NEVER happen! Removing an ectopic...*before* it ruptures...is not an abortion; it is a lifesaving procedure.   The point of HR 358 was not to kill women...like I said, there was not even one case of a woman who died as a result of this law. It was to protect doctors and nurses who didn't want to be fired bc they refused to violate their own principles AND the Hippocratic oath which states a doctor should not perform abortions. The ideal is to save BOTH lives, the mother's and the baby's. No one would be taking a coffee break while the mother died. They would be actively trying to stabilize her. Actually if the mother dies, the baby will also die, soooo.....  Edit for grammar	rush42	t1_dgulyq9

t3_682h5q	t1_dgveiw9	1493396722	Is there any statistics where the difference between immigrants and native born are split into different groups of crime?  All I've seen is the total amount of crime. There are different types of crime with different impact on society so it would be interesting to see it in more detail.  An example would be DUI where it's probably a more likely chance for a native born to drive a vehicle than an immigrant and that might explain why they have a higher rate of DUI.  And those numbers in the article in your comment is for ALL immigrants. The article you posted was about the southern border so the statistics you linked to is not a good enough argument in this case.	LookMumImOnReddit	t1_dgvduwl

t3_67t61l	t1_dgvjreo	1493402452	I've tried to make what happened with hr358 clear but you seem to misunderstand.  I'll try again.  &gt;First of all there were NO CASES of anyone dying as a result of this law.  Yes.  Because it was never a law.  HR358 was passed by the House but never made it to the senate because it was dropped when Obama promised to veto it.   Even if the senate had passed it, it was so grossly unconstitutional that I can pretty much guarantee there would have been an emergency judicial hold put on it and it would have been thrown out.  The point I'm making by educating people about hundreds of failed republican bills isn't that women can't currently get medical care.  It's that the people sobbing loudest about life are doing everything in their power to endanger women's lives.    &gt;It was to protect doctors and nurses who didn't want to be fired bc they refused to violate their own principles  No one is forced to be an ER doctor.  Tell me, doctor, in your career as a anesthesiologist were you ever forced to perform an abortion?  So you can choose hundreds of specialties that won't compromise your ethics.    What is grossly selfish and appalling is the right-wing's demand that doctors get to choose emergency service jobs that they refuse to perform and that women just shut up and die for doctor's "morals".    &gt;Hippocratic oath which states a doctor should not perform abortions.  This is a gross mischaracterization and worse yet, it's excusing the (what would have been) the deaths of women for no purpose.  Would it have been Hippocrates will that you rather than harming a guaranteed-to-die embryo?    &gt;Actually if the mother dies, the baby will also die, soooo.....  YES!!!  THIS IS ONE OF MY MAIN POINTS!!!!  This demonstrates how useless this bill is.  It wouldn't save a single embryo or fetus.

I thought it did a pretty good job of explaining the issues from the perspective of those who supported the bill/law. Look at it again.    &gt;No one is forced to be an ER doctor.  Tell me, doctor, in your career as a anesthesiologist were you ever forced to perform an abortion?  So you can choose hundreds of specialties that won't compromise your ethics.    I was put in situations where I would have to give anesthesia to women who were getting an abortion, meaning that I would be involved in the case, and I objected bc I did not wish to participate in any way. Same with nurses, scrub techs, ultrasound specialists etc. They are not the ones actually doing the abortions but they do not want to be involved in facilitating one.   I'm not sure what the story is with the ER guys but I would assume it's something like giving an abortifacient (medication that causes abortion)...,obviously it wouldn't be a surgical procedure. It might even apply to the emergency contraception they would give to a rape victim, in which case that law really sucks, but it's not going to kill women. It would just make it so they would have to get an abortion anyway, which is counterproductive.   Unless you are saying that these doctors should NOT have chosen to be ER doctors if they were not willing to do such treatments. And in that case I would say that being an ER doc involves a lot more that just treating patients who would need an "emergency abortion " for whatever reason. They would be a very small percentage of what an ER doc treats. Most OB/gyn situations would require the ER physicians to call in the OB/gyn specialist anyway.    &gt;;This demonstrates how useless this bill is.  It wouldn't save a single embryo or fetus.  The only thing this incredibly mean, stupid, pointless bill would have done if it became law would be to KILL OR MAIM INNOCENT WOMEN AND GIRLS!!!  The point is not that it would save the preborn infant, bc if the woman really wanted an abortion she would find a hospital or provider who would do it. The point of the bill/law is not to force practitioners and hospitals to do things to which they morally object.   Nobody wants to be mean, and nobody wants to kill women! That just would not make any sense at all. The purpose of all medical treatment is to save lives, not kill them. Ideally they can save both the mother and the baby.	rush42	t1_dgvjreo

I dont think torturing these killers make the family feel any better, it doesnt bring back their loved ones. What about the killers family. Is it okay to punish them too? Maybe if you think the family is the only influence on why their son/daughter became a killer. Its a complex issue.  It also sends a message that if the state is willing to kill, and to inflict pain, then it must be at some level acceptable, which I dont think it is.	birdiesanders2016	t1_dgvp495

It's a type of brutality that's different from gladiator fights to the death. Instead of a sword or spear (or guillotine) used to kill, we've turned the "weapons" into a pen and paper. The judge is arguing that doing so removes the visceral brutality of cutting someone's head off and gives us (as a society) a degree of separation from the act of killing that makes us feel better about the fact that we're killing someone.

IIRC, there was a botched execution a few years back in... Oklahoma I think it was, where the paralyzing agent seemed to either have not  been applied properly, or had failed.  The prisoner was gasping for air and saying "I can't breath," the witnesses became visibly disturbed with how agitated and suffering he was having, and the state actually closed the curtain on the members of the press and family who were there as witnesses.  Again, the state stopped showing the execution to the witnesses  once the person being executed showed unexpected signs of discomfort.	GaimeGuy	t1_dgvp8eo

t3_684rg2	t1_dgvwj69	1493417789	Yes, they feel that way, some do at least I am sure but feelings aren't always the best thing to decide something.  My problem with that argument is two-fold.  1. We are all going to die, you, me, everyone, the good, the bad, all die so how is that a punishment exactly? They die sooner? Well, sure but so do all kinds of people every second of every day, accidents, disease, crime, sudden death is all around us. So I don't see it as less a punishment than an eventuality.   2. Prison is the worst, no hyperbole, prison is fucking awful and really one of the things that keeps most prisoners sane is that one day it ends with their release. But not if you're in there for life, every day for the rest of yours it's 23 hours in a cell, 1 hour outside, that's it. Nothing to do, nothing to look forward to, no hope about anything just an endless grin until death were you die alone in some prison hospital. I don't know about you but I think I'd rather die than go to jail for the rest of my life.  So that's why I think that the death penalty isn't being hard on crime, the exact opposite in terms of vengeance, when you're dead that's it, no more suffering, no nothing. How is that a punishment? If someone hurt me to the point of a death penalty trial I'd want them to live in a small room and never have anything in their lives again, they're still going to die but they're going to feel the decay on the way.	thewholedamnplanet	t1_dgvpefh

We all have parts of our jobs we are uncomfortable with but doctors know the possibilities before signing up for a specialty.  Let me put this another way.  Lets say there's a small town with only a few firemen.  Do you think the same people supporting HR358 would support a Muslim firefighter's religious freedom to let a family burn to death because it's one of the five times a day he's required to turn towards Mecca and pray?  Even if you are right about motivation (and the other bills make me strongly doubt this) what republicans and right-to-lifers want is religious freedom for "Christian" groups no matter how appalling, but no freedom for women or other religious groups.    This is a huge constitutional violation.  These reps are paid by female taxpayers to defend our safety and rights.  They've 100% abdicated that responsibility for (at best) religious beliefs.

That way the good people can stop the bad. Also, we need guns to stop the government from showing up and making us all a bunch of dirty democ... communist.  Well the president himself rolled in with a huge convoy of government guards. A) obviously the NRA should believe that the president would be more safe if every member of that crowd had a gun. That way no one could attack Trump before the good people of the NRA gunned him down. B) holy shit. I can not think of any other time you would be more at risk of the government forcing you at gun point to surrender your freedoms than when your basically locked into a room with the President and 20 of his armed guards. Everyone obviously needs a lot of guns to make sure Trump doesn't order his guards to oppress the room. And this is especially true for trump, who has a known history of proudly ordering his guards to impose themselves at gun point on people attending his speeches.   basically. the NRA is a bunch of hypocrites. They should have made it clear that either Trump tells the secret service to let guns in, or Trump doesn't get to speak at their event. By agreeing to the ban of guns the NRA proved everything they stood for is more or less bull shit.	handoverhand321	t1_dgw0kg9

Who the hell ever said guns are not dangerous?  And what hypocrisy?  Have you ever actually looked at the full argument made by gun rights supporters or do you just parrot the talking points your anti gun friends give you on facebook?  The NRA argues against gun free zones because there is never security people present to compensate.  When the secret service is providing onsite security that is an entirely different form of a gun free zone, one that is actually much more safe because there is still armed security present.  And because this event is voluntary to attend nobody is being forced to disarm.  But distinctions like this weaken your argument so I can see why you willfully ignore them.  &gt;Or you're admitting that Trump should be protected, but nobody else should be.

There are secular pro life groups such as this one:  http://blog.secularprolife.org/2016/07/no-most-late-term-abortions-are-not_13.html?m=1  There are groups of doctors that are pro life but not bc of Christianity. It could be another religion too. Being pro life is not exclusive to Christians.   Also did you know that 47% of women are pro life?   Pro life is not synonymous with anti woman. Abortion hurts women too!   http://www.lifenews.com/2014/12/19/suicide-rate-for-women-having-abortions-is-six-times-higher-than-women-giving-birth/  http://www.lifenews.com/2006/01/02/nat-1941/  Even in rape cases, often the victim feels emotionally worse if she aborts the baby,  bc of guilt over taking the life of her baby for the crime of his father. This is a complicated issue.   My point is that most pro life ppl do NOT hate women and certainly don't want to kill them!	rush42	t1_dgvy9r6
t3_686dma	t1_dgw21m7	1493425507	I'm sorry but that is not enough planning going into immigration.  We have to limit the numbers to make sure we can keep up infrastructure to provide the resources needed for the incoming people and our own population growth. California is a great example of this, their population has increased too fast and they have not been able to keep up with the production of drinkable water. The aquifers are being drained and the rivers are also.  I understand wanting to help people but we have to it in a well thought out manner to provide the services to all citizens new and old.

t3_686dma	t1_dgw3it4	1493427426	White supremacy is not just their internal ideology.  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy now being forcibly injected into all of our mainstream lives.  Trump's original campaign issue was stopping terrorism from ISIS. Then it was stopping illegal immigration to block ISIS from entering the country.  Then it became deporting some illegal immigrants to prevent domestic terrorism (despite most cases of domestic terrorism being done by radicalized citizens).  Then he shifted to deporting more illegal immigrants to prevent serious crimes like rape and murder (despite most of those crimes being committed by citizens).  Then he shifted to deporting every single illegal immigrant for technically being "criminals", even if they are only guilty of a visa-overstay, which isn't really a crime but rather an administrative violation that carries zero jail time.  Legally, it's in the same class as failing to file an income tax return, which under federal law results in a fine but no jail time.  Before people realize how far we've slid from the anti-ISIS argument, all brown and black people are now subject to sudden and indefinite detention in ICE concentration camps, regardless of their actual immigration status.  With only a few judges to process them, they could stay there for years until it can be verified whether a mistake occurred.  This creates a huge artificial bias against investing in any relations with brown or black people.  Of course, it is still perfectly legal to form business or personal relationships with them, but now the government itself is unnaturally mandating strong practical reasons to avoid investing any money, time, or emotion into such relationships.  If the federal government can suddenly throw any of your minority relationships into prolonged chaos at any time, their message to you is "you're better off sticking with whites."  So now whites have a big government-mandated incentive to associate only among themselves, and racial minorities have a big government-mandated incentive to value whites (even) more and avoid other minorities as comparatively less reliable folk.  This unwritten apartheid will eventually prepare mainstream Americans to accept formal apartheid, long before the first segregation bill gets introduced into Congress.   It starts here by deliberately worsening racial divisions and infringing everyone's First Amendment right to freely associate with whomever we damn well please, free from government interference.	voompanatos	t3_686dma

t3_67t61l	t1_dgw5588	1493429648	&gt; It could just be a personal objection.   The scope of influence of either your religion or your personal morals must end at you.    It's not a service to God or even doing what's right to expect others to sacrifice for your beliefs.  You've got to sacrifice for your own beliefs.    This means that we don't withhold an abortificant or surgery or whatever, and risk a woman's life and health.  It means we go be a dermatologist or cardiac surgeon or something.    &gt;And I'm not sure why you're singling out Christians here.  For a couple of reasons.  First of all, the religious right has been forcing a fake version of Christianity down people's throats for years now.  Secondly, because you suggested in an earlier comment that the actions of anti-choicers couldn't be hate-based because the people wanting the hateful legislation were religious so that means they can't be hateful or something.    &gt;Also did you know that 47% of women are pro life?  This is a frequent point but it truly does not matter.  No one gets to take my personal liberty from me, not men but not women either.    &gt;Pro life is not synonymous with anti woman. Abortion hurts women too!  It doesn't, by definition, have to be anti-woman, but in reality it very often is.  It's far more anti-woman than pro-woman.    Again, the same right-wing that sobs about life supports making maternity care unaffordable for millions of women.  These exact same group of folks, spend far more money on feeding the industrial war complex and sometimes even on the death penalty than they do on women's and children's health.  It's sick.  This corporate Christianity they've developed.  If you are a Christian, I suggest you do some deep soul-searching on what Trump, the right-wing and the majority of Christians in America represent.  I can assure you that in NO WAY does it resemble the gospels.  These aren't Christians.  These are the modern Pharisees.  That's why they call out the whores who get pregnant but life ceases to matter the second it costs a dime of their tax money.  Jesus and Paul repeatedly tell us to pay our taxes and that money is valueless.  Jesus performed a miracle (fish/coin) to get money to pay a tax he didn't even owe.    The entire right-wing needs to turn their holier-than-thou-but-we'll-kick-you-when-you're-down attitude around.    It's unconstitutional, it's inhumane, and it sure as hell isn't Christianity.

It's one thing to read the headline "20 children killed in mass shooting," it's another thing entirely to see a dead eight year old surrounded by the bodies of his closest friends.      We tend to think of gun violence as this sterile thing that we see on TV and in the movies, this small explosion of cherry red blood if even that, the stoic hero showing no signs of pain, maybe even getting up and carrying on, but that's not real life.  In real life a bullet is as likely to deform and rip a hole in a person as it is to be a clean in-and-out like we see on TV, it's gruesome and painful and terrible.

t3_686tuy	t1_dgw6lnp	1493431695	From your article:      &gt;Tens of thousands of cars enter Washington and Chicago each day from places where guns are easily and legally obtainable. Any of those vehicles could be transporting a carton of pistols to sell to willing thugs. If you're on an island, you're going to get splashed by the waves.  &gt;The proponents obviously knew all along this city-by-city approach had serious shortcomings. But they figured it was bound to curtail gun availability somewhat. They also hoped that by prohibiting handguns in one place, they were beginning a bigger process.  &gt;First, they expected that other cities and states would follow suit. Second, they wagered that strict controls at the local level would acclimate Americans to new regulations at the national level.      So the problem was that the gun laws didn't go far enough, that people would just leave the state or county and buy guns somewhere that they're easier to obtain, which means if there *was* nowhere that those guns were easier to obtain....

The only reason I ask is I'm fairly familiar with the Kurdish genocide and serious discrimination in Iraq... I lived in Nashville (huge Kurdish population), and a lot of them moved there in the 1980s. They've always stressed that they should have their own country made of regions in other countries.

t3_687btl	t1_dgwawi0	1493438112	Kurds are not terrorists. As far as I know the Kurds have been rock-solid consistent allies in the fight against Isis, as they are pound for pound some some of the toughest sons of bitches on the planet. Even their women are fierce fighters, beautiful and [badass](https://www.google.com/search?q=kurdish+female+fighters&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4n8iw4cjTAhUKwWMKHb2dCEYQsAQIMg&amp;biw=2400&amp;bih=1235), and an especial affront to the dark age Islamic fundamentalism of the average poorly trained Isis recruit. Apparently it is really bad form to get shot multiple times by someone who should be home hiding their face behind opaque layers of cloth. Being stateless, the Kurds take special offense at random Islamic State guys setting up camp in their temporary back yard.	FriesWithThat	t1_dgwa8xe

Aside from the brief stuff I've read, everything about Kurds that I know comes from the guys I know. They used to (illegally I think) send money back to their communities to continue the fight.

t3_687btl	t1_dgwcn9p	1493441233	&gt; though I know Turkey has a different opinion  Probably because murdering Kurds is practically an officially sanctioned pastime in Turkey, and pretty much has been for centuries (well, technically, it was the Ottoman Empire for a lot of that time, but y'know).  I mean, as recently as 1999, Akin Birdal, the co-founder and former President of the Turkish Human Rights Association, was imprisoned in 1999 for "inciting racial hatred" for calling for "peace and understanding" between the Turks and the Kurds in 1996, after saying in 1995, "In a system where the imperialist and socialist worlds exist, wars continue and the bloodiest war is in our country. We have reacted against the Serbian brutality over the Bosnian people. However, some of us ignored this dirty war which is against the human dignity. We have observed the consequences of an unjust and dirty war in the country. This war has continued for 11 years as the rights of the Kurdish people have not been recognised. 20,000 persons died as a result of this dirty war. 118 villages were burned down. Kurdish people were thrown out of their villages, off their land. The Kurdish problem exists in Turkey. Turks should also recognise this problem. Turkey is now at a critical point. Solution of the Kurdish problem in a just, democratic and peaceful way has now become a reality in everybody's mind. Then, why do they still want to continue this dirty war? This war caused the displacement of the Kurdish people from their land. Is this war only the problem of the Kurdish people? Is this week of peace only for the Kurdish people? No, it is a problem for the Turkish people, too."  Actually, he's been imprisoned multiple times since then over basically the same charges.	NonHomogenized	t1_dgwb2wa

t3_67t61l	t1_dgwdiug	1493442989	Okay, I'm actually a catholic Christian and I can tell you what my church believes for good or bad. The good stuff is that we are very pro family! We do a lot to support kids, support unwed moms and support the poor. We donate money and items and food, and do a lot of charity. There are all kinds of programs to support strong marriages and families, and lots of community support. And of course you are aware of the selfless nuns etc who devote their lives to working with the poor.   The kinda bad thing is, that since the church believes life begins at conception, they are opposed to any birth control method that prevents implantation, such as an IUD. That leaves stuff like abstinence and condoms which aren't the most effective. Also, part of our marriage vows are to "accept children willingly from God". So Catholics want to make more babies, but they do support them!   I also spent some time in a Bible study with evangelical protestants. And I used to listen to Christian radio broadcasts. I will tell you that the most truly religious ppl....the ones who actually go to church and study the Bible etc....are people who truly strive to follow Jesus and the early Christian principles of helping one another. They don't want anyone to die! And they also believe the passages in the Bible that tell us God formed us in the womb and knew us before we were born.   I think the ones who are "pharisees " are the ppl who claim to be Christian....but either do not go to church at all, or just go at Christmas to be seen....those like Trump who obviously don't read the Bible (2corinthians trump) or for whatever (political) reason claim to be Christian but are not really.   In any case, I do not believe any of these ppl actually want to kill women. At best, they just don't understand the issues. It's ignorance rather than intent. It just doesn't make any sense for anyone to want to kill women. No man would want to live on a planet without women. Lol	rush42	t1_dgw5588

For the record, I went most of my life thinking the stories my grandfather (who died in the early 1980s) told me about having fairly recent Cheyenne ancestry were true. It took a DNA test when I was in my 40s for me to be informed that my grandfather was either not being truthful, or had been deceived himself. The people who did the ancestry search said many families have false tales of their heritage passed down from generation to generation, and often that includes the belief that there's Native American, Viking, Mongol, Hun, or Conquistador heritage in the family.   I bet most of the people calling Warren "Pocahontas" (which, by the way, is being used as a racist slur that is fairly offensive to Native Americans) would be really surprised if they took the DNA test and had their ancestry traced. The heritage they think they're proud of might be a lie, and lots of them would be pretty pissed to find that they have at least 1% African ancestry. (We all do)	ZeroCorpse	t1_dgwek41
t3_687fh0	t1_dgxiytn	1493517383	That's really interesting, how the Soviets "uncovered" the Hitler story, then investigated. Wow.  I am starting to wonder if "Active Measures" are the source of many big US conspiracy theories. Or also that "smaller" secret misdeeds of the US are being picked up by foreign powers, exposed, and potentiated through propaganda.  I think the Roswell incident is an excellent example of how a foreign power could *theoretically* force a domestic coverup, intrigue, and mistrust.   Something probably did happen in Roswell that was weird. Makes more sense to me that it would be some sort of psyops, not advanced aliens sending meat bodies to Earth only to crash and burn.  Logically, knowing what we do now, why would space aliens send flesh to another planet? Just wormhole-camstream that shit! Send robots! Yet we do have eyewitness accounts of living beings recovered from the site.  What would play better with the public? Cause less panic? a UFO "conspiracy theory" (CIA-coined term), or an admission that Russians had infiltrated our airspace and dropped some of their half-alive human genetic experiments on us?  Applying the ol' Razor, IF something weird dropped in Roswell, it is much more likely of terrestrial origin.  Listen to Clinton Watts's testimony before the Senate.

I thought his best joke was actually imitating Wolf calling is his Uber driver transportation expert. Genuinely laughed at that, because it does feel that way when watching CNN. That's quality satire.   And his best line on Trump was simply making fun of how he refused to show up, highlighting his cowardice.	OldTrafford25	t3_68deo3

It's one thing to say that you are going after the "bad hombres", but lumping all Mexicans (and all immigrants for that matter) into the category of unwanted snakes that will try to charm you then viciously attack you is just so damaging.

t3_68deo3	t1_dgxmrai	1493523604	By your standards. Comedy isn't objective.

t3_68cpqh	t1_dgxn0ko	1493524064	There's also another component I don't think many people are remembering. Nothing of this scale has ever happened before. There's no precedent for this.   So not only will those making the case need to make sure it sticks, they'll also likely have to propose how to go about fixing the damage and preventing it in the future. I mean, how do you go about removing (presumably) an entire administration all while dealing with the fact we've essentially been attacked or invaded in a way we've never seen before? How will the country function under such cataclysmic evidence, *especially* since a sizable part of the population has been trained to reject factual negativity at all costs? What do you do with those in the party that supported him and probably obstructed justice?   There will be a huge fallout and they know it. I imagine, if they are really trying to help the country, they will propose a method of dealing with it to avoid a government shutdown, widescale violence, and outright denial or continued obstruction.

I think Trevor Noah is a hack and could turn a clown college into a funeral home. Comedy is either good or bad, whether you agree with its content or not shouldn't matter.

t3_68deo3	t1_dgxpzhb	1493529904	&gt; Comedy is either good or bad, whether you agree with its content or not shouldn't matter.  Well -- because Politics and personal identity are intertwined.  Jokes about the representative of your "team" can sometimes fall flat because the comedian has made you feel (fairly or unfairly) personally maligned.  That's why jokes about abortion wouldn't work in a room full of Nuns.   Consider this ---  you didn't just think his performance was unfunny...you have already left 4-5 comments declaring that Hasan bombed.  Why so many?  Perhaps because you are a life-long connoisseur of comedy and it deeply offends you that his "Not see" joke was a shitty pun?  If that were the case, I'd imagine you are someone who regularly comments about different comedians and how they fared...  Nope.  The only other time you commented on anything comedy related: when [you defended Trump's statement that Hilary started the birther movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/53n9pj/did_trump_end_the_birther_controversy_or_is_that/d7uyrmz/) after someone posted a Colbert clip to /r/television.

t3_68cpqh	t1_dgxqasm	1493530610	It's all about how the individuals in power "stack the deck".   The reason why cops rarely get indicted is because there is just enough public outcry concerning the actions of an officer that an additional level of "oversight" is needed to appease the masses.   So a grand jury gives the *appearance* that the ruling class is seeking "Justice". Then on a Friday before a holiday weekend they'll quietly issue a press release stating that the grand jury didn't indict the officers.   Grand juries are mostly used as a "damage control" mechanism when cops are involved.   So it just depends on how driven a prosecutor is.   With these cases it very well could be a ruse to sweep this Russia stuff under the rug but I have feeling that the ruling class isn't thrilled with the destabilizing, unpredictable Trump administration injecting uncertainty into ever aspect of American lives ranging from healthcare and social issues all the way up to trade and international diplomacy.   So this gives me hope that we'll see a dismantling of the Trump administration (indictments of Trump's goons).   By the ruling class, in this instance, I'm talking about true power in the upper levels of world society - domestic and overseas. Power that doesn't give a shit whether a leftist Dem or far-right neo-conservative is in office and they donate to both sides. They want predictability, stability and certainty and a Trump is failing in all these areas that the ruling class *really* cares about.	NAmember81	t1_dgxogd1

Every president since Reagan has financed their retirement not off of a governmental stipend, or a higher salary during holding office, but on book sales and speaking engagements.   3) If you're against government corruption (or the trendy term "pay for play"), this is not applicable to you. Obama is out of office. These engagements were not set during this time in office. He did not use his leverage as the chief executive to make policy in order to achieve these payments.  So my question would be: what should he do? Would you oppose him writing books? Becoming a partner at a law firm? Getting a job at McDonalds?

It is like what happens when a sudden and serious mental illness befalls a prominent family, the tendency is to collectively adapt, paint the best picture, accommodate in subtle ways just to preserve one's own sanity.

You do realize that the constitution applies to EVERYONE. Those rights enshrined in our founding document do not apply to only American citizens, they apply to everyone. The constitution says that it will guarantee those rights, not that they are bestowed as a benefit of citizenship.  &gt; In the United States, non-citizens are persons who do not have U.S. citizenship, including lawful permanent residents, refugees and asylum seekers, persons who have permission to come to the U.S. for reasons like work, school or travel, and those without legal immigration status of any kind. Non-citi- zens who are in the United States—no matter what their immi- gration status—generally have the same constitutional rights as citizens when law enforcement officers stop, question, arrest, or search them or their homes.   https://www.aclu.org/files/kyr/kyr_english_4.pdf	evilrobotdrew1	t1_dgy5kwl

t3_68d48y	t1_dgy9wax	1493573102	So here's the thing, right?  Obama came into office during the recession of 2008 and 2009. The Credit Crunch was devastating, and when he came into office, the declines in US growth and employment were not unlike those seen at the beginning of the Great Recession.  Since then, Obama drove a recovery of 2.1% per annum over 7 years - a record recovery. He also created 15.8 million jobs (over 2 million per annum), getting unemployment down to 4.7% and increasing manufacturing jobs by close to 1,000,000.  Wage growth went up by 0.8% - the fastest since the 70s.  Oh yes, and he halved the percentage of people without health insurance.  So when you say he was awful, I read that as "He wasn't on my team, and no amount of facts will get me to give an inch of ground."  Go team, right?	Daddingly	t1_dgy87fa

He can't fill positions because the only way he can trust people is if they are on the take and compromised by foreign governments.    He's flailed with the power given him and wants more power?  He's fleeced the country, while loopholing his way out of any responsibility and now wants more money?  He's had media completely ignoring blatant treason and he wants legal changes so he's never exposed.    It's his own incompetence that has been his biggest limitation.

t3_68f7gx	t1_dgybvjc	1493575626	nice job avoiding your mistake lol. You said getting admitted into America is a natural right. America is not for everyone. I'd rather focus on the 50% of the country living in third world conditions before I open my doors to foreigners. More than 54% also supported the refugee ban.  There have been numerous studies showing that sending money to help Syrians is much more effective than bringing them over here.   This isn't about immigrants, it's about refugees. But if you want to get into immigrants, lets get into it.  "This nation has never opened it's doors to unskilled immigrants, certainly not to unskilled immigrants who are facing a humanitarian crisis." &lt;-- That's a joke right? Is that why over 71% of legal Mexicans and Central Americans end up on welfare? Or what about the 51% of legal African immigrants?  "Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that there are some 58 million working-age (16 to 65) native-born Americans not working — unemployed or out of the labor market entirely. This is roughly 16 million more than in 2000. Equally troubling, wages have stagnated or declined for most American workers. This is especially true for the least educated, who are most likely to compete with immigrants (legal and illegal)." - NY times https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/01/06/do-immigrants-take-jobs-from-american-born-workers/unskilled-workers-lose-out-to-immigrants   "We are a nation of immigrants,” we are often told by the most affluent and educated segments of our society, who face the least competition from immigrants, so we shouldn't restrict immigration or enforce our laws. But this ignores the very real harm to poorer Americans affected by current high levels of immigration."  America was great, until we ignored everyone but the rich. Half of Americans are in need, but you don't care. I'm sure that in your eyes, you see these foreigners as more American than these foreign born American who need our help.   How long until we close our doors? I'm sure that if liberals had complete control, they would invite the entire world inside. Just spouting "we are a nation of immigrants, so we should never stop taking in immigrants" is bullshit rhetoric that only and always hurts the lower class.   We are a sovereign nation with huge poverty statistics, and we have every right to turn away foreigners from coming into this country. That doesn't make me xenophobic, it just means I care about Americans and legal immigrants already here over others.	RonPaul2020plz	t1_dgybbyq

I mean, you claim that America is safer than Europe, and a lot of the "articles" you posted touch on that, but they talk about it strictly in the realm of terrorism, not a overall sense of safety. Yet you use them to claim America is safer. What about gun violence? Sexual assault? White collar crime? But wait, here you come with an article about a refugee who commits a crime, uses it to demonize all muslims, then wonders why we downvote you for being a bigot (and you proved it by brushing off our higher crime rate and blaming it on the inner cities).

t3_68hpxv	t1_dgynsif	1493591102	Ok story time. For privacy we were going to say that I had an employee named Maria. Now Maria was a decent employee, showed up on time and did her work well enough. Maria was hired and she brought in her state issued drivers licence and Social Security card for her i-9 and her W-2. Everything checks out, she's been employed with us for about 4-5 months. Maria has two kids born in the US, goes to school, everyone speaks English, pays her taxes. All and all she's a great lady whose been in the USA for 12 years.  Now one morning we get a phone call from a woman in Idaho. Our restaurant is located in Louisiana. She calls and says do you have a "Maria" that works there? The GM says yes (I'm sitting next to him in our tiny ass kitchen office so I hear all of this as it goes down). At first we both think oh no, she's gonna quit and this is a reference call! Then the lady tell us that her father "Bob Jones" is 80 something years old and in poor health. She went to sign her elderly father up for Medicaid and Medicare but was denied. So now we are confused, what does this have to do with anything? Me and the GM are kinda looking at each other like Ok where is she going with this. Well says "Bob's" daughter, he was denied because his tax records say "Bob" has been gainfully employed for the past 12 years at various places and the most recent is our restaurant. As proof of the call she offered his SS# for us to cross reference our system and see if any employee is using that number. (Please note that we did not offer any information other than yes, "Maria" worked there) she proceeds to tell us the number as well as Maria's paid taxes. She also provides us with the case number and officer assigned to the case in Louisiana with the federal office bc this is identify theft occurring across state lines.   After we get off the phone we Google the office she told us to make sure we weren't just taking her word for it and everything checks out. Before contacting them we called our HR and we're told to release the employee immediately. We bring her in and try to explain to her why we are firing her. We asked her to leave immediately and informed her we would have to report this information to the officers in charge of the investigation.   Now this part has always stick with me and really made me realize how many illegal immigrants don't get it. "Maria" then says that all of this is a lie. She came into the US legally. She "bought all of the correct paper work like her lawyer in Mexico told her to 12 years ago". She was scammed in Mexico by a fake lawyer who sold her fake papers that she thought was the correct way to immigrate.   The cops came by a little after that day and told us if we ever see her again to call immediately and they will arrest her. Her sister came by a day or two after to kinda fight us about it all, saying we made it all up. She didn't believe us till we showed her the police stuff. It was all really sad.  Lesson I learned was a bunch of the illegal immigrants are using someone else's information to be here (from conversation with our other employees concerned about ICE coming after this) Sure they are paying taxes to do so but they are stealing someone's credit, life, or benefits. Alot of the time this person has to fight identity theft or families have to repeatedly prove a family member is dead and not working in a state they never even visited. *Not saying all are doing this, just saying a lot are that have never done any malicious crime on purpose*  Tl:dr-find out a great immigrant employee is using someone else's identity and didn't even know it.	chf_stf	t3_68hpxv

t3_68f7gx	t1_dgyos2b	1493592504	I pointed out from multiple links that Europe is at a much higher risk than the USA because they take in hordes of refugees.   I don't know how closely you follow this, but you need to read up on Calais. Every "refugee" ends up going there for a chance to sneak into England. These refugees don't care about safety, they want more. There are thousands of videos on youtube where migrants on the highway in Calais are terrorizing people driving by so they can jump onto the trucks that cross over into England. I'm not a sadistic. I hate seeing people suffer from evil. My family has been to trips to Africa and South America countless times to help out those in need. But when people want luxury over safety, then a problem arises. It's sad that thousands upon thousands come through Germany, Italy and France just to go to England. England's refugees are better off than all (but the US. the ones that make it to the US are the best off). If it is safety they want, it's not hard to achieve. You aren't seeing millions of Europeans turn against refugees and the EU because they're racist, but they legitimately have concerns. Many interviews have been conducted with these refugees trying to sneak in to the UK. A lot of the answers are similar. "They will give a better house.", "they will give me an iphone", "they will pay for my car", "they will give me more money".  " Many who live in this camp attempted to illegally enter the United Kingdom via the Port of Calais or the Eurotunnel by stowing away on lorries, ferries, cars, or trains travelling to the UK." - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calais_Jungle#cite_note-2  http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29074736  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/calais-residents-protest-jungle-refugee-camp-not-racist-problem-getting-worse  https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/opinion/crisis-in-calais.html  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/calais-refugee-crisis-how-the-authorities-failed-the-children-of-the-jungle-and-how-volunteers-were-a7386921.html  http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/09/13/493721794/for-one-french-woman-an-eye-opening-visit-to-calais-refugee-jungle	RonPaul2020plz	t1_dgyldoz

This line of thinking is dangerous. A lot of people have genuine conservative opinioms and enthusiastically vote Republican because fhey agree with them. Bernie and any other progressives are going to continue to lose if they don't realize that many people aren't willing to give up their convictions, indeed their whole identities, for policies that may technically benefit them.	takeashill_pill	t1_dgynjxk
t3_68i7mt	t1_dgyoy6n	1493592747	A much simpler answer:  The Democratic party just has to show up.    In so many districts/locales the Dems don't even make an effort to win over voters, even with moderate positions/candidates.  They don't make an effort to appeal to voters in rural America in particular.  So often they just write those voters off, call them "a lost cause" or the like, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  And even when they do contest an area, it's with a candidate so bland and milquetoast that no-one but already-engaged politicos is compelled to give a shit.  It's not so much about being more "progressive" but about providing and articulating a real alternative to the Republicans (as opposed to republican-lite; there *is* a difference).  It's about presenting your case and actually trying to win over voters.  It's about demonstrating to voters that you actually understand their concerns and will take real steps to address them in real ways,  with real actions instead of empty platitudes and recycled bromides that people have heard for 25 years running and stopped caring about long ago.  It's about showing up.  This is what many of the party's leaders don't understand:  It's not the voters' job to show up for you; It's your job to show up for the voters.	TheEdIsNotAmused	t3_68i7mt

The opposition to the wealth and income gap is strong and bipartisan, and all the lobbying money in the world can't overturn voters who have found "their battle" to fight.

Drunk driving is their cultural problem; well, they do not see it as a problem, but it is considered a serious problem in this country.  I've had arguments with Latinos.  They seem to think DUI is trivial and should not be a ground for deportation.  I disagreed, of course.  I do not see why we should change our cultural norms to adopt to theirs and accept drunk driving as okay.  Anyway, if we just focus on rooting out and deporting illegal immigrants who drink and drive, we should be able to get rid of a whole lot of them.

t3_68i7mt	t1_dgyrazh	1493596047	"Republicans" has two different groups, "Republican elites" and politicians in government, and "Republican voters". I think the voters support the Republican plan to fix things because Democrats haven't offered a counter, or a candidate to follow through on that counter. The Sanders wing offered one, and the Democratic party leadership turned it down. _Why?_  My theory is that among Democrats, there are similarly "Democratic elites", which encompass much of Democratic political leadership, and "Democratic voters". I'd guess that "Democratic elites" and "Republican elites" have a lot more in common than we like to think; my hope is that 2018 and 2020 will demonstrate that their time has passed.  EDIT: Sorry, argument wasn't actually very clear. I hypothesize a group of "Sanders voters", who encompass subsets of both "Democratic voters" and "Republican voters", and that if the Democratic party pivots to bring in these voters, they will (1) win resoundingly in 2018 and 2020, and (2) actually fight against the threat facing the middle class today.	henryptung	t1_dgypn24

t3_68hpxv	t1_dgytzfp	1493599818	Undocumented immigrants are the true waste of resources. Overall, there is an overall cost of illegal immigration, experts just can't decide on how big it is. Conservative groups such as FAIR put it at $113 billion a year. That's totally an overestimate, but the CBO has said that it's definatly a net loss. Yes, many pay taxes and yes, they don't all receive the same benefits that citizens are eligible for, but they pay less in taxes than citizens with the same income and they can still receive some social services.  I agree that increasing ICE's presence is a waste of resources because we should have taken action to make sure that this many illegal immigrants never came here in the first place. Things like E-verify would have helped. It turns out that strong rhetoric (Trump) will also decrease border crossings.  Hopefully Trumps immigration policies will be successful, but there needs to be punishment for illegal immigration as well as deterrence.  The irony is that Trump is expending resources to remove people who are, overall, wasting resources.	Dubs0	t1_dgyqa07

The progressive media said all that shit.  &gt;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi downplayed the significance of the right to an abortion as a cause that unites Democrats, emphasizing instead the party’s stance on economic policy and commitment to the working class. Asked Sunday whether there’s room in the party for pro-life politicians, the staunchly pro-choice California lawmaker responded, “Of course.”  &gt;“I have served many years in Congress with members who have not shared my very positive — my family would say ‘aggressive’ — position on promoting a woman’s right to choose,” Ms. Pelosi said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”   &gt;The remark comes after Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont Independent, stumped on Thursday for Omaha mayoral candidate Heath Mello, a Democrat who supported pro-life legislation as a Nebraska senator.   &gt;Mr. Mello initially received an endorsement in the May 9 election from the Daily Kos, a progressive website, but lost it after his pro-life voting record, which includes co-sponsoring the state’s 20-week abortion ban, came to light.   http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/23/nancy-pelosi-abortion-stance-democrats-can-be-pro-/  Yeah, that Pelosi that's getting a Bernie-style primary challenge.

BTW, if an illegal alien really strives to improve his life, then he should not drink and drive and endanger other people's lives while he is already illegally in the country.  I can forgive someone who is illegally here - *as long as he has not broken any other criminal or serious law.*  DUI is a serious crime that puts other people's lives in danger.  Any illegal aliens who have committed a DUI, who shows no consideration for the lives and safety of American people, should be deported.  Those are the bad ones.  Let's get rid of them.	ktchong	t1_dgyujjq

t3_68hpxv	t1_dgyvjny	1493601943	&gt; Why should Mexicans have to deal with the danger of his drunk driving instead of us? What makes them inherently more deserving of dealing with the relative danger he poses than us? That they happened to be born in the same geographic area as him?  *His* drunk driving.  He drank, and he drove.  He committed the crime - a serious crime that endangered other people, that put the lives of other people at risk.   He alone, not any other people, was the one who committed the act.  Therefore, he should be the one who faces the full consequences for his action - and deportation is a part of those consequences when he is illegally here.	ktchong	t1_dgyvem9
t3_68hpxv	t1_dgyvnjt	1493602083	Why deportation instead of the normal punishment a citizen should face? Obviously he should be punished somehow but why does moving him from the population on one side of a border to that on the other constitute justice?	Akton	t1_dgyvjny
t3_68hpxv	t1_dgyvp5y	1493602141	Because he is illegally here.  Deportation *is* the punishment for unlawful presence in the country.  We actually do not need any other excuse or reason to deport an illegal alien.  The unlawful presence itself is the ground for deportation.  However, I can forgive someone who illegally entered or stayed this country - *as long as he has not committed any actual crime.*  DUI is an actual crime that puts other people's lives at risk, and DUI *does* kill people.  So, if an illegal alien has committed a crime atop of being illegally here, then he should be punished for that crime *and* also be deported for the unlawful presence.  He must be deported because he has become undesirable: he has shown that he is a public safety.  He has shown that he has put at risk the lives of other people.	ktchong	t1_dgyvnjt
t3_68hpxv	t1_dgyvviu	1493602359	The purpose of this dialectic I'm trying to engage in is to question the moral basis of the concept of lawful/unlawful presence in a country in the first place. Why does a person born on one side of the border who drives drunk in the USA get punished with deportation (imprisonment in Mexico, a very nasty punishment) but someone born on the other doesn't? What is the actual basis in justice of such a standard?	Akton	t1_dgyvp5y
t3_68hpxv	t1_dgyw0p3	1493602533	Because citizens have certain rights, and illegal aliens do not have those same rights.  Illegal aliens do not have some legel rights,   Citizens have the right to vote.  Illegal aliens do not.    Citizens have the right to be here.  Illegal aliens do not.  Again, illegal aliens do *not* have the right to be here, just as they do *not* have the right to vote.  There are just certain rights that illegal aliens do not have.     &gt;However, I can forgive someone who illegally entered or stayed this country - *as long as he has not committed any actual crime.*  DUI is an actual crime that puts other people's lives at risk, and DUI *does* kill people.  So, once an illegal alien has committed a crime, then he should be punished for that crime *and* also deported for unlawful presence.  He must be deported because he has become undesirable and a liability: he has shown that he is a public safety.  He has shown that he has put at risk the lives of other people.	ktchong	t1_dgyvviu

t3_68f7gx	t1_dgyyoeh	1493606162	It's 36%, according to the Breitbart article I'm assuming you cited. And "immigrant origin" =/= foreign born. It's called "migrant background" and that includes people who have at least one parent who wasn't born a naturalized German citizen (meaning it includes certain people whose parents were both born in Germany).  What was going to be "really rough" in a few decades for Germans was trying to sort out their demographic crisis -- their population has been aging for quite some time and, as you pointed out, the birth rate has been low, creating a shortage of young, working-age people. Encouraging migration to Germany has been a thing for quite some time; a whopping majority of those "migrant background" people living in Germany right now don't have Syrian or Iraqi or even Turkish origin -- they have European origin. Germany (and West Germany) has accepted Poles, Russians, Italians, Romanians, Greeks, Croats, Serbians, Kosovars, Ukranians, etc, at various times throughout the last half century or longer.  The people who will be a burden on this welfare structure are, for the most part, not the migrants and refugees fleeing to Germany. It's the fast-growing group of people who are too old to work (and therefore go from being people who paid into the welfare state to people who benefit from it). Attracting young, skilled workers who will pay taxes helps solve this demographic problem. Basically, the *exact* kind of people the German economy is looking for are educated workers in places like Homs and Aleppo (yes, there are a lot of them) who can't work in their home country anymore for obvious reasons.   Basically, the fact that people of migrant background make-up a significant minority of newborn Germans should bode well for Germany's future.	TrynnaFindaBalance	t1_dgydjmu

And many universities have simply failed to do so.  What should have been a teachable moment where students learned a valuable lesson instead reinforces bad behavior that, frankly, is going to cause them no end of problems.

t3_68jrh1	t1_dgz1vo5	1493611104	Yeah, I get the internal logic, but if they're spewing hate and lies for fun instead of a deeply held belief, they're even more morally reprehensible.

t3_68jrh1	t1_dgz2p6e	1493612573	The distinction is motive.  Which yeah, I get that can be irrelevant to a lot of people, but the end goals are different.  Stormfront has white supremacist motives, whereas 4chan and pol see white supremacy as one of their tools to swindle and get a reaction out of the media.    The end-goal is convincing liberals and news reporters that a hand gesture that everyone uses (whether it be a-OK, thumbs up, or the peace sign) is coded nazi language	pantsfish	t1_dgz1ox1
t3_68h9ev	t1_dgz2v0k	1493612870	Or the direct opposite. "Bush was a war criminal, got us embroiled a war in Iraq based on lies, and helped usher in the 2008 financial crisis...but Trump is so much worse I'd take GW back in a heartbeat."	mmmsoap	t1_dgyvepx

t3_68jrh1	t1_dgz2wpd	1493612955	Two months ago 4chan came up with a fake nazi origin for the a-OK handsign, complete with pamphlets and flyers to convince people on white supremacy forums that it's a new signal for white power  Having gotten a half-dozen or so genuine racists to do this, they then came up with a "Not OK" anti-racism counter-campaign to ban the hand gesture.  Effectively convincing some journalists that the hand sign is coded language, essentially conning them into accusing random people using the OK hand gesture that they're in on some white nationalist cabal.  It's one thing to accuse a pundit of being a closeted nazi, but they tricked the media into making the accusation for them  Imagine what it would take to convince a journalist that the thumbs-up is a white power signal.

t3_68jrh1	t1_dgz3vzr	1493614897	Yes, they got white supremacists to use it by creating a fake nazi origin, complete with flags and a fake history of Hitler inventing it to signal white power (which is false).  Once some stormfronters bought into it and started talking about it on their forums, they took screenshots to use as evidence for their fake "Not OK" anti-racism campaign against it.  With the end goal of conning the media into accusing unaware third-parties of being white supremacists.  The number of people sincerely using it to signal white power can be counted on one hand, and they exist as pawns of a larger campaign.  They did it at the expense of stormfront members, the media, and Mike Cernovich.	pantsfish	t1_dgz3mgn

The difference between /pol/ and stormfront is that the latter is filled with genuine white supremacists, while /pol/ just sees white supremacy as a useful tool to manipulate reactions from the media.

You said "shouting down"  In almost any normal context, that sort of 'speech' would get you arrested for disturbing the peace.  Antagonizing people in this fashion is not protected speech - and it is especially damaging to intellectual fabric of a university.  Students who engage in it should be instructed that they are acting unacceptably and should cease their harassment of others if they wish to remain students at the university.  If you want to make a loud disturbance in a public space, you need to apply for a permit to do precisely that.  Bear in mind that public spaces are *shared* spaces and you need to acknowledge others use of that space.  You seem to imagine that 'freedom of speech' means you get to say whatever you want, whenever you want, however you want - and that everyone else just needs to shut up.  That's not actually the way it works.  &gt; Every single person protested by antifa activists has been some manner of authoritarian racist. Every single fucking one.  Really?

So basically you're saying that anarchy is where the left and right meet on one end of the circle, while the conjunction of right leaning or left leaning authoritarian control is at the opposing point.   Regardless, the left in America isn't anarchists. Antifa aren't a political party, but instead kids who want to seem badass and don't understand how immature they look.   Don't meet the trumpet morons with violence, meet them with humor. They can't handle humor.

You also need to recognize that when it occurs on a college campus, you are only in quasi-public space.  Universities can set rules for behavior - and they almost always do.  So while people have gotten away with it, a university absolutely can arrest someone for that behavior, they can expel someone for that behavior and they *should* do so.  it is an abdication of their authority to allow a 'speech only for the loudest voice' method of debate.  &gt; So let me get this straight: you think people only have constitutional rights if they get pre-approval to practice them from the government?  Public spaces are shared spaces.  As a result, your rights are dependent on the needs other people have for those spaces.  This really isn't a complex concept and it's been the way it has worked since before the nation was founded.  &gt; Don't shove a camera in the face of the man smashing the bank window, protip for life right there. He does not want to be filmed.  This does not make his actions legal.  &gt; Anyway, everybody who voted for Trump got wooed by white nationalist bullshit. This is fact. They should be confronted with that fact 24/7.  Yes, and all Jews are vermin.  We all know how you people like you think.  &gt; Is that supposed to be some sort of veiled threat?  No, it's supposed to be a hard dose of reality.  The kids making up 'antifa' have been sheltered their whole life and don't quite realize that they're not up for this.

Yes, it will tear families apart. No, I do not feel bad about that. You shouldn't be rewarded with asylum just because you cleverly planned your pregnancy in order to manipulate the system. If we don't set a precedent now then it makes it that much easier for truly undesirable folk to just walk right in and feel safe, even protected from any legal recourse.   I couldn't travel to France or something and just start over because I don't like how things are going here in the US.. it doesn't work that way. Even if I had never committed a crime anywhere in the world and I traveled with a passport issued by my country of origin, which I highly doubt many illegal immigrants are doing, it would still be a crime unless I went through the process to become a legal citizen. Do you think anyone in France would be upset about it? Perhaps the expats now living in France? Hell no!  Sure.. our president is making some absolutely terrible decisions that will likely plague our country for decades, but this is pretty standard stuff. Right, guys? Why the outrage? Maybe we should focus a little less of our energy on the totally legal and justifiable decision to actually crack down on immigration like we've been talking about doing for years and focus a bit more on the other, insanely illegal and downright crooked, bs that he pulls on a daily basis.

No one, not a single historian, looked into the causes of the Civil War. But now that he's looked into it and started a discussion on it, the "truth" will start to come out.

They are getting death threats, being called crazy, their pictures are being stolen and used for fake dummy sites and social media accounts such as twitter and FB clones.   There are armies of paid trolls who are specifically tasked with this kind of thing. As well as rabid Trump supporters with too much free time who consider it their civic duty to harass anyone who displays disloyalty.

t3_68lnpt	t1_dgzqect	1493659121	&gt; Trump, in other words, is pushing for legislation he hasn’t read and doesn’t understand – which was a problem in March, when the president’s ignorance was so profound he couldn’t even negotiate with lawmakers, and it’s just as glaring a problem now.  We've had presidents who were portrayed as idiots by the media before.  But never has that portrayal been really accurate, until now.  Gerald Ford tripped once, then got lampooned as a klutz for years afterwards - especially by [Chevy Chase.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF98NkctXDU)  George W. Bush was perceived as an idiot, mainly because he wasn't the best at public speaking.  In both cases, a single gaffe, or a string of minor gaffes gave the media a little something they could exaggerate.  Now, however, we have a president who truly is an idiot.  There's no need for the media to exaggerate it at all, because he proves how willfully ignorant and unprepared he is about practically everything on a weekly - if not daily - basis.  All anyone has to do is listen to or read the transcript to any of his interviews or press conferences, and it becomes abundantly clear that he has no idea what he's talking about.  He didn't bother to read the legislation he's trying to push.  He didn't know that being president would be hard, or that healthcare would be so complicated.  He believed that Korea used to be part of China, probably because he misunderstood something President Xi Jingping said via a translator.  He incorrectly thought that he had the biggest electoral college win since Reagan, because "that's what he was told".    This motherfucker doesn't read, he doesn't like preparing for anything, and he can't even be bothered to look anything up on Wikipedia before he starts quoting it as fact.  He hears something, and if he likes it, he believes it to be true.  This is the kind of moron who is now one of the most powerful people on the planet.	TJ_McWeaksauce	t3_68lnpt

t3_68ma96	t1_dgzqrfu	1493659540	So last week, [ASEAN had a meeting](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-asean-summit-idUSKBN17W02E) in which [they removed the statement that opposes China's territory claims in SCS.](http://www.manilatimes.net/asean-softens-china-stand-us-belatedly-beckons/325041/)   &gt;such subdued voicing of concern over Chinese actions was missing from this year’s statement, issued Sunday in Manila after the 30th summit was held under the chairmanship of the Philippines.  &gt;A chairman's statement of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) was released about 12 hours after the summit ended, and dropped references to "land reclamation and militarization" included in the text issued at last year's meeting, and in an earlier, unpublished version seen by Reuters on Saturday.  On Saturday, Trump talks with Duterte and the press release from the white house says they had a productive talk with Manila and [will be meeting with Duterte.](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/30/politics/philippines-duterte-trump/) [Another article claims the call was meant to counter China's growing influence.] (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/us/politics/trump-duterte.html?_r=0)  &gt;**Administration officials said the call to Mr. Duterte was one of several to Southeast Asian leaders that the White House arranged after picking up signs that the leaders felt neglected because of Mr. Trump’s intense focus on China, Japan and tensions over North Korea. On Sunday, Mr. Trump spoke to the prime ministers of Singapore and Thailand; both got White House invitations.**  Let this sink in. This was not the only call Trump made, he made calls to several leaders this weekend after the ASEAN summit. The fact that no countries, including the White House, has released a statement saying these leaders have accepted his invitations is very telling.  &gt; Mr. Trump’s cultivation of Mr. Duterte has a strategic rationale, officials said. Mr. Duterte has pivoted away from the United States, a longtime treaty ally, and toward China.  &gt; Administration officials said Mr. Trump wanted to mend the alliance with the Philippines as a bulwark against China’s expansionism in the South China Sea.  [But he didn't clear it with State Department,](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/331319-trump-invited-duterte-to-white-house-without-telling-state-department) which make me believe that the invitation was made during the call itself.   Now, we hear that Duterte "can't make it."   My own analysis: WE are losing the Pacific. Trump is losing the Pacific to China and it's Hail Mary time. Duterte, the one leader that would arguably be the easiest to win over,  JUST DECLINED. Trump said during his campaign that the whole world is laughing at us. Now they are. And in an attempt to shore up relations, Trump calls each leader in the Pacific to win them back. Master negotiator he is, Trump can't do that over the phone since he needs to give him a lawnmower handshake or cheat at golf to regain dominance. Trump tries what he can to get Duterte to the white house and back in the US ' camp, pulling out all the stops, making accommodations his ass can't cash, even bypassing the State department when he threw out his invitation. And now, Duterte snubs him publicly, saying he's too busy to meet with the President of the United States?  So to the Trump supporters, if you have a way to spin this, I’d love to hear it. Tell me what the benefits are for America if Trump loses the support of South Korea, and the Phillipines in a single week? How is that going to make America great again?  edit: typing this on phone, will cite all my sources later.	BakedPenna	t1_dgzi8ra

It is in essence government-rationed healthcare - exactly what they (falsely) claimed Obamacare would be. In order for a high-risk pool to work it would require massive subsidies which we all know R's wouldn't support. Unless fully subsidized, state governments will be forced to exclude people from the pool and/or limit individual benefits. This healthcare "solution" does little more than shift the cost burden away from the federal government and insurers back to state and consumers.	chew86	t1_dgzjqak

And what worries me is that most people fall in the 'not-super sick' category, meaning that most people won't mind seeing their premiums go down, even if tens of millions suffer as a result.  I worry that there's a simple question that we as a country haven't answered yet, and that's whether we're going to take care of our sick. The Republicans seem to be saying "no, let the market run its course".	Daotar	t1_dgzghor

t3_68lnpt	t1_dgzsujq	1493661932	I'll offer a different reason--because I don't think that's a high frequency reason (it happens, but isn't that common).  I think it's because people still want to get things done.  He's President and the GOP run the show. Criticizing the President is most likely to get asked to leave the room, get off the project, maybe even resign. Your voice and opinion and influence is set to 0 or maybe creates reaction where he actively avoids it from you or anyone else.  Criticizing the GOP has a high enough chance of either also pissing him off or (possibly) not, but then pissing off the GOP who will not want you interfering or pitting the President against their ideas. They know how easy he could do that.   If you want to get some of your ideas through, criticizing the White House or the GOP isn't necessarily the best tactic.   I think that's why.	jwords	t1_dgzlgn6

Trump had worse ties, but the lies of Fox News and other conservative media--in addition to leaks from WikiLeaks, making Clinton look even more like a corporate shill--all worked together to make establishment Democrats look like the big business party, even if it isn't true. We can demonize Trump until we're blue in the face, but if we don't do anything to appeal to the working class and get rid of this corporate image we have--however real or perceived--the DNC won't get any major wins for a while.

But when you disagree with objective facts, and think your opinion is on par with actual facts, I'm going to assume you're just not a very bright person.

t3_68hpxv	t1_dgzv3to	1493664508	lol don't try and turn this around like I'm blaming the ICE agents doing their job. I never once said the agents on the ground are the problem.   Also, a majority of these Mexicans be deported have been here years, decades in some Instances. What would deporting a person who has little to no ties in their home country do? Besides make people like you feel good about a problem that doesn't exist. Mexicans are not flowing over the border like they were ten years ago. Wouldn't it make more sense to allow them to become legitimate and contribute to the economy. Contrary to popular belief, rich people don't make the economy do, working class people do.	ToastMasterJ	t1_dgzrtn1
t3_68lnpt	t1_dgzv3ws	1493664511	And of course, the way to destroy a market is to add uncertainty, as when Donald threatened not to provide supplementary payments last month.  Worked damn well with oil prices in the decade following the Iraq war.  The whole point of insurance is to take an unpredictable, uncommon, largely random occurrence (getting ill) and amortize it across a population to make it predictable.  One person's chance of getting sick is near unknowable, but a population's rate of illness is knowable.  It's indicative of how bad the Republicans are at governance that they are trying to "fix" the system by making it less stable.	RSquared	t1_dgzoovi

Just murky logic. Or as you like to call it... deflection!  Bernie didn’t lose because of some nonexistent conspiracy, and he didn’t lose because of money. Bernie lost because he couldn’t convince minority voters.   At this point, the Bernie movement has two options.  One is to double down on the failed strategy of going after working class whites in an attempt to remake the Democratic Party in their image.  The second option for is to move into the future. That means to move away from alienating core constituencies of the Democratic Party, and to stop harassing women and minorities online.  So far, all I see, is Bernie, along with his supporters, determined to be remembered as the angry old guy who handed the country to Trump.	spacehogg	t1_dgzong9

Sad reality.  LOL? QUESTION SCIENCE? Yeah, that's a funny way of defending blatant science denial.  These 37 thousand studies say I'm wrong, but I'm just "asking questions" am I right?  You understand there's a difference between "questioning science" and dismissing thousands of credible studies, right?  Vaccines do not cause autism, according to **all credible research.**  That is a god damn fact, if you "question" that you better have credible evidence to support your argument, if not, you're just a science denier.

Do you have any idea how many people still die in those countries to things that can be prevented by vaccines?      http://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/global-immunization/diseases-and-vaccines-world-view  &gt;&gt; Each year, about 85 percent of the world’s children receive vaccines that protect them against tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and measles. These vaccines save about 2.5 million lives, and the hepatitis B vaccine, although not as widely used, saves about 600,000 lives.  &gt;&gt; Despite this success, more than 3 million people die from vaccine-preventable diseases each year. Approximately 1.5 million of these deaths are in children less than 5 years old. Of the top 10 causes of death in those less than 5 years old, several are infectious, meaning they can be transmitted from one person to another.  So yeah.  &gt;&gt; So what other straw man argument would you like to make today? Care to apply any other labels to me?  What science is it you're questioning dude? Becuase I've got news for you, if it's climate change, the science in relation to that is more solid than it is in relation to vaccines.	pizzashill	t1_dgzws3z

Ask any climate scientist if they know about, and account for, the atmospheric modification programs performed by governments across the globe. The answer is no - they have been asked. The United States has literally experimented with heating up the atmosphere to strengthen ground based global communications (not a regional test or program).

Great example of how science can be controlled. We know these atmospheric programs exist, we know they are not exclusively regional or local, and we know climate science doesn't consider any of it.   In spite of all of this you simply dismiss the question, the result is bad science that can't be questioned.   You excel at proving my points though, stick around :)	cerebral_scrubber	t1_dgzy0br

t3_68nj0e	t1_dh048x7	1493674922	IMO the Trump vote that led to the margin of victory was literally a "Fuck Shit Up" vote.  Put the idiot in the white house and watch hilarious shenanigans ensue.  Given that both candidates were promising more neoliberalism and more wealth inequality, and both candidates were effectively for continuing the foreign policy establishment's warmongering, as long as the voter has no direct economic stake in the political process it made literally no difference to them who won.  The institutions of the government will keep chugging along towards collapse either way.  I voted Clinton because I do have an economic reason for doing so, even if it's a desperate one.  I still think she was a horrid candidate and a horrible person.  What I didn't expect was the level of delusion among Democratic Party insiders about what went wrong.  I'm sure now the lesson the Party is taking from this is to blame and shame poor whites, and do the exact same thing they did in 2016 next time.  The higher-ups in the party don't want to admit that they were wrong about anything.  It's madness.	radarerror30	t3_68nj0e

t3_68hpxv	t1_dh0ala2	1493683035	Yeah dude, I'm one of them, and couldn't agree more with you in that department.  However, the core problem of illegals being given free reign to integrate into society with zero repercussions still remains because you didn't actually tell me what you seem to think the problem is.. if not the agents of ICE, then what? People living here for years illegally is not core to the conversation of "what is the problem?". It's simply a side effect of the core problem.   I'm also not sure what you mean by "people like you" but I know that if I had said anything even close to that I would be called out for it and this convo would go in a completely different direction... Not all white people are rich assholes. We don't all exclude and shun people who aren't just like us out of pure, unjustifiable resentment. That's what "people like you" do.   With that said, deportation of anyone without documentation would send a pretty clear message that we refuse to tolerate illegal immigration. It would open up a ton of jobs, regardless of how desirable they may or may not be, that us law abiding "working class" folks have been needing for some time. It would ease the strain on law enforcement to track illegals, since they don't have social security #s or a drivers license, freeing them up to focus effort on more relevant problems.   What would they do when they got home? Reintegrate into society like their parents did!

Rural Minnesotans are the most passive-aggressive and outwardly prejudiced people I have ever met. And I've lived in an array of bumfuck, middle of nowhere, hyper religious places in my years.  Urban Minnesotans are pretty cool though, as are rural Minnesotans with parents born about the mid-50s. Sadly, the children of folks just older or just younger than that got the parents that were born racist and the parents that learned to be racist because of *their* parents, respectively. And now the people about 32-40 are prejudiced, and popping out more racists because they're super religious. They missed out on the parents that lived through the Civil Rights movement and saw how terrible racism is. Unfortunately, this trend is not something I've noticed exclusively in Minnesota. It's everywhere.	B_Fee	t1_dh0cldn

Your middle east mucking didn't help, China's steadily growing didn't help. Ever wonder why Obama called for a pivot to the Pacific?  He saw what was happening. But In fact the only reason US still has a presence in the Pacific is because of economics and 7th fleet. But China is still rising economic partner and they already have a lot of countries in their pocket. Then even Hilary was having second thoughts about TPP.  Duterte was part of that last straw while still under Obama. He's unsavory but his reasons for kissing up to China is not new to previous Philippine administrations.

That would have helped our relationship with those countries for sure, one of the reasons it was negotiated in the first place, maybe?

t3_68ma96	t1_dh0q7gy	1493705114	Were you aware that Duterte didn't like the Obama administration? Especially since it was his admin that was vocal about human rights. It was during that time Duterte decided to pivot more to China instead.   The reprimands from Obama admin didn't help because US has always had frosty relations with Duterte since back his days as mayor of a prominent Southern city. If by the norm, you mean Anti-American? No. He didn't actually run on anti-US platform although he was already known for being critical of US by those familiar with him except the electorate at large.	lilyrach	t1_dh0p762
t3_68ma96	t1_dh0qm02	1493706073	Of course I was aware he didn't like obama, but how does that mean that the US is losing Asia? but I guess I was just wondering if this is more of anomaly or if it's how the Philippines really feel about the United States.   I'm sure they don't enjoy the drug purge going on over there. Reprimanded for human rights violations? Maybe that's why duterte hates obama so much. But in the void that the US is leaving under this admin, china is filling in. That's the point I was trying to make. It's definitely worse because of trump. Even though he probably assumed it would be better because he's the opposite of obama or that he admires the leadership qualities. it would be partisan to say it wasn't or that Hillary would have been just as bad for US Asia relations.	sfgiantsfan650	t1_dh0q7gy

Problem is, that campaign promise was to kill ten thousand criminals.   Personally, I think he really believes in what he does and that it is what the country needs right now.

t3_68wsiu	t1_dh1y5qh	1493770967	Here's my two cents on this, even though nobody really cares.  I am a republican.  I am not a climate denier, but I am a skeptic.  I am not a scientist, so I defer to the experts who are.  That being said, I think the US should exit the Paris climate pact.  Here is why.  As I understand it, the world is warming, and according to scientists consensus, we humans are responsible for the increased rate of climate change.  While I do not see viable solutions being presented, by anyone, that will reverse global warming, I do see people talking about transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy replacements.  More than anything else, I read about people that are adamant about moving away from fossil fuels, right now.    The problem that I have with the Paris accord is this:  The earth, as far as I can tell, does not allow for certain amounts of pollution from each and every nation.  The pollution that we create is not our own special allotment.  There is one planet, and everyone that pollutes, contributes to that pollution.  Therefore, if one person is meant to stop using fossil fuels, everyone must.  I do not care about who did what to whom, or who got industrialized first, or whatever.  None of that matters from a pollution standpoint, because I do not think the earth is going to say "ok India, ok China, you two can go on polluting now, its fine.... you didnt get to pollute way back when, so your allotment of pollution is still there for you to use."    If one person has to abandon fossil fuels, everyone does.  No more planes, no more cars, no more coal, no more....  besides what that would do to the worlds' economy (which nobody seems to care about),  it is fair.  Anyone who says fossil fuels are bad, but India and China can keep on polluting because 'reasons'...... is just laughable.	Breesusmvp	t3_68wsiu
t3_68wsiu	t1_dh1y9lp	1493771095	&gt;but I am a skeptic  No. You aren't. Skeptics have their minds changed by evidence. If you are "skeptical" of climate science at this point, you're either a liar, a moron, or both.	justanyman1	t1_dh1y5qh
t3_68wsiu	t1_dh1yh82	1493771348	Different countries can reduce their emissions at different rates. Obviously, to completely eliminate emissions would be impossible but we can do a hell of a lot to reduce them.  The US is the richest nation on Earth: It is much easier for us to make those investments than poorer nations.	Mr_Buckets_	t1_dh1y5qh
t3_68wsiu	t1_dh1yipo	1493771396	You can't be a climate change "skeptic." You either accept facts or you deny them. Attitudes like yours, people who think they are smarter than the entire scientific community, will doom this planet and future generations.	GreatZoombini	t1_dh1y5qh
t3_68wsiu	t1_dh1ylla	1493771492	China is making a massive push forward with renewables and scaling back their plans for coal, while India just proposed replacing all fossil fueled cars with electrics by 2030. We're talking about rolling back every regulation possible and backing out of important agreements like this. Hell, Trump's trying to revive the coal industry in a country where the remaining supply is less competitive to go after than the cost of renewables.   Surely you'd have heard this stuff if you were interested in the topic, but it sounds more like you're worried it might not be worth it to save the planet if it burdens us more than others, nevermind our consumption definitely justifies our doing something to curb our emissions.	zherok	t1_dh1y5qh
t3_68wsiu	t1_dh1ynqk	1493771564	Both [China](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/alvin-lin/chinas-new-plans-deepen-action-climate-change) and [India](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/02/india-pledges-40-percent-electricity-renewables-2030) have been working to reduce the harm they do for a while now. I can't speak to how effective their efforts have been, but suggesting they are just carrying on as they were just isn't true.  The rest of your argument suggests that just because one kid is pissing in the pool, we should all piss in the pool. Five people that throw bags of trash on the highway is a problem, and we should put pressure on people to stop doing that. If everyone looked at them and said "well, they do it, so I should too", we wouldn't have anywhere to put our cars.  If you accept that the climate is warming, and the scientists' assessment regarding who is responsible (humans) -- as you have stated above -- then you are not a skeptic, as you have just described your understanding of the matter.  Further, just because there isn't a solution that reverses the issue *now*, doesn't mean that there won't be in the future, nor does it mean that we can't reduce the speed at which we induce it. In fact, not reducing the speed, decreases the time we have to find a way to reverse it.	----root	t1_dh1y5qh

t3_68wsiu	t1_dh1zk66	1493772653	I get where you are coming from, but you're missing the big picture here.  The first being that the US, as the largest industrialized nation, has far and away been the primary contributor to climate change. The problem you're describing has long been debated by economists, but there is some consensus that it is fair for the polluter to pay for their pollution. We can't specifically tell which carbon molecules in the atmosphere came from the US, but we do have a decent estimate of how many did. That share is our responsibility according to your logic.  Secondly, the Paris Clmate Accord does not ask to eliminate all forms of fossil fuel, only a reduction. What we are talking about isn't no cars, no planes, no factories. We are talking about cleaner and more cars, planes, and factories as technology allows.   Thirdly, the stakes here are the existence of life on this planet. It is possible that millions, perhaps billions of people will die or become refugees if the climate is allowed passed a tipping point. We don't know exactly when that tipping point is, but most scientists agree it will probably happen before 2100 if nothing is changed. I understand why you want everyone to pay their fair share, but until there is a global consensus, the alternative to self-sacrifice may be mass death and a refugee crisis way worse than what we have now.  And lastly, you claim that you see a lot of people asking for more renewables, but nobody proposing solutions. I don't know if you don't know much about renewables, or just disagree on the facts, but renewable energy is absolutley a solution to climate change. The planet *can* handle a certain amount of carbon emissions per year, but just not what we are doing right now. If we got even most of our power and electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and nuclear, we would be able to not only stop but also reverse climate change.	Kvetch__22	t1_dh1y5qh

t3_68xh1j	t1_dh22xl2	1493776832	Republicans can't tell the difference between racist humor and *racial* humor.  You shouldn't be surprised that they can't tell the difference in this case either.	cannonfunk	t1_dh22vgq
t3_68xh1j	t1_dh2318k	1493776955	How much of this is disingenuous outrage from rightists who don't otherwise care about opposing homophobia?  The criticism I've seen from the left is along the lines of "Trump and Putin are ridiculous hetero-macho types, so make fun of that."   I'm not a fan of 2000's-style "the punchline is that he's gay!" jokes, because it just seems lazy.	TheDaggestOfNabbits	t3_68xh1j
t3_68xh1j	t1_dh236ii	1493777135	You sure about that? I know a certain conservative that said a bunch of racist stuff, sexist stuff and bragged about sexually assaulting women - and they made that guy president.	AnneSullivan2020	t1_dh22oh8
t3_68xh1j	t1_dh2380s	1493777189	The punchline isn't that he's gay. The punchline is that he's in a subservient position to Putin.  If anything, the joke is problematic because it isnt sex positive.	GrumpyBearBank	t1_dh2318k
t3_68xdr7	t1_dh23928	1493777225	It's really obvious why they're at such an impasse.   They've choked their constituents on "NO OBAMACARE" for 7 years.  Over and over and over again.   So they've created a want - cancelling Obamacare - but their constituents *also* want shit to get *better* for them.   And they are at least wise enough at this point to know that *losing* Obamacare in exchange for the shit-burger that the GOP has drafted will make life *worse* for them, because the GOP bill is obviously and plainly only good for super rich people.   So know they've actually compounded their problem.  Their constituents want Obamacare *repealed* and their life and health to *improve*.  Well, right now these two are essentially antithetical and mutually exclusive.   So the GOP literally can't win.  If they leave Obamacare in place, they're failures.  If the repeal it, they kills their constituents, and have a revolt in the wake of the resulting bloodbath.    Their only solution would be to replace Obamacare with a *much better alternative* - but the only *better* healthcare alternative are *socialized medicine*, which, if they endorse, will again make them look like liars and frauds.	ninemiletree	t3_68xdr7

t3_68xdr7	t1_dh23dlr	1493777385	The revealing thing about the struggle to get this vote through is that House GOP members *know* that this bill would die in the Senate. They *know* it would never become law. Yet they've burned through so much political capital with their constituents that they won't even risk the *appearance* of sincerity for the bill's policies. They know they're on 'last straw' status with so many of their constituents which means that growing frustration about conservative representation has eclipsed anti-Liberal fervor.	PhyterNL	t3_68xdr7

t3_68xh1j	t1_dh23vcb	1493777996	It might not be by the letter homophobic , but you can make a case that it is tone deaf. By saying Trump's mouth is a cock holster for Putin. It's implying that someone who sucks dick is less of a man, you could even say it implies it makes you a woman which is tone deaf there too.  However before people try to defend him. I don't think that was Colbert's intention. And it really was just a jab at Trump and Putin the latter of which has serious issues with gay sex.  If I was Colbert here is how I would explain it. I don't find anything wrong with guys giving each other blowjobs, but Trump and Putin do find something wrong with, and that's why it's the perfect insult for them.	agentup	t1_dh22rs4

t3_68xdr7	t1_dh2430p	1493778261	I agree that Dems won't scale back the ACA. They shouldn't. But they would probably agree to some improvements.   Also, Moderate Republicans worked with Democrats rather than the freedom caucus for the budget deal. So not completely unprecedented.	JustGotOffOfTheTrain	t1_dh23hag
t3_68xdr7	t1_dh243vo	1493778290	Right.  See that would still be a loss for them.  Fixing Obamacare (amending and improving it, rather) is proof that *it was a good idea to start*.    They're all legislators.  They know what a tremendous achievement passing the ACA was in the first place, and what a nighmarish mountain it would be to do anything that approximates it.   Thus, they're fucked.	ninemiletree	t1_dh23bbm

t3_68xdr7	t1_dh25k4k	1493780095	They would never be able to spin it like that, and they know it.  For one, Democrats would *never* let them live down the fact that *Republicans* were working on *Obamacare* because they underlying legislation is rock-solid.   For two, they're tied by their own simplistic rhetoric.  They *promised* and *vowed* to REPEAL Obamacare.  Not fix it, tweak it, or compromise it.

t3_68xh1j	t1_dh25t4e	1493780387	Ok, well it still isn't homophobic. The joke about someone sucking a dick isn't sexuality based.. The joke isn't that they're homophobic and that's bad, but that Trump is submissive to Putin.  Or it's ironic because Putin and Trump are acting like stereotypical macho heterosexual men. Either way, not homophobic.	MarduRusher	t1_dh25ntu
t3_68xh1j	t1_dh25y9m	1493780552	Not in the slightest. This has nothing to do with femininity, at least in my point of view. More of a dominant/submissive type thing.	TheSorge	t1_dh25ky5
t3_68xdr7	t1_dh262nx	1493780700	They can't scale it back.  Obamacare was literally the least they could do.  Take anything away it it collapses.  That's the core problem the Republicans face.

There are no acceptable levels pollution.  I mean, isnt that the point?  If humans are responsible for the rate of climate change, then shouldnt humans stop polluting, period?  If we are saying that some pollution is ok, then who gets to say which country gets to pollute, and how much?    I dont care about which country is rich or poor, or who started polluting, and I dont think the planet cares either.  If the science is settled, then there is no room for negotiating who gets to do what... everything has to stop.  Or am I missing something?  Is there a board that gets to set the levels of acceptable polluting?  Is there a meter somewhere that says how much pollution the earth can handle per year?  Do we all get quotas?    One thing is for certain, any country that adopts climate friendly measures is going to fuck their economy up, bad.  I do not think it wise or prudent for the United States government to just trash our economy, when others dont plan to fuck theirs up until 2030.  Remember that we are competing with these countries on a daily basis.	Breesusmvp	t1_dh29dgi

t3_68ydda	t1_dh2b29q	1493788327	I'm right in every way, and in the future I'd suggest you not comment on subjects like this when you aren't clear on the facts.  https://warontherocks.com/2016/07/why-intent-not-gross-negligence-is-the-standard-in-clinton-case/  &gt;&gt; Justice Stanley Reed wrote the majority opinion and disagreed that the law was unconstitutionally vague, but only on the very narrow grounds that the law required “intent or reason to believe that the information to be obtained is to be used to the injury of the United States.”  Only because the court read the law to require scienter, or bad faith, before a conviction could be sustained was the law constitutional.  Otherwise, it would be too difficult for a defendant to know when exactly material related to the national defense.  The court made clear that if the law criminalized the simple mishandling of classified information, it would not survive constitutional scrutiny, writing:  &gt;&gt; The sections are not simple prohibitions against obtaining or delivering to foreign powers information… relating to national defense. If this were the language, it would need to be tested by the inquiry as to whether it had double meaning or forced anyone, at his peril, to speculate as to whether certain actions violated the statute.  &gt;&gt; In other words, the defendant had to intend for his conduct to benefit a foreign power for his actions to violate 793(f).  &gt;&gt; Without the requirement of intent, the phrase “relating to the national defense” would be unconstitutionally vague.  This reading of the statute has guided federal prosecutors ever since, which is why Comey based his decision not to file charges on Clinton’s lack of intent.  **This is also why no one has ever been convicted of violating 793(f) on a gross negligence theory.**  &gt;&gt; **Only one person has even been charged under a gross negligence theory: FBI Agent James Smith.  Smith carried on a 20-year affair with a Chinese national who was suspected of spying for Beijing, and Smith would bring classified material to their trysts, behavior far more reckless than anything Clinton is accused of.  But Smith was not convicted of violating 793(f).  He struck a plea agreement that resulted in a conviction to the lesser charge of lying to federal agents.  Smith was sentenced to three months of home confinement and served no jail time.**  &gt;&gt; **Members of the U.S. military have been charged with the negligent mishandling of classified material, but not under 793(f).  Criminal charges in military court are brought under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, not the Espionage Act (although violations of the Espionage Act can be charged under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in military court).  The military has extensive regulations that govern the handling of classified material and the failure to follow these regulations is a criminal offense.  Negligence can result in a conviction under Article 92 because the test is whether the service member “knew or should have known” they were violating the regulation. But these rules do not apply to any civilian personnel at the State Department and can only be applied to DoD civilians in very limited circumstances.**  &gt;&gt; **Despite what may appear to be the plain meaning of 793(f), the negligent mishandling of classified material is not a civilian criminal offense.  A civilian can face many consequences for negligently mishandling classified material, including the loss of their clearance and probably with it their employment, but they would not face criminal charges.  For anyone who thinks negligence should be a crime their argument is not with Director Comey but with Justice Reed, the author of the Gorin opinion. Because of that decision, the correct standard is intent, not gross negligence, and the director was right not to recommend a criminal case.**	pizzashill	t1_dh2b02a

The core philosophy (ostensibly) for Republicans:  - reduce wasteful government spending to a minimum   - do whatever you can to simplify government and reduce needless redundancy.  - support regulations only, and I do mean ONLY IF those regulations do not result in a severe reduction of personal liberty.  We can compare developed countries, their healthcare policies, spending, and outcomes.  It is an undeniable, absolutely established fact that the United States spends more on healthcare per capita, has countless redundant forms of government funded healthcare, onerous regulations, and a high tax burden which negatively impacts individuals and businesses.  A single-payer system aligns perfectly with conservative talking points, here is a taste:  "We simplified healthcare by eliminating subsidies and Medicaid. We repealed and replaced "Obamacare." We lifted the burden of health insurance costs for big and small businesses alike, and reduced costs by negotiating for lower prices on services and prescription drugs. American families will now have more of their own money to spend, which will stimulate the economy. We will have the healthiest workforce in the world while also reducing labor costs, making American workers more competitive, and this will bring back jobs in manufacturing. We did all of this, while also cutting taxes. Single payer healthcare was something democrats *talked* about, but in eight years they couldn't figure out how to do it. They couldn't deliver, but the GOP accomplished that and so much more. We call it "The Healthy American Familes Act of 2017.""	idioma	t3_68yorg

She seems like a good mother and I kind of like that she is just staying away from anything political, doing first lady stuff.

t3_68yq5a	t1_dh2efox	1493796018	My theory is that she probably was a high end escort. Her relationship with Trump was purely because he paid her. They had a deal she would be his trophy wife, he would pay her money, and she'd get US citizenship. Later I read he didn't want a kid but he made a deal with her for one kid if she agreed to stay thin post pregnancy. So I doubt they ever had a real relationship, it was just business. Now he is POTUS and the BS drives her crazy and Trump is probably even more mentally deranged than he was a year ago. She probably is like screw this crap. We had a deal, it never included this.	deporttrumptosyria	t3_68yq5a

Looking at their behavior rather than their words, it seems plain to me that the single motivating factor that drives nearly every major Republican politician is the desire to do absolutely anything to stay in power.

Moreover, if you're really worried about those moochers taking from you, you'd best be served encouraging healthcare for all, so that more preventive care got taken, rather than a healthcare system so expensive that people avoid seeking out medical attention until it's truly dire. You still get to pay for it in the end, it just costs everyone more on a longer time scale and society as a whole loses out on productivity.  There's a point where it's not even about money anymore, it's literally working against them to allow so many fellow citizens to be sick and unhealthy, but denying them coverage gives the richest a short-term money boost and apparently the warm fuzzies knowing they get theirs and the rest of us can fuck off.	zherok	t1_dh2djsp

t3_68yorg	t1_dh2gnb9	1493802695	The problem with the individual mandate is it doesn't work well some insurance markets like Alaska.  Let me get into why.  I'm lucky to have premium-free insurance through a spouse's awesome workplace.  I've also been lucky in the past to have $200/month coverage.  Either of those is incredibly cheap for this state.  Most people here are covered through a) an employer, spouse's employer, or parent's employer, b) Indian Health Service, c) Medicaid, or d) Medicare.  The people that aren't covered are really fucked because Alaska's individual market is so small it's &lt;25,000 people for the whole state.  Those people tend to be sick due to the above.  Premiums are through the roof - to the tune of ~$20,000 annually for a family on the individual market.  Since Alaskans have higher incomes due to our high COL it's pretty easy for a couple with two working (but freelance) professionals or for a professional fisherman not to qualify for any subsidies.    In general though people in my state pay among the highest premiums on both the individual AND the group markets.  We've got a ton of uninsured people - 13% (the third highest uninsured rate in the US).  You can mandate people get insurance, but they'll still risk going without because the costs are so high.

I wouldn't believe him if he was telling me about the hole-in-one he shot while high fiving Tom Brady, but if he says that he's going to react strongly against nuclear provocation from North Korea or that he'll work his hardest to clean up Washington and get deals done then I do believe him.

t3_6908xx	t1_dh2nx8r	1493818313	Well considering we already have evidence that the latter two claims are not true -- considering his tough talk was proven to be bluster after North Korea went ahead with their tests anyway with no response and now he's talking about how Kim Jong-un is a good guy and he'd like to meet him, and considering his cabinet is full of the very same kind of "crooks" he promised to get rid of along with a couple of neo-Nazis on top of that (Bannon alone probably dirties up Washington beyond any "swamp" on a purely physical level) -- I'd say you'd have to be pretty gullible to still believe that, and ignorant too.

Is he going to crack down on China for being a "currency manipulator?"  As to North Korea, I have seen zero sign that he is even remotely capable of understanding the complicated nature of the South Korea-North Korea-China-Japan relations in the area.  If his recent lecture about Andrew Jackson is indicative of his intellectual capacity (and given its similarities to everything else he's said) then we're all screwed in the North Korea situation spirals out of control.

t3_6908xx	t1_dh2ocln	1493818893	North Korea has not tested a nuclear weapon since Trump has been president. Ballistic missile tests, yes - but their last nuclear weapon test was September 9th, 2016. Those tests were met with strongly worded statements, and increased pressure on China to reign in North Korea through stricter economic sanctions. If they test a nuclear weapon, you can be very sure there will be a response from the United States.   I'm fine with Trump calling Kim Jong-Un a "smart cookie", and saying that if the circumstances were right he would meet him face to face.  I don't believe he's ever said he's a good guy.    I don't know what you mean by "crooks", Trump campaigned around draining the swamp of the political establishment &amp; elite, of which there are very few members - DeVos and Chao are the only ones that really spring to mind.    Be careful wielding your opinions as absolute truths.	JamisonP	t1_dh2nx8r

t3_6908xx	t1_dh2ot0t	1493819490	Yes, from my point of view he is cleaning up Washington. Not to the extent I would like to see, but we had and still have an issue with career politicians who obtain lofty positions in the government and then stop innovating and improving the system because it works for them and their positions are preordained. There's more to do, but Rome wasn't built in a day and the swamp won't be drained in the first year.   I doubt he's going to crack down on China for being a currency manipulator unless they start posturing against us. They've been reducing their currency manipulation for a year or two now, so it's not even as applicable a label as it was on the campaign trail - and they're also helping us with North Korea.    He appears to understand the complicated nature of SK-NK-Japan-China just fine, because all of a sudden you have China increasing economic sanctions on North Korea, and Japan stepping up offering to lead the diplomatic efforts. There has been a noticeable change in behavior by all countries involved, even the SK presidential candidates are now far more hawkish about NK than they were only months ago. The USA is building a coalition of countries against NK, and by all reports they are succeeding. That is progress &amp; a welcome departure of the past decade's standard of US policy, no matter how you look at it.   I'm curious what you think his recent lecture on Andrew Jackson says about his intellectual capacity. Poor articulation aside, cursory research into Andrew Jackson pretty much validates all of what Trump said. It's actually pretty entertaining to watch historians engage in knowing intellectual dishonesty to try and rebut Trump's personal opinion about Andrew Jackson.	JamisonP	t1_dh2o0vr
t3_6908xx	t1_dh2oyye	1493819708	Gee, I wonder what those missile tests were for? Fun? Part of their volleyball games? Couldn't be building up to anything else right? Point is, Trump tells them not to do anything, not even those tests, acts like he's gonna get all tough at the first sign of trouble, but doesn't. The man is nothing but bluster. Oooh "strongly worded statements," so tough. But it's for the best, because if he actually DID follow through with his threats then, almost assuredly, millions would die in South Korea. A dangerously unstable lunatic who has public meltdowns on Twitter is at the wheel in the most delicate of situations. That you are OK with this is baffling. That you believe anything said by this pathological liar and con artist is even more baffling.  Calling Kim Jong-un smart, sympathizing with him because "poor dictator had a big responsibility after his dad died and had to kill his uncle to maintain power" is just another sign of Trump's disturbing admiration for dictators. That he did not literally call him a "good guy" is irrelevant, I didn't say he literally did, speaking of him in a positive light at all is deranged. And something tells me if Obama had been willing to meet with him, you would not have had the same response.  Trump's cabinet is the richest in history. It is full to the brim with Goldman Sachs members and others with Wall Street connections (Mnuchin) despite Trump criticizing Hillary for even giving speeches to them, and when he's not hypocritically and transparently giving jobs to his wealthy elite friends, he's hiring dangerously unqualified fascists like Bannon, who as I said are far worse than the worst of the "swamp."  Don't you fucking dare speak to me of truths when you're defending the president of "alternative facts."	PresidentFDR	t1_dh2ocln
t3_6908xx	t1_dh2paj3	1493820118	Sometimes to counter a crazy two bit dictator, you need to act a little crazy and unpredictable yourself. If war breaks out that will be awful, but within 4 years North Korea will have developed a nuclear weapon capable of striking the US mainland and that is unacceptable to global security. It can't, and won't happen. Obama should never have let it get this far, but it is what it is and we have to deal with it now.   Trump can call Kim Jong-Un all the nice names he wants. We need to bring these crazy dictators within our sphere of influence, if he schmoozes with people like Duterte and Un and that makes them more amenable to coming to the negotiating table and finding a diplomatic solution that's great. The world superpower acting aggressive will only force those types of leaders to galvanize their support in US opposition, and a cornered dog always bites.    Trump's cabinet is indeed the richest in modern history, but I would point you your attention to Dwight Eisenhower's administration for comparison. It was called 8 millionaires and a plumber, because it was made up of captains of industry and the economic elite. It was also one of the most successful administrations in US history. Food for thought.	JamisonP	t1_dh2oyye

t3_6908xx	t1_dh2q04s	1493821008	&gt;Sometimes to counter a crazy two bit dictator, you need to act a little crazy and unpredictable yourself.  This might be the most ridiculous and disturbing sentence I have read on this site, no small feat. You really will stop at nothing to defend this lunatic will you? You basically admit that he's crazy but seem to think it's part of some ingenious "4D chess" scheme against all evidence to the contrary.  Look, I can tell you're not a complete idiot. The fact that you can write complete sentences already tells me you're smarter than the guy who can't even spell "tap." But you're really doing some exceptional mental gymnastics here. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, and sometimes a narcissistic orange manchild is just a narcissistic orange manchild.  And no, using a crazy dictator to fight a crazy dictator does not work. That just leads to fucking WW3, when TWO (or more) egotistical manchildren start firing nukes at each other.  Also, I'm confused: Should we be acting aggressive toward Kim Jong-un and other dictators or "schmoozing" with them? You contradicted yourself within sentences. Oh, I get it. Whatever Dear Leader says or does in the moment goes. When he pivots I pivot, and I'll use my mental gymnastics to justify it, logical consistency be damned. Also how is this Obama's fault again? North Korea has been a complex problem for every president since... Eisenhower.  Which brings me to your next fallacy: I never said that having elites in the cabinet is bad in and of itself. I was simply pointing out that you were incorrect in your assertion that his cabinet wasn't full of elites (something you apparently willfully lied about - or maybe it was just an "alternative fact") and calling out his hypocrisy.  Plus, don't compare Trump to Eisenhower please. Eisenhower was a real man and a hero who served the country this orangutan has been taking advantage of while giving nothing back to it his whole life. Eisenhower also may have had a wealthy cabinet, but he largely used it to help the people. Here's a quote of his I particularly like that happens to perfectly describe the GOP today:  &gt;Should any political party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes that you can do these things. Among them are a few Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or businessman from other areas. Their number is negligible and they are stupid.	PresidentFDR	t1_dh2paj3

t3_6908xx	t1_dh2qehf	1493821488	Heh, I'd by lying if I said defending Trump didn't involve some mental gymnastics sometimes. But, I don't find myself ever really contradicting my past platform very much, and I reserve the right to evolve on issues. I also usually start with the default position of support the US president, whoever it is - just the type of person I am. Supported Bush, supported Obama, would have supported Hillary - so I'm also going to go to bat for the President when I think they're being unfairly maligned. Which Trump constantly is. And one thing I've learned over the past decade, is that basically everyone is a hypocrite when it comes to politics. Democrats, Republicans, everyone.    Foreign Policy is the one area I'm actually happy with the Trump administration. I like his style of bluster, I think global leaders will respond to it. Obama was too predictable, too polished, and too afraid of breaking political norms. He was easy to anticipate and counter. I really like Rex Tillerson, James Mattis, and Nikki Haley. I think they work well together, and send the appropriate messages in the appropriate manner for their respective roles.   But yes. It's confusing. Act aggressive, but extend your hand. It's impressive that Trump can promise military action in the same breath as saying Kim Jong Un is a smart guy and understands the position he isn't easy and why he's motivated to posture as he does. We'll see how it plays out, but i'm cautiously optimistic North Korea's nuclear program will be eradicated one way or another by the end of his first term. Hopefully not war, but if it is - so be it.

t3_6908xx	t1_dh2rsiu	1493823105	I personally find that very alien and disturbing, that authoritarian mindset of "support the leader no matter what." It's unfortunately all too common in this country, but it runs counter to the entire spirit it was founded upon.  There is nothing "unfair" about the maligning of Trump. He has debased this country, perhaps irreparably. We elected an admitted sexual predator, a con man who gets into petty feuds with fellow B-list celebrities on Twitter. It's still unreal to me. He deserves absolutely no respect, not even the usual respect afforded to the office, because he has lowered that office simply by virtue of being in it.  And no, I don't think everybody in politics is equally a hypocrite, and I detest all forms of mental gymnastics. Are you sure you're not Kellyanne Conway? In a similar vein, I do not consider being "confusing" and "unpredictable" an "impressive" strategy. It is one of many signs of a chaotic, disorganized, disunited administration helmed by someone who has no clue what he is doing.  And callously saying "so be it" to the potential deaths of millions is beyond terrifying. The fact that the man you defend likely feels the same way is even more chilling.	PresidentFDR	t1_dh2qehf

t3_6908xx	t1_dh2v0ta	1493826673	A poorly articulated argument *is* a bad argument. It represents the worst of Trumpian logic; he argues something incredibly vague with no supporting logic, and all his supports fill that gap with what they *want* him to have said.  Anyway, you think Jackson had a big heart?  Lol.  Ask the thousands of Cherokee that died after getting kicked out of Florida.  Jackson did do a decent job of handling the Nullification Crisis, but Trump has shown zero evidence that he even *knows* what the Nullification Crisis was about.  His handling of the crisis did involve things like ignoring the Supreme Court, though, which certainly was playing with fire.  Also, the scale of the of the Nullification Crisis was essentially limited to S Carolina, and not the whole of the south as Lincoln would be facing almost 3 decades later.  To say that since Jackson just decided to not have a civil war is simply fiction.  His methods (ie, threatening to kill a sitting senator) may simply have further inflamed tensions in the 1860s.  So in addition to being incredibly poorly articulated (and actually completely missing anything that backs up his opinion), his arguments are incredibly simplistic too.	Rower78	t1_dh2ot0t

t3_6908xx	t1_dh2x2m2	1493828879	It sounds like you're engaging in a bit of the "worst of Trumpian logic" yourself. Taking a vague statement and filling in the gaps with the supporting evidence that you *want* him to have said to confirm your narrative against him. I'll engage in the same process, and fill the gaps with my own supporting evidence which lead me to believe Trump's point isn't as reductive or simplistic as you choose to believe.    I have no opinion on the size of Andrew Jacksons heart. Trump could have been referring to two things - either referencing his wife's death after a brutal campaign where her character was assaulted, and her sudden death he attributed to the campaign and carried the sadness with him - visiting her grave every day. He was indeed a man of profound anger and sadness.    The other, is that many presidential historians do indeed say he was [more gentle](http://www.npr.org/2017/05/01/526388034/fact-check-could-andrew-jackson-have-stopped-the-civil-war-as-trump-said) than his reputation tells the story of.  &gt;So did he have a "big heart"? Some of his biographers think so. He was said to be a gentle master; there were scenes of slaves crying when he died; and one writer even called him "an ideal slave owner." However, he was never so kind to his slaves as to free them.   &gt;Jackson behaved similarly toward Indians: making friends with them, but never stopping his efforts to obtain their land for the United States. Maybe it's best to say that Jackson had a "big heart," except where his economic or political interests were at stake.    Sure. He was a slave owner, as many wealthy southerners were - and he certainly acted ruthless and terrible against the Cherokees during the Trail of Tears. But Trump is not the first person to claim Andrew Jackson had a big heart, and Trump does seem well versed in Andrew Jackson's biography so it's not surprising he would reference AJ's big heart as a comparison to himself, as he often speaks of himself as having a lot of heart and compassion.    I'm glad you're familiar with the nullification crisis. Yes, he ignored the SCOTUS decision - quite a scary precedent. But, historians point towards the SC Succession bid in 1832 as a precursor to the civil war. Andrew Jackson successfully ended that bid, he was a very large and imposing figure in the political landscape. He was dedicated to preserving &amp; expanding the union, and he was not afraid to face down his own countrymen with the threat of absolute destruction to preserve it. His reputation, especially in the south, was dominating. Who can say what would have happened if Andrew Jackson was still alive &amp; relevant in 1861, but it's certainly an opinion one can have that Andrew Jackson would have come out strongly for the union and his presence on the other side would have affected the calculus of the southern states decision to secede.     So, he may have inflamed tensions, he might have averted the civil war, but in doing so also preserved slavery. Who can say. We have no idea what could and would of happened, but it isn't fiction to have an opinion over what *might* have happened. Presidents generally look towards past presidents for inspiration, Donald Trump clearly has an affinity for Andrew Jackson. That's fine, there hasn't yet been a definitive list of which previous Presidents are acceptable to admire and which are not.	JamisonP	t1_dh2v0ta

And by virtue of their hatreds, her haters will oppose her and mock her even if she's saying the right things.  Eventually, they will expose themselves.    Just like what Barrack Obama did.

When Romney lost in 2012, they dropped him like a bad habit. Its not like he was a bad Republican, but they realized that he lost and that is that. Time to realize what we did wrong and try to regroup with someone new.  Lets take house leadership on the Republican Side.

t3_68yz9h	t1_dh2xwej	1493829764	American here. High school was a waste of time, taught me a whitewashed version of history that im reteaching myself and gave me absolutely zero preparation for being an adult and entering the work force. Its only now, at 28, that im realizing just how underprepared and ill informed high school made me. Im realizing how fucked up it is that we are taught to believe in our racist, slave owning founding fathers and believe that american white history has been about freeing the world and the slaves. Really, white american history is really nothing to be particularly proud of. We enslaved the competition so we could be the ones who made discoveries and inventions. And every time our ruling class gave the new immigrants rights, it was on the basis that at least they were white and deserved better. We white people should be doing everything we can to make up for the many generations of slavery and genocide. And thats exactly why I wasnt taught to think about these things.  Now that my eyes are open, I dont want to live in America anymore. I don't even believe my country is worth fighting for. If there were a civil war or some other revolutionary battle, i will just leave. Im not proud to defend this country or whatever bullshit it claims to stand for.  I dont want to raise my children here. Life is isolating and people are willfully ignorant. Fuck the transportation system here. Its inefficient, stressful and very expensive. Health insurance is fucked. College is fucked.  I can't think of anything in America that isnt fucked. When i talk about it with americans, the responses from people whose family came from third world countries tell me that im privileged and that there are many worse places i could have been born.  But im struggling so hard to work the system in my favor. Somehow, theres always someone better than me applying for the same job. I will be forced to move out of home soon and get ANY job i can to scrape by. I went to college to better myself, twice, and i still am shit apparently. Just so happens that many developing countries teach kids computer science from a young age, so when they become adults they can get visas and beat american competition. My last boss (who replaced 3 if us) was not at all shy about his favoratism for foreign workers. They are better than Sr. Engineers and work for 12/hr. I cannot complete with that as a new developer. Id literally be better off by moving to a developing nation and applying for work in the states on a visa.  I dont care about America anymore, i just want leave.	CheeterMcSkeeter	t1_dh2lkw4

They are extremist ideologues who will do whatever it takes to *force* an agenda that most people don't want. They are no better than Islamic fundamentalists.  Public school is an apolitical environment where children learn social norms and *shared values*. This is very important for the stability and progress of society. The extremists don't like that. They want society to turn backwards, and they want rightwing values to be the mainstream.

t3_6908xx	t1_dh2yzfw	1493830921	No, actually, I was going by directly was he said -- here is the verbatim quote  &gt;  I mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn't have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart, and he was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War. He said, "There's no reason for this." People don't realize, you know, the Civil War, you think about it, why?  So Trump *is* saying that Jackson stopped a civil war by decree and that he *would* have stopped the war when it did happen if he had been around.  Why?  Trump never says why his decrees are true.  But the conclusion is simplistic, so that's all we really need to know.    Also, lots and lots of people **do** realize, you know, the Civil War, you think about it, why.  The whole "was slightly nicer to his slaves than were some of his contemporaries , therefore he's a nice guy" argument is pretty week.  You're always going to find southern historians that are willing to give someone moral credit for that, though.  Which historian are you referring too?  Shelby Foote?  The Trail of Tears was worse though.  No amount of being nice to individual Native Americans will ever wash that stain out.	Rower78	t1_dh2x2m2

t3_6908xx	t1_dh314gh	1493833164	The quote is preceded by a conversation over Trump's comparison to Andrew Jackson's campaign, and Andrew Jackson's reaction to his wife's death. It's a [minute and a half long conversation](https://twitter.com/SXMPolitics/status/858999704167751680).   Since I type fast, I'll give you a transcript. But I'd urge you listen to the clip rather than read a transcript. Trump is still is inarticulate AF, but his style of communicating does not translate to written text well. It's a lot of give and take, very conversational, and he makes good use of body language.   &gt;**Trump**: They said my campaign is most like, my campaign and win was most like Andrew Jackson with his campaign And I said, 'when was Andrew Jackson?' It was 1828. That's a long time ago. That's Andrew Jackson. And he had a very, very mean and nasty campaign. Because they said this was the meanest and nastiest. And unfortunately it continues.   &gt;**Interviewer**: His wife died.   &gt;**Trump**: His wife died. They destroyed his wife, and she died. And you know, he was a swash buckler. But when his wife died, you know, e visited his wife every day. I visited her grave actually since I was in Tennessee.   &gt;**Interviewer**: Oh right you were in Tennessee.    &gt;**Trump**: And it was Amazing, the people of Tennessee are amazing people. Well, they love Andrew Jackson. They love Andrew Jackson in Tennessee.    &gt;**Interviewer**: He's a fascinating....   &gt;**Trump**: I mean, had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later you wouldn't have had the civil war. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart. and he was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War. He said, "there's no reason for this." People don't realize, you know, the Civil War, you think about it, why? People don't ask that question. But why was there the civil war. Why could that one not have been worked out?    So I have no idea where you get this statement from the above transcript.   &gt;So Trump is saying that Jackson stopped a civil war by decree and that he would have stopped the war when it did happen if he had been around. Why? Trump never says why his decrees are true. But the conclusion is simplistic, so that's all we really need to know.   Trump is saying that if Andrew Jackson had been alive &amp; politically relevant - probably if he was President but perhaps recently out of office - then he would have found a way to avert the civil war. This isn't a decree, it's an opinion of someone who holds Andrew Jackson in high regard. Because someone is President, their opinions do not suddenly become decrees - and certainly not Trump's.   I find his opinion interesting and thought provoking. I'm sure there were better ways to have handled the issue rather than a bloody civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. Trump once claimed he could have averted it, without mentioning Jackson, so clearly he thinks there was room for negotiation that didn't occur.   I also agree with him there isn't as much of a conversation around why the civil war happened. The "historical consensus" as defined by Politico's [chosen group of historians](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/01/trump-civil-war-237854) says that "The broad consensus among historians is that the secession of 11 Southern states, and the resulting war, was driven by slavery and the racial order that slavery represented.". If you read the article you can practically hear the hand wringing from these historians who are uncomfortable that their "historical consensus" isn't being accepted at face value and isn't above scrutiny.    If you visit an article about confederate monuments being taken down, or the confederate flag being discussed, you're guaranteed to be met with vitriol and aggression unless you wholeheartedly embrace the "Civil war was solely about slavery. South were traitorous racists, the north were open minded equality loving patriots" narrative.    No one debates slavery was a central issue, but I think the lead up to the war and the relationship between the North and the South, tariffs &amp; EU trade are topics that have been sorely minimized to push the narrative that "Civil War = Slavery = North good = South racist", when *that* itself is an incredibly simplistic assessment of why the civil war happened, and what the general populace of both citizens of the North &amp; the South thought about slavery / civil rights.    So, as Trump continues to do, he said something that provoked discussion and thought around something that is fine &amp; healthy to discuss. Good for him. Don't know why you're continuing to demonstrate "the worst of Trumpism" and insist that he had no nuanced point, because he MUST be an idiot, because that just is what it is and you're totally right about it.

Or how people who I would assume are pretty intelligent, can be religious. Maybe I'm wrong in feeling this way, but I lose a ton of respect for someone the moment they reveal any seriousness about religion. A lot of my friends were brought up Catholic or some other Christian denomination...but they see it almost as a tradition, not some guiding principle... they're all decent human beings, not perfect, but at least they don't let some archaic viewpoint impact how they view their current reality.

Homosexuality is constitutionally protected and they deserve the same rights as everyone. Judges swear to uphold the constitution. He is in violation of his oath and needs to step down.

t3_68yz9h	t1_dh35a42	1493837578	Unfortunately, the reality is that if you target a group of people and spend centuries disadvantaging them then it ends up taking quite a few generations to rectify. Saying that it happened a long time ago and it isn't your problem to fix is equivalent to saying that it shouldn't be fixed. Enslaving people and then spending a century passing and enforcing laws to economically disadvantage them afterwards is either going to get fixed over the course of generations through our collective societal effort or it's never going to get fixed and racial division will inevitably tear this country apart. There's a direct line between what black people were subjected to and the shitty conditions that a lot of them live in today. It's not something that you can just ignore when it's effects still play a huge role in millions of people's lives every day.  It's not about responsibility for what happened.

t3_692fpi	t1_dh37jbi	1493839955	Yeah he does. That recent spate of articles had him justifying *every decision to violate DoJ protocol* as "If I adhere to protocol, the GOP will call me partisan and claim I wasn't objective".  Every flipping one. That's why he gave an unprecedented press conference on Clinton's server (instead of, you know, just saying the usual "The FBI did not refer charges"). That's why he released the letter. That's why he didn't sign onto the Russian claims, even though the FBI agreed with them.  Each and every time it was "If I do what DoJ policy says, Republicans will claim I'm biased against them".  So he very clearly cares what Republicans think about him -- or at least are willing to say.   (Funny, I read all those articles -- and not one time did Comey seem to care if Democrats called him partisan, biased, or anything like that. Working the refs *works*. Way to go GOP. 30 years of effort paid off big time. The head of the FBI will bend over backwards in your favor so you can't scream "politics" at him).	Morat20	t3_692fpi

t3_692fpi	t1_dh37o00	1493840094	I listened to the entire hearing and this title is misleading.

He said several times how he has worried about how he handled everything, but fully believed he made the right decision (and if Chaffetz hadn't released the letter to the press, it might not be as big of an issue as it is).  Comey is a good man and exemplifies what the head of an organization like the FBI should be like. Unfortunately his agency got used hard for political purposes by both major parties, and they continue to do so.	Amrokmfc	t3_692fpi

Unlike many (most?) in Washington, he doesn't have partisanship dripping off him like someone caught in a spring rain without an umbrella, so I'm inclined to think that's what it looks like when a decent person is brave enough to swim in those waters, tries to do the right thing, and can't help but get tarnished by the dirty brush that is politics.

Those at least make sense as a deterrent to voting.    If people are so uncritical in their thinking that something as minor as "we are looking into this new thing" and "we looked and nothing whatsoever was found" can influence their vote, we are truly fucked as a nation, because that should not be enough.  I've asked myself why elections over the last decade or so have constantly balanced on the edge of a knife.  Statistically that's improbable.  It should never be consistently 50/50 within the range of error (remember the hanging chads?).  Somethings going on that we don't quite understand that is keeping elections tight, because from election to election, things shouldn't be so close, given human nature.  Or, if something as minor as a single report of the status of an investigation can actually tip an election, then we need a better system, because the current one is too fragile.	c0d3g33k	t1_dh3h4oi

How the hell is that anything BUT partisan? He abandoned procedure and best practices to stay in the good graces of a political party.   The only way it could have been more partisan is if he'd worn a MAGA hat while doing it.  Edited to add: I doubt he thought "Oh, I'm gonna throw this to Trump" or "I'm doing the GOP a solid here". But it was still partisan. He abandoned the procedures he was supposed to follow to please a political party.	Morat20	t1_dh3a3vw

t3_693tg3	t1_dh3iptt	1493852643	Generally they often determine biological gender, but many times they also don't: example: a genetically xy baby will develop into a female if it has complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. However, she will have internal testicles in place of uterus and ovaries, but literally everything else about her will be biologically female. Most likely she will find out about the syndrome once she reaches puberty but doesn't get her period.  Saying XY always produces a male is out of date, incredibly simplified, and certainly not always accurate.  Even biological gender is more of a spectrum than previously thought.	shittingorangeturds	t1_dh3iawr

t3_693tg3	t1_dh3jo5w	1493853875	What controls anatomical sex *in utero* is multilayered (as is physical sex itself), and not really about chromosomes *per se*. There are specific genes that are involved such as SRY that are usually on the Y chromosome but can transpose to an X chromosome during meiosis, which can give rise to someone anatomically male but with an XX karyotype.  But even then, what's really controlling anatomical sex on a fundamental level are hormones. You could give an otherwise 'normal' XX fetus testosterone and it would develop anatomically male. Or the effects of hormones could spread partially and/or differentially, which gives rise to intersex conditions (and is the current leading theory to why trans people exist: their brains and bodies get exposed to differing levels of hormones during development).  The free beacon article is probably lying (shocking, I know) and OP is either intentionally or naively spreading their dumb virtue signaling. But even if it really did happen, [it would not really be correct from a scientific standpoint](http://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943) and they would have been correct to pull it (or add a disclaimer/correction). As with many things in biology, reality is far more complicated than the simplistic version we get in high school.	FilteringAccount123	t1_dh3iawr

t3_693tg3	t1_dh3kia9	1493854927	A response to another deleted comment:  Let me spell it out for you:  1. When Bill Nye did that episode, the best science of the day indicated that being biologically male or biologically female was solely caused by chromosomes X and Y. Unusual conditions like androgen insensitivity had not been identified. 2. Science has since updated to incorporate such findings. That is to say, science changes, which is a feature, not a bug. 3. Netflix chose not to include information that was once believed to be accurate, but is now known not to be accurate, in its rebroadcasting of the show. This is appropriate. 4. Free Beacon and other right-wing rags that believe science should never change and the fact that it does is proof of liberal bias or some shit freaked out. Maybe they think nothing ever changes because God or something. 5. You posted here to spread this scientific illiteracy around.

Yes I know he's out of the game, and it  doesn't appear to be payment for favors, but maybe just lay off for awhile until we get this whole unity thing figured out?

t3_69447o	t1_dh3nkyw	1493858702	Well, I have no idea what Obama intends to do with his life long-term post presidency, but it does seem silly to me to expect him, after all he's already done for this country, to continue to live his life according to the whims of the public.  He's not currently holding any office.  I don't care if he earns his money playing a ukelele in his underwear in Times Square.  He's earned the right to have his druthers, at this point.

t3_68yz9h	t1_dh3pdw3	1493860889	You think someone who grows up in a ghetto created by unaddressed segregation policies and who attends a school that is paid for by taxing a people who were denied the opportunity to create generational wealth for 75% of this countries history have the same opportunities as anyone else? Generational wealth is **the** make or break factor in America. The idea that anyone can make it in this country has largely always been bullshit. The truth is that anyone can do decently well, pass that wealth onto their kids, and over generations build wealth. This opportunity was denied a group of people and it shows. Proportionally black people are way less likely to make it into college and they have far fewer family resources to help them when they need it. Crime in black neighborhoods is way higher than white neighborhoods, which is inherent to any impoverished area. Money can't fix that issue. You can't write out a check to undo what happened. It's going to take the better part of half a century of actual effort to honestly be able to say that the effects of discriminating policies have been removed. It's naive to think that we somehow fixed a problem that took hundreds of years to create in just fifty some odd years of spot efforts.  This was the intent of our racially discriminating policies, by the way. For as long as we allow the persistent effects of stumping generational wealth in a group of our population for centuries those policies stand as 100% effective and the people who put them in place got what they wanted. I don't think it's racist to say what you're saying. I think it's an incredibly uninformed opinion, though. Statistics don't support your theory that the problem has been absolved. We haven't even desegregated all our schools which I'm pretty sure is one of the biggest issues. You have schools being funded by a group of people who have historically been the poorest throughout this countries history (by design) and schools being funded by the people who have historically been the richest throughout this countries history (again, by design). The first group does not have the same opportunities as the second. It's silly to think that they do.	All_Fallible	t1_dh3nxti

t3_69431w	t1_dh3r3bp	1493863057	I don't believe that for a second. Many colleges are becoming safe spaces, which creates a culture that abhors information counter to its own. To say "**many** conservative outlets spread bullshit" is interesting, because if that is the perception, then we should be able to acknowledge that "many" does not mean all, so why do liberals protest extraordinarily reasonable conservatives? And not just protest, but attempt to block others from seeing them. Not all conservatives are bad, yet leftists protest them without even knowing their views at all. It seems to me the "smart" thing to do would be to treat each speaker as an individual who, in all likelihood, isn't a white supremacist.	grawz	t1_dh3qnf3

t3_68yz9h	t1_dh3rpqv	1493863855	They are ghettos because black people live there, their own broken mentality of being as anti-white as possible is what causes the hardships they face. The black community has a complete disdain for anything that they consider white such as education, grammar, hard work, resolving things in a peaceful manner etc. Unfortunately society requires you to adopt those things for success. As for statistics, that's a hard thing to prove since statistics can be manipulated to say whatever you want. And schools are all desegregated, the problem is more along the lines of not all school districts have black folk in them, since they are only 13% of the population and don't live in all areas. Honestly, the generational wealth thing is just an excuse. All the people I know who are doing perfectly fine in life(white and black people) grew up just like I did in a broken home in a poor neighborhood. The difference is we chose not to be like our parents. My disdain for all baby-boomers is deep, they are a terrible generation who only do what was best for themselves. School funding everywhere is fucked I'll give you that. In my city they are closing schools, merging high schools from 4 to 2, merging elementary schools, making people drive all the way across the city for middle school, it's a nightmare(Erie, Pa if you're wondering.)	aerovirus22	t1_dh3pdw3
t3_69431w	t1_dh3s31r	1493864296	Basically any conservative you haven't had hammered into your head by the media. Sowell, Shapiro, Crowder is pretty good, Jordan Peterson is into the psychology of Canada's leftist movement. They're all on youtube.  Those are a few good ones. All of these people gladly welcome debate, and the vast majority of the time, those on the left turn them down. Go watch Sowell talk about blacks and it'll change your world.	grawz	t1_dh3rjyf
t3_69431w	t1_dh3t4s5	1493865599	Are these really what you consider "extraordinarily reasonable"?  Jordan Peterson regularly and purposefully misgenders people Shapiro goes on tirades about colleges being indoctrination camps for atheists and homosexuals "If you pay tuition, you're sponsoring the militant homosexual agenda. If you pay taxes, you're sponsoring the militant homosexual agenda. If your child majors in English, you're sponsoring the militant homosexual agenda. Tell Billy to major in math."

A better question is why these people are saying these things, and whether Peterson has anything against transgenderism or whether Shapiro hates gays (they don't).  If you'd like to tell me why they're wrong, then you'll have to know the arguments first.

Keep minimum wage below cost of living. Encourage segregation, hatred of others, and discrimination. BUT make sure that everyone can buy firearms.   What, exactly, do they think people will do when their loved ones are suffering and they can't afford food, housing or medical care? Seriously, I want to know what's supposed to happen next?

It is far from uncommon to see people born blind, deaf, and on a respiration machine, with severe intellectual disability coming in for problems that really should not be of concern. They have physical and occupational therapists come to their house several days per week. They undergo thousands, and in some cases hundreds of thousands worth of surgery. And to what end? Sometimes providing the best care, isn't the best decision. And I'll add, these sorts of patients really aren't uncommon at all.  Again, I'm saying that there is a lot of room for cuts in this department that make a lot of sense. But 'special needs' is a broad category, and still requires some funding.	Polliyon	t3_695k4d

t3_69447o	t1_dh3zse6	1493875896	You keep saying it's a bad move and mentioning the primary, but you still haven't explained *why* it is bad for someone who is not running for office to be a paid speaker.  The primary was about electing a President, and therefore it would look sketchy for someone *who is about to be elected to the highest office in the land* to look like a pay-for-play politician, and that's what everyone was up in arms about during that portion of the election.  That makes sense.  Obama is not holding any office, Obama is not crafting any legislation, Obama is not signing or vetoing any bills that can help or harm any corporate entity, so Wall Street paying him money to speak does not hold the same implications at all.   His association with big wigs or homeless vets or hollywood actors...none of that has anything to do with the Democratic party as an official organization, because right now Obama is basically just a celebrity.	look_at_those_cakes	t1_dh3tls2

You aren't entirely wrong, and they can be manipulated, but statistics are our most valid form of creating an objective analysis. If you're going to choose your first hand experience over what the numbers say then it's pointless to try to convince you. All I can say is that there is no single human being with enough personal experience to fully understand this problem. That's the entire reason we collect data in the first place. Humanity used to be pretty stupid, but then we began to develop ways of analyzing and predicting things. Things like statistics are why we have medicine and space flight. You can choose to dismiss it all, but please try to come up with a better argument than "Well it could be wrong" because statistics were created because human beings are terrible at forming opinions without something objective to use for analysis.

t3_695k4d	t1_dh40diw	1493877111	Right. The [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/trump-religion-executive-order-gay-rights.html?ref=politics) reports that his EO is likely to target the Johnson Amendment, but that a repeal isn't feasible.  They write that his most likely maneuver will be to "direct the I.R.S. not to actively investigate or pursue cases of political activism by members of the clergy."  So, this is how I guess he might just try to neuter the Amendment. He personally benefits from this because he (inexplicably) has the evangelical vote.	Infidel8	t1_dh405yj

He thought Trump was only going to go after the rapists.  And that guy whose dad is about to die from multiple sclerosis and is simultaneously going to drive his entire family bankrupt because it's a 'pre-existing condition?'  Yeah, that guy voted for Trump because he didn't want 'them' freeloading off of his tax dollars.  Somehow it got into the mix that Trump's plans didn't apply to good, law-abiding citizens.  And not only did the voters buy that, hook, line, and sinker, but they still believe it.  They refuse to admit it.  Because admitting you're wrong takes courage, strength, and the horrible realization that you just murdered your own dad.  Or mom.  Or sister, brother, child, neighbor, or any other of the 24 million americans who are going to lose health care, and the other unknown millions who will be denied coverage even though they always paid their bills.

In this video, President Trump harbors the idea that immigration would be a threat to national security and it will end up harming the country eventually, no matter what measures are taken to ensure its comfort and protection. However, immigration can be helpful to the country for both its economic and cultural benefits. The people who make up the United States of America are from all different backgrounds and most have immigrated to this country at one point or another, no matter how far it has to be looked back into. Additionally, immigrants have traditionally been known to boost the economy and have been starters of companies such as google, providing millions of jobs for other American citizens. Overall, immigration is mainly beneficial rendering the allusion to the poem untrue.	skyesourlimit	t3_68f7gx

He expected to scam some people out of their pocket change and maybe start a media network, now he's the goddamned POTUS. He'll be impeached and be a righteous pain in the ass until the end of his miserable days.  Flynn and Manafort both talked, probably under threat of ironclad charges, brought forward because the investigation got to Carter Page before they got to anyone else. That's why he's been so nervous.  The real hammer will come down under the next president, and it'll be retaliation against Russia.

Second, these laws will not affect big media like NYT, CNN, ... very much. They have moneys and the venues to fight Trump.  But it will affect smaller entities.  If you are a blogger or a smaller magazine and you are critical of Trump, and you get a cease-and-desist letter from Sean Spicer.  Then, you have to decide if you want to fight the President of the USA. You'd be audited by the IRS and all shits like that.  Trump is the master at crooked things like this.  Like when he signed $100K contracts, paid people $70K, and tell them to sue him because he knew it would be much more expensive than $30K for these folks to sue him.  Trump is going to screw this country so bad.	vph	t3_697rzw

If Republicans in congress turn on Trump, they lose his alt-right base. In fact, his alt-right base will probably actively try to destroy the Republican party were this to happen...

t3_697rzw	t1_dh4i1xz	1493912447	Darn fact checkers...  Almost makes me sympathetic to Donald Trump. Some of his BS are actually just mistakes or exaggerations. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem capable of admitting that he's wrong unless there isn't any other option and he's totally forced to do it. I bet such forced apologies is the only time he really feels like he's lying. Deep down he's convinced himself that he's right no matter what evidence is presented to the contrary.   BTW, I'm thinking about the Obama birth certificate thing. His retraction just didn't seem to be sincere.	AlienPsychic51	t1_dh4h1c9
t3_697uf1	t1_dh4i2wm	1493912476	The legislation was crafted to go the Reconciliation route, which means the Senate can pass with a simple majority. They're shooting themselves in the foot because, without giving the Dems an opportunity to filibuster and take the blame for blocking it, every single GOP senator will have to go on record voting for the bill if it is to pass.   Whether it passes or not, the GOP are going to own it. They can try whatever logical gymnastics they want to try and point to the Dems regardless of the outcome, but they're still going to own it.  I'm really surprised McConnell is going that route. The filibuster is what gives the GOP cover, being able to publicly support shitty legislation they have no intention of actually passing, knowing the Dems will block it.	maybelying	t1_dh4g8yk

t3_696tsw	t1_dh4i6vg	1493912595	If you're saying to yourself, "republicans in congress will never impeach!"  Republicans care more about staying in congress than they care about Trump.  Trump was always disposable, since Pence is the "better behaved" republican.  So republican congress will get to choose between a backlash from moderates in 2018 if they don't impeach, or President Mike Pence and a lesser backlash.  If they choose not to impeach, they will lose a lot of ground in 2018, and the incoming dems will not be afraid of impeaching Donnie.	lmaccaro	t1_dh4d2d7

t3_696tsw	t1_dh4inul	1493913103	Today, no.  But long term..  Sort of a catch-22.  If republicans are faced with obvious evidence that there was misconduct, they will have to choose between impeaching Trump themselves and taking the base's backlash, or NOT impeaching and facing a moderate/independent/fired up democrat backlash in 2018.  In the second case, incoming democrats may impeach Trump anyhow.  For Republican party leadership, Pence has always been the preferable choice.  He is a much better behaved puppet.	lmaccaro	t1_dh4fk4f
t3_696tsw	t1_dh4ip52	1493913142	There's no doubt that Trump is a flaming pile of shit and will always be a giant black mark on our history, but I'm not so sure he'll be impeached as long as we have an unfortunate Republican majority.	Cinema_King	t3_696tsw
t3_696tsw	t1_dh4ipc9	1493913149	Except that the Chinese trademarks are worth millions of dollars and were given to him after he had become president. That's not an acceptable and "normal" transaction.  China had been holding those trademarks away from him for years and then all of a sudden on one day they all were approved.  A day which I feel I must reiterate was after he was sworn in. No other president has *ever* received anything close to something of a similar value before. You are right that it is without precedent, but we can all see that he is getting a special favor here.	Lorventus	t1_dh4eoai
t3_697uf1	t1_dh4itja	1493913273	That said, he voted to confirm Gorsuch. I was okay with him not supporting the filibuster, and if the filibuster had failed I would have been okay with him voting to confirm. But he voted to confirm *after* the Republicans went nuclear, which I think is shameful, especially given that his vote didn't matter.	ElmoTheNefarious	t1_dh4ih9g
t3_697uf1	t1_dh4ivpj	1493913337	Passing the house and failing in the Senate is the ideal for the GOP.  If it goes to the senate they can blame Democrats for obstructing the bill. "Well we tried but we need to get out the vote in 2018 so we have a filibuster-proof majority!"  If it actually gets passed, even many GOP supporters will be forced to realize what a shit bill it is and it costs them votes.	jaguar879	t1_dh4g81s

t3_697uf1	t1_dh4j3ak	1493913560	These things get discussed with party leadership. I'm very confident he made sure Schumer was ok with his vote before he cast it. You need to understand that Manchin is a Democrat in WV - Trump country.   He needs to be able to say that he has earnestly tried to work with Trump in order to win re-election. Allowing Manchin to vote to confirm Gorsuch is the best way to accomplish this - this wasn't to appeal to stubborn coastal liberals, this was to appeal to voters in WV.   Manchin losing his seat in WV would be devastating to Democrats.	DaBuddahN	t1_dh4itja
t3_697uf1	t1_dh4j3pw	1493913572	I mean...the only other really unforgivable one is Pruitt, the others are merely embarrassing. And Manchin's from West Virginia so it's easy to see why he's not willing to publicly oppose a guy who will deregulate the coal industry, even though it won't do a damn thing to actually help his constituents.  I'm not his biggest fan but I mean...West Virginia. Baby steps.	ElmoTheNefarious	t1_dh4iw9t
t3_697uf1	t1_dh4j6nn	1493913659	I don't disagree. But voting for Gorsuch after they just went nuclear still feels like spooning your rapist.	ElmoTheNefarious	t1_dh4j3ak
t3_697uf1	t1_dh4j7vz	1493913695	I mean, Tillerson, Gorsuch, Haley, Sessions, Mnuchin, McMahon... there's a lot of shit picks in the batch.  Oh and lets not forget Perry, he wasn't even on the list I was looking at, who is now Energy chief. That was a devastating blow.	kyonu	t1_dh4j3pw
t3_697uf1	t1_dh4jaz4	1493913787	But it's deeply strategic and helps Manchin win re-election. We need actual wins, not just symbolic victories.

t3_697uf1	t1_dh4jdae	1493913855	Smart politics, really, precisely *because* his vote didn't matter. He can't knee-jerk vote against everything Trump does, because WV went to Trump in a landslide.

t3_697uf1	t1_dh4jkvh	1493914082	yea but i think it's important to note that manchin is usually a fairly reliable D vote when it matters... of course there are exceptions which is why he's a moderate D... he doesn't vote along party lines about [20% of the time](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/11/here-are-the-members-of-congress-who-vote-against-their-party-the-most/?utm_term=.b1e0d367aea8)...     i say this because ppl on the D side tend to hate him but it's a million times better to have him in that seat instead of say... susan collins...	djphan	t1_dh4j2u0
t3_697uf1	t1_dh4jnlm	1493914164	I think its fair to hate him because of his willingness to accept Trump's nominees, such as Sessions, Gorsuch and Perry, without comment. For starters.	kyonu	t1_dh4jkvh
t3_697uf1	t1_dh4jtkh	1493914348	&gt; Voting against Gorsuch is now not something a 2018 challenger can use against him.  Why not? It feels true; he's a Democrat, right? They're obstructionists and always have been. Better vote Republican just to be safe.	ElmoTheNefarious	t1_dh4jdae

t3_697uf1	t1_dh4k3ne	1493914653	Honestly Haley's been fine. That said...yeah, I guess I managed to block out Sessions and Munchkin.  Perry, though...he's a fucking moron but he seems to be actually trying to do his job instead of actively working to sabotage the federal government, which puts him a cut above the others. I'd say the same about Carson. Both are manifestly unqualified and just not very bright, but they don't actually want to eliminate their own departments (anymore) and sadly enough that makes them the least objectionable members of the cabinet (Alongside Elaine Chao who I have no problem with even though she's the Turtle's wife).

t3_696tsw	t1_dh4kduo	1493914955	Possible. I think it's more likely that impeaching Trump hurts than helps them though.

t3_697uf1	t1_dh4kmq2	1493915218	Lying is in right now. The truth is not an absolute defense in the court of public opinion, because the Republicans can just lie and it's not like their constituents are going to take the NYT's word for it.  I really think the long-term legacy of Trump will be the Republican realization that they can tell implausible lies and, when confronted on them, double down or attack their challenger. So I wouldn't assume that Manchin voting for Gorsuch protects him from being attacked for not voting for Gorsuch.	ElmoTheNefarious	t1_dh4k6or

Your explanation only makes sense if you're talking about someone running for office, because *that* is what the controversy during the primary was about.  It wasn't *just* that Hillary had made paid speeches to Wall Street.   It was that she was getting paid by Wall Street **while she was making plans to run for office.**  So.

"I wish the President -- and I hate to blame everything on him and I don't -- but it would have been helpful had...we had a discussion about this much earlier than the last week."  \*In case you're wondering, here's Obama's statement on the matter given when he vetoed in the first place:  &gt;“JASTA would upset longstanding international principles regarding sovereign immunity, putting in place rules that, if applied globally, could have serious implications for U.S. national interests. The United States has a larger international presence, by far, than any other country, and sovereign immunity principles protect our nation and its Armed Forces, officials, and assistance professionals, from foreign court proceedings. These principles also protect U.S. Government assets from attempted seizure by private litigants abroad. Removing sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated as state sponsors of terrorism, based solely on allegations that such foreign governments' actions abroad had a connection to terrorism-related injuries on U.S. soil, threatens to undermine these longstanding principles that protect the United States, our forces, and our personnel.”	ParanoydAndroid	t1_dh4icds

There is nothing wrong with posting these things but looking over the Heritage article, I notice they frequently make arguments with things "on a level playing field" which is just their way of ignoring variables they don't like.  &gt;Of course, sunny California will always have a natural climate advantage over frigid Minnesota. No one should think that Newark, New Jersey, will ever compete on equal footing with Malibu, California, or that Flint, Michigan will ever be as desirable as Palm Beach, Florida.   Not to mention they cite data already 7 years old...  &gt;While per capita GSP is generally higher in the high-income-tax states for these reasons, growth of per capita GSP is not generally higher in those states. For example, in the 2001–2010 period, per capita GSP grew 37.2 percent in the no-income-tax states, and just 33.4 percent in the high-income-tax states.	12by12by12	t1_dh4p3um

Because China invented their trademark system just for Trump?  &gt;China had been holding those trademarks away from him for years and then all of a sudden on one day they all were approved.  So these were filed for long before Trump started running for President, but the Chinese, having perfected time travel, knew that Trump would become president and they could use these trademark applications as a bribe?  &gt;A day which I feel I must reiterate was after he was sworn in.  Again.  Is this another reference to Chinese time travel capability?  &gt;No other president has ever received anything close to something of a similar value before.

Or we can go to his many overseas hotels and the fact that he now has the leverage of the entire US government on his side, what's to stop him from using that to get a 'better deal' for one of his hotels, or for his son to imply that failing to might cause... unforeseen consequences.   Look, the point is that this isn't some small relatively minor and sorta sideways way to give a president a gift, like buying his book en-mass, this is foreign governments with direct access to Trump's pocketbook able to slip him the billionaire's equivalent of a 20$ anytime they feel they need to nudge him their way.

Moreover, this law is broad enough to apply to any house of worship, up to and including mosques, synagogues, Satanic cults, and your local Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  Evangelicals think that by somehow unshackling their pastors from not being able to talk about politics or endorsing candidates will somehow result in a groundswell of support, but the truth is that their pastors were already supporting candidates and parties, and their faithful already knew who to vote for. The only difference is that now they can launder money, and you know that a group of people that practice the gospel of prosperity are not going to look too closely at where the money is coming from.

t3_696tsw	t1_dh53ho6	1493935626	&gt; they will have to choose between impeaching Trump themselves and taking the base's backlash  Yeah, the GOP "backlash" where they declare everything critical of the golfer-in-chief to be "fake news" and scream that it's smart to give his daughter an office in the white house?  The entire GOP base are traitors to the republic. They would cheer if Russian tanks were rolling down every street in America, as long as liberals were upset.  &gt; or NOT impeaching and facing a moderate/independent/fired up democrat backlash in 2018.  You forgot the third option: waiting til 2018, and screaming "benghazi! emails! pocohontas! liberals! deep state! pizza!"  A fired-up Democrat backlash is a nice idea, but it will need to be absolutely overwhelming in a number of deeply conservative states, to have a chance of defeating the republicans.	dumbposter25	t1_dh4inul

t3_696tsw	t1_dh55zbj	1493938821	I was actually wrong about the electoral statement. Bush had worse ratios which I didn't realize and I apologize for not double checking that. Before that however Jimmy Carter in 1976 was the last president to do worse than trump and in the scheme of presidents Donald Trump ranks 46/58 elections by electoral college points.   Hardly a landslide.   As far as the point of the popular vote you're absolutely no point in winning it as far as political gain. In terms of achieving a 'landslide' victory however I'd mark that as a relatively important criteria. In addition it helps give the president a mandate to justify pursuing their agenda.	bbluech	t1_dh51zhx

The abundance of surgical space, Richards said, will ensure that women visiting the facility can be quickly fitted into stirrups without pausing to second-guess their decision or consider alternatives such as adoption. Hundreds of on-site counselors are also available to meet with clients free of charge and go over the many ways that carrying a child to term will burden them and very likely ruin their lives.  &gt; The remaining space is dedicated to amenities such as coffee shops, bars, dozens of restaurants and retail outlets, a three-story nightclub, and a 10-screen multiplex theater—features intended not only to help clients relax, but to foster a sense of community and make abortion more of a social event.  &gt; "We really want abortion to become a regular part of women's lives, especially younger women who have enough fertile years ahead of them to potentially have dozens of abortions," said Richards, adding that the Abortionplex would provide shuttle service to and from most residences, schools, and shopping malls in the region. "Our hope is for this facility to become a regular destination where a woman in her second trimester can whoop it up at karaoke and then kick back while we vacuum out the contents of her uterus."  &gt; "All women should feel like they have a home at the Abortionplex," Richards continued. "Whether she's a high school junior who doesn't want to go to prom pregnant, a go-getter professional who can't be bothered with the time commitment of raising a child, or a prostitute who knows getting an abortion is the easiest form of birth control—all are welcome."	the_well_hung_jury	t1_dh59sym

I pay towards this system via my taxes, as do all Australian taxpayers. The vast majority of the Australian people are happy with this. It is clearly a fiscally and ethically sound way of going about healthcare. Only a few right-wing nutjobs want a system like that in the US.

The majority party has nothing to gain from compromise - they already hold the reins - and the minority party would only lose support and enthusiasm (especially in opposition to an unpopular president) if they give up on their views for nothing in exchange.

It could convince (some) Republicans that the "poor" have some skin in the game and is a good stepping stone here in the US. Make it a $5-10 co-pay, maybe $50 for hospitalizations, and like $100-250 for surgeries.  You need surgery or to see a doctor? You know it's X dollars. No more guessing or waiting for that bill. And those funds can help offset office costs or something. I'd have no problem with a universal system with a small universal co-pay (and I work with very low-income folks who would jump at this - they fear going and not knowing if something is covered and how much they'll have to pay, so they don't go).	neanderthal85	t1_dh5cnu9

t3_69bogk	t1_dh5gddu	1493953250	AU$10.99 (US$8) for my flu shot this year, at my local pharmacy (Walgreens equivalent). I'm a full fee paying recipient as I fall in the middle aged and otherwise healthy category. Flu shots for the eldery, children, pregnant women (and other at-risk categories like HIV sufferers) are fully subsidized in my state (http://www.dhhs.tas.gov.au/publichealth/communicable_diseases_prevention_unit/infectious_diseases/flu). Although you may have to pay a GP visit fee (although typically that would also be subsidized in bulk-billing clinics).  I lived and worked in the U.S. for 8 years, so I've experienced both healthcare systems. I am perfectly happy paying my higher income tax in Australia to subsidize the universal healthcare system for all. Although, as I have the disposable income to support it, I do also hold private health insurance in addition to my public insurance and have all of my life. Whilst I have the financial means to utilize private services, I do so. Falling back to the public services only when I absolutely have to. It's my safety net which is it's intended purpose.  I was lucky while living in the U.S. to work for employers who offered excellent benefits (higher education and multinational companies) so I was better off than most people but I still stressed out about medical costs and unexpected bills. This was both pre-"Ombacare" and post-"Obamacare" although I left the U.S. 2 years into the implementation. My youngest was born in the U.S. and I remember still how the bills just kept rolling in for eight months, from different suppliers and vendors, some in-plan and some out of plan.

If I’m being completely honest, I’ve thought of ending my life if it comes to that,” she said.  &gt;High risk pools run by the state are not the answer, she says.

She and her husband both work full time, but wouldn’t be able to afford the roughly $600,000 a year her treatments cost once the cap is met.  &gt;“I have really lost my faith in humanity,” she said. “It’s terrible how little we care for the sick.”  Republicans are willing to kill this small business owner for tax breaks to the top 2%.	colby-klaus	t3_69cs9r

He worked for Jon Stewart for eight years before that.  So he's been doing political comedy for 20 years. Coming up with original material is in fact hard. He never had the audience you claim he'll lose and I assure you doesn't want them. He can live without that demographic and always has, and has gone on to helm the Late Show for his efforts.

Trump gets things done on a businessman's schedule (not the typical govt. turtle pace)  As such, i bet Trump gets the senate to do their job within the month.  Every time the liberals try to say he won't be able to do something, Trump defies their expectations and gets it done anyway.

t3_69d1aw	t1_dh5n8di	1493965667	That doesn't even make any sense grammatically, let alone logically. Socialism is a social and economic theory where as Nazism and Totalitarianism are political ideologies. Nazism can become Totalitarianism but neither can become Socialism or vice versa.   Hitler's economic views were back and forth. On one hand, he espoused Marxist Socialism. On the other, he vowed to protect private property. So perhaps technically he was a Socialist, but he was not a purebred Socialist. Perhaps a better word is Reformist, or Third Way economist. But if you want to insist he was Socialist that's fine, it still doesn't mean Nazism was Socialism because that just doesn't make any fucking sense.	PhyterNL	t3_69d1aw

t3_69d1aw	t1_dh5npc1	1493966787	On the Mises Institute – I don't understand how you can have a so-called economic theory and in basic premise reject mathematical modeling. All that's left is ideologues arguing unprovable philosophy unscientifically. We're not spherical chickens in a vacuum, any more than we are rational actors acting independently in our own self-interest. It's a great story, but Objectivism is just a bizarrely  simplified Romantic vision of a hard discipline, and warrants all the intellectual attention that deserves. This is a fine example of that facile simplicity. He take a shoehorn and fit the words into whatever thesis he wants, ignoring what he wants to get the result he decided was true at the get-go. It's just another example of top-down motivated thinking – any position can be rationalized if you try hard enough. It doesn't, however, make you right.	morvus_thenu	t3_69d1aw

t3_69d1aw	t1_dh5nuff	1493967128	National Socialism was just a phrase to convince moderates and centre-leftists that it had something to do with socialism and pro-labor. Ideologically speaking Nazism/National Socialism follows a fascist economy. And by that I mean that it has a capitalist base where monopolies and large corporations still existed and the means of production were control by the bourgeoisie while the state controlled/heavily subsidized certain industries for imperialistic reasons, like weapons manufacturing. Every tenet National Socialism has is pro-Social Darwinism. Thus against the very core of socialism, social equality.  It was originally the German Workers Party, Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, it wasn't until Hitler arrived on the scene and in an attempt to draw the workers of Munich and Bavaria in general to their meetings they used Nationalsozialistische, National Socialist, as an addendum to the party name to draw people curious in radical politics. The Nazis even used posters that used a similar vein to left wing parties. This is why eventually they had to create the Sturmabteilung or SA because workers would show up and get pissed that it was fascist bullshit and attack the speakers with clubs, knives, or guns. It wasn't uncommon for Hitler to be shot at during speeches.  The idea that workers controlled the means of production in Nazi Germany is a bitter joke. It was actually a combination of aristocracy and capitalism. Technically, private businessmen owned and controlled the means of production. The Nazi "Charter of Labor" gave employers complete power over their workers. It established the employer as the "leader of the enterprise," and read: "The leader of the enterprise makes the decisions for the employees and laborers in all matters concerning the enterprise." (1)  The employer, however, was subject to the frequent orders of the ruling Nazi elite. After the Nazis took power in 1933, they quickly established a highly controlled war economy under the direction of Dr. Hjalmar Schacht. Like all war economies, it boomed, making Germany the second nation to recover fully from the Great Depression, in 1936. (The first nation was Sweden, in 1934. Following Keynesian-like policies, the Swedish government spent its way out of the Depression, proving that state economic policies can be successful without resorting to dictatorship or war.) Prior to the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, worker protests had spread all across Germany in response to the Great Depression. During his drive to power, Hitler exploited this social unrest by promising workers to strengthen their labor unions and increase their standard of living. But these were empty promises; privately, he was reassuring wealthy German businessmen that he would crack down on labor once he achieved power. Historian William Shirer describes the Nazi's dual strategy:  "The party had to play both sides of the tracks. It had to allow [Nazi officials] Strasser, Goebbels and the crank Feder to beguile the masses with the cry that the National Socialists were truly 'socialists' and against the money barons. On the other hand, money to keep the party going had to be wheedled out of those who had an ample supply of it." (2) Once in power, Hitler showed his true colors by promptly breaking all his promises to workers. The Nazis abolished trade unions, collective bargaining and the right to strike. An organization called the "Labor Front" replaced the old trade unions, but it was an instrument of the Nazi party and did not represent workers. According to the law that created it, "Its task is to see that every individual should be able… to perform the maximum of work." Workers would indeed greatly boost their productivity under Nazi rule. But they also became exploited. Between 1932 and 1936, workers wages fell, from 20.4 to 19.5 cents an hour for skilled labor, and from 16.1 to 13 cents an hour for unskilled labor. (3) Yet workers did not protest. This was partly because the Nazis had restored order to the economy, but an even bigger reason was that the Nazis would have cracked down on any protest. There was no part of Nazism, therefore, that even remotely resembled socialism. http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-hitler.htm  Hitler quotes:  "The German state is gravely attacked by Marxism." (34)  "In the years 1913 and 1914, I… expressed the conviction that the question of the future of the German nation was the question of destroying Marxism." (35)  "In the economic sphere Communism is analogous to democracy in the political sphere." (36)  "The Marxists will march with democracy until they succeed in indirectly obtaining for their criminal aims the support of even the national intellectual world, destined by them for extinction." (37)  "Marxism itself systematically plans to hand the world over to the Jews." (38)  "The Jewish doctrine of Marxism rejects the aristocratic principle of Nature and replaces the eternal privilege of power and strength by the mass of numbers and their dead weight." (39)  Hitler: Our adopted term ‘Socialist has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not.  Hitler: First Hermann Goering gave a short speech in which he emphasized the importance of the current election campaign. Then Hitler appeared and gave a ninety-minute speech. He praised the concept of private property and argued that the Nazi Party would be the nation's only salvation against the communist threat. The basis of the Nazi Party is the national idea and the concern over the nation's defense capabilities. Life is a continuous struggle and only the fittest could survive. Concurrently, only a militarily fit nation could thrive economically.  TL;DR : Libertarians, in general, have as much of a grasp on socialist theory as a dog has on table manners. Dare I say they are often even purposely misleading in their labeling of everything as 'socialism' and 'evil'.   I am an ex-libertarian btw, and no I'm not a liberal like many on this subreddit  **The communists were literally Hitler's first target once in power.**	GaB91	t3_69d1aw

t3_69d1aw	t1_dh5ox4s	1493969849	Exactly. My gripe with classical libertarianism is that they it is very quick to criticize tyranny of the state; but scarcely, if ever, recognizes tyranny from private powers. In the current system, the only reactive mechanism that the people have is their government (at least in theory, not in practice). If we remove private power, however, then the role of the state becomes increasingly unnecessary. This is the basic idea behind libertarian socialism which I believe is the only sensible implementation of libertarianism.	StormSS	t1_dh5nsdb

I'll save it for the next time someone learns what the S in NSDAP stands for and takes it literally.  &gt; Following Keynesian-like policies, the Swedish government spent its way out of the Depression, proving that state economic policies can be successful without resorting to dictatorship or war.  The Nazis also spent their way to economic recovery. Infrastructure spending was a minor part in that, it was almost entirely through rearmament, which they financed through [hidden debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mefo_bills). They knew from the very beginning that the currency and economy would eventually collapse if they don't start a major war in time.  &gt; Hitler: Our adopted term ‘Socialist has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not.  The Guardian has a reprint of [an early interview](https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/sep/17/greatinterviews1) with Hitler from 1923 where he goes into more depth on this:  *"Why," I asked Hitler, "do you call yourself a National Socialist, since your party programme is the very antithesis of that commonly accredited to socialism?"*  *"Socialism," he retorted, putting down his cup of tea, pugnaciously, "is the science of dealing with the common weal. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists.*  *"Socialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism, it involves no negation of personality, and unlike Marxism, it is patriotic.*  *"We might have called ourselves the Liberal Party. We chose to call ourselves the National Socialists. We are not internationalists. Our socialism is national. We demand the fulfilment of the just claims of the productive classes by the state on the basis of race solidarity. To us state and race are one."*  &gt; "The party had to play both sides of the tracks. It had to allow [Nazi officials] Strasser, Goebbels and the crank Feder to beguile the masses with the cry that the National Socialists were truly 'socialists' and against the money barons. [..]"  According to *Mein Kampf*, the crank [Feder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Feder) with his theory of the "two kinds of capital" (owning a corporation: good, any income through financial capital: bad/Jewish) was who had originally convinced Hitler to join the DAP. He was sidelined later when the NSDAP needed capitalists to essentially invest in the party, which is kinda ironic when you think about it.    Goebbels [reportedly](http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-43063529.html) used a German play on words that clarifies Feder's theory's standing in the party. Feder first explained his theory in his *Manifest on breaking the shackles of interest servitude*. In German, *brechen* can mean *to break* and *to throw up*. Goebbels said that "if someone has to *break* [throw up], it's the one who has to listen to this nonsense."  Of the Strasser brothers, who arguably represented something like the "left wing" of the party, one was murdered during the *Night of the Long Knifes*, [the other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Strasser) had already fled the country when Hitler came to power.

t3_69d1aw	t1_dh5q0ui	1493972970	&gt;  On one hand, he espoused Marxist Socialism.  No. Absolutely not:  *"Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists."*  What Hitler meant by "socialism" has nothing to do with what you, I, or even anybody at the time who wasn't a Nazi, understood when they heard the term.

t3_69ddpu	t1_dh5rfxb	1493977320	Am I the only one who thinks that government doesn't need to be in every fucking facet of our lives? American health care is never going to be like it is in the UK, Australia, or Canada.  Many people who are for government care point to those countries.   The way insurance is set up with lobbyists, individual care, prescription medicine, pharmaceutical companies; all of that stuff is different, so I don't think the ability to make health care like it is in those countries is even possible.    Any system America has that gets the government involved in something it probably shouldn't be in is not going to be perfect.   I'd doubt if it would even be good.   However, once you give people something, it's very hard to take it away, especially if it's something very expensive, nice, or may be necessary down the road.  Personally speaking, as a healthy young person with no major health problems and employer-provided health care this bill would actually probably benefit me as long as I stay healthy.   It means I'm not paying for people who are already sick and are paying tiny amounts in to the system, which increases the cost for me.   Some might say that the cost is divided among healthy people when the poorer people without health insurance can't pay, but being that I only get a sinus infection once a year and don't need to go to the doctor, my insurance is actually higher than it has been due to the ACA.   I'm interested in what this bill will actually do IF it passes the Senate.   I'm expecting MY premiums will probably go down which will benefit MY money in the end of the day.     I really don't the threat of a high-cost hospital stay would be an incentive for people to GET healthy, as most Americans won't do extra work unless they get paid for it up front, or are at risk of having something very bad or very expensive imminent if that work (ie exercise, lower sugar intake) does not take place.  I know a lot of people on this sub might disagree with me and downvote me because of it, even though I'm contributing to the discussion, but I'd be happy to engage anyone in a civil conversation about the state of our health care and how bloated government has gotten.   We could put aside the "what ifs" catastrophic situations that only happen to a tiny bit of the population.   The fact is, this huge, growing government is costing us more in the long run than this health care thing by itself ever will!	Caffeinetank	t3_69ddpu

t3_69bogk	t1_dh5s3rr	1493979284	Personal anecdote but last year I was in a motorcycle accident which resulted in an ambulance ride to hospital, broken clavicle and some stitches.   Total medical cost was about $10 for some ibuprofen a few weeks later to help with swelling. Everything else was covered between Medicare and third party insurance which is required to register a vehicle in Australia.  Always feel sorry hearing about people who break their arms in an accident in the US without insurance and end up with bills in the thousands.	serideth	t3_69bogk

t3_69bogk	t1_dh5sig5	1493980431	So basically in Australia anything done in a hospital can be done for free. E.g. Having a baby, getting cancer, having tonsils out, having diabetes reviews. A majority of community health is also free, so kid got a runny nose, got a sore back etc. All essential pathology and basically all pathology testing  is free. Radiology is free for xrays and ct scans. Some places ultrasounds are free. Mri are free for certain conditions in the community. Even stress echocarograms, pet scans, myocardial perfusion scans are often free. One month supply of any drug the government agrees is important and worth paying for is 37 bucks at most, and about 7 bucks if you are poor. If you spend a certain amount of money on prescription drugs in a year they become free. So... Basically the government's plan is anything which is required to keep you alive or avoid permanent injury is free and timely. Anything that's done to avoid suffering e.g hip replacement In old lady with arthritis.. Wait list is probably 12 months and a system that kicks people of the waiting lists and makes them reapply if they miss appointments. Same with drugs, hey fever medication for example isn't on the pbs, gotta pay yo self.  So basically Australian government sets the price of every drug, investigation, form of therapy, operation, dietitian visit etc etc. So that is the public system, there is a also a private system which in which the main advantage is that things happen allot quicker, e.g. that year wait for a new hip is now 3 weeks. Downside is it costs money. The government will front up what they are willing and then you and your insurance company pay the rest. How much varies as to your plan, how much the specialist/hospital want to charge you.  Also, Australian government doesn't cover any dental so only way you can get that for free without insurance is to go to a training clinic or have a problem bad enough a maxillofacial surgeon will treat you in the public system... Source, doctor in Australia typing on my phone   I will say one more thing, the public system for adults (for children everything is still awesome) is designed to make it a little user unfriendly/tough love so that people who can use the private system will instead... Or maybe it's not on purpose but regardless getting shit done through the private system is easier because they want your money so they make it as easy as possible... Now there are plenty of exceptions where people can't get the services they need but that is very much an uncommon issue	nerrr	t1_dh5bm33
t3_69bogk	t1_dh5sitr	1493980462	4 years ago i had 2 slipped discs and a bulged disk in my lower spin. Had scans done the day i presented at hospital with immense pain, they told me to come back the next day for the results of the scan. I got a phone call at 11pm that night from someone at the hospital asking if someone could drop me back in or they would send someone to come and pick me up due to them finding out about the discs.  I was made comfortable and doped up on painkillers then transported 4 hours down the east coast to Newcastle Hospital where i had spinal surgery the next day, then spent 3 weeks in that hospital getting physio and painkillers galore, i was on a ketamine infusion and a morphine drip among a concoction of other tablets every 4 hours like clockwork. i had to get showered by people and needed help going to the bathroom, i was basically a mess of a man who relied heavy on the system and it provided flawlessly.   After i got the use of my bowel and bladder back after getting weaned off the meds i got transferred back to my local hospital where i stayed for a few more days for observation and more physio. Then went home.  Never once even saw or heard about a bill, all they needed was my medicare number when i went in for my initial scan.  We take the system for granted because we just see it as normal and don't realise how unbelievably well we have it.	WD-4O	t1_dh5bm33

We need to get our priorities straight and understand that if we want things like crime and drug use to go down, a bigger police force isn't the answer, trying to end poverty is the answer. A big step towards that is socialized medicine. That is something you will actually benefit from in countless ways. Military? No so much.	madusldasl	t1_dh5s49f

t3_69ddpu	t1_dh5wloc	1493988854	Okay, first off, funding for the defense of our country and the defense of other countries is not stealing.   It's part of keeping the world safe from crazy leaders like the Kims in North Korea.  Also, stealing from other people is not compassion.   Just because someone's heart is beating, they get free stuff?   How is it my fault that I went to school, took out my student loans, became gainfully employed, paid those loans back, and made good decisions so I can have stuff?     What gives you or anyone else the right to take that out of my pocket and give it to someone else?   It's not my fault they made bad decisions and majored in something like visual art, music, or gender studies and now work at a small restaurant that doesn't pay for their health insurance.  It's morally wrong to take something from me that I EARNED and give it to someone else who is simply breathing.     Going back to the military, there is one reason that Seoul is not a nuclear wasteland right now.   It's not because South Korea is some nuclear superpower.   In fact, they don't have nuclear weapons at all and have abandoned their nuclear arms program even though they knew North Korea had one.   They don't have nuclear weapons because their closest ally, the USA has over 3,000 of them!   In fact, that's probably the only reason Seoul isn't a nuclear wasteland right now.   While we may think that Kim Jong Un is crazy and eccentric, he's not stupid enough to do that because he knows that his country will be turned in to a glowing sandbox if he did!   He knows the US military will respond and respond quickly if he was foolish enough to actually put a nuclear warhead on those missiles he's so fond of launching and lobbed them in the direction of Japan or South Korea.   He hasn't even fired a missile at them (why he fires them in to the sea) because he fears what the US might do to him.  He pretends not to care, but he doesn't want to govern a nation where everyone has died in a nuclear exchange.  Who's the only country that is standing with our allies in the Middle East and getting rid of those bloodthirsty savages in ISIS?  Who's actually the one putting people on the ground, saving hostages, and striking back at those who deliberately and maliciously using chemical weapons against and executing innocent civilians?  Who was the one force that stood between the Soviet Union and central and western Europe?   I'll give you a hint -- Stalin, Khrushchev, and Brezhnev weren't afraid of the Swedish military!   They didn't face off against British tanks in Berlin.    It wasn't Argentina that Cuba was afraid of in 1962 that led to the missiles being pulled out of that country! Who was the main force stopping the genocide happening in Bosnia?   Who was dropping the bombs on the Serbians who were killing civilians?   It wasn't the United Nations -- they're only allowed to fire on people firing on them.   If you don't believe that, look up the Srebrenica Massacre, where Dutch troops had to stand by and WATCH boys and men being killed by a paramilitary Serbian unit?   Over 8,000 of them were killed and over 20,000 women were deported and the Dutch troops were powerless!    The US military stepped in, that's who.   We weren't the only force, but we were the most powerful, the most feared.  I support our military.  I am FINE with supporting them.  I know there's always a boogeyman out there, and there will always be another one coming up.   Some of these might be smaller than we think, but some might be larger -- there are always threats, and the United States military is the one that will always step up, no matter what people say about us, no matter what other countries might think, we are going to be there to save those who are in need.  We will be there to stop the bad men.  We will be there to help if it really is necessary.     THAT is what compassion is, my friend.  Stealing is not compassion.	Caffeinetank	t1_dh5tf31

Maybe not the Republican party, but I have no doubt that if he came out in public support of a single payer system, his voters would do a complete 180 because they're nothing more than blinded dipshits who hang on his every word and support whatever he or the party says is good. They'd drop the *"that's socialism!"* talking point fast as fuck if a prominent Republican started selling them on it.   He could come out in support of it, fire up his base, go on another campaign tour across country, and get his voters fired up and calling to harass their representatives in to supporting it.   But he won't do that. That would actually take courage in standing up to the party bosses like Ryan and McConnell. So, instead, he'll continue to try to spin this abomination of a healthcare bill in to something positive just so he can potentially achieve his first legislative *"victory."*   Fucking coward.

t3_69ddpu	t1_dh5xozv	1493990484	Lol we will have to agree to disagree on this one I guess. But I just believe people with your mindset have trouble seeing past their own front door and how the stability and safety of society that you enjoy along with everyone else has been achieved by taxing, or "stealing" what is yours in order to achieve that society. History has taught us over thousands of years that we improve our own situation when we lift up those around us. And when we shut ourselves off from the world and refuse to engage in society, things start to trend downwards. It's hard to see sometimes, but you and I do benefit greatly when everyone in society can access healthcare services without going into crippling debt. We benefit when everyone can take advantage of higher education. We benefit when poverty levels drop. The most effective use of our tax dollars would be to spend them towards those goals. Our military is operating just fine, I don't see how $53 billion more military spending is more crucial than lifting up the less fortunate around us. I always thought that the republicans should be on board with this since they claim to be the party or morality. What's more morally deficient than turning your back on those in need?	madusldasl	t1_dh5wloc

I don't think that you realize how good you have it to not have been born with such a condition, or into deep poverty. I bet you'd be singing a vastly different tune if you were in one of those positions.

t3_69ddpu	t1_dh61k1z	1493995431	Our military is weaker than it has ever been.   The sequester was horrible for our military.    I come from a state where there are quite a few military bases, and I have had many conversations with both active and retired military personnel, and this was the first time they actually had to lay off NCO's or push the older ones in to retirement, without any plans to replace them. Our military is smaller than it has been since before WWII -- before we became a superpower.   Whether you believe it or not, the United States has an obligation to protect others.  I'm not why you think I'm not looking beyond my front door.   I see way past it.  I am talking about the United States on a world stage while you are talking domestic issues.  You say that history has taught us we improve our own situation when we lift up those around us -- history has also taught us that we improve our own situation when people have to EARN things rather than have them given to them because they are breathing.   Look at the explosion in our economy post-WWII.   The GI's came home and began to make businesses, join industry, and build our economy.   That catapulted us as both an economic and military giant.   That made poverty drop.  How is stealing going to take away poverty?  It isn't.    Don't get me wrong, I do think there needs to be some type of safety net for those who come on hard times, but we need to give them a hand up, not a hand out. The welfare system as we have it is broken.  There's no incentive to work harder, because food is on the table, clothes are on their back, and maybe they have a little left over.   There's no incentive to go back to school and get a real education.   Heck, there's not any incentive to get married before popping out kids.     I've taught in an impovershed area and I have seen what the welfare system has done.   It has created a generation of females who will get pregnant at age 16, and then will either drop out of school or let the grandparents take care of that child, getting no parenting skills of their own.   Guess what happens when their daughter is 16 or younger?  Yeah, you guessed it, she gets pregnant, and the cycle starts over again, but this time it's with a grandmother who has little to no parenting skills of her own, only resulting in a child that has little to no discipline and there's STILL no incentive to get out of that rut, and history repeats itself.  Do you know what LBJ said when he instituted the Great Society?  I won't say it on here because it has a racial slur, but you can look it up.  So, you see what welfare really does?   It's giving people money for doing nothing other than breathing.   It was the same way with health care.   It only got worse under Obama, as 32% more Americans were added to the food stamp program.   He had a recession to deal with, but it was dealt with, and the economy has begun to upright itself.  What I'm saying is that throwing more money at a problem is not going to fix anything.  The economy eventually fixes itself, but we've never seen a growth like we did post WWII -- when people actually helped themselves!  What's more morally deficient than allowing people to get a HAND OUT while STEALING from those who worked for it?!  It was not fair to begin with by taxing Americans who worked hard and made good decisions more because of those who were partly a dead weight on society (not all of them, but I'm talking about the single welfare moms I spoke of earlier) and did nothing to further themselves.  I'd really like the government to completely stay out of health care.  I wrote a post on it earlier if you feel to peruse my posts.  However, this looks like it's more of a step in the right direction as it's less money coming out of my pocket to pay for those who don't even want health care to begin with.   You speak compassion and morality, but you can't speak about that while at the same time saying that it's right to steal from others and to yearn for what they have.  The best thing would be to give them an incentive to make good decisions and do good things rather than a hand out because they're breathing.   I'd like to thank you for the civil discussion we had and conducting yourself in such a way.   I can see we have stark differences on what we think is best for the country.   I'm more of a Libertarian than anything else when it comes to the federal government (with some differences, such as the military), and we won't see eye to eye.   We both see compassion and morality through different lenses, and that's perfectly okay.   I don't see how you can justify taking from others who have earned something, and you don't see how I can justify not giving handouts to those you feel "need" it.	Caffeinetank	t1_dh5xozv

t3_69ddpu	t1_dh62h5q	1493996490	Socialism is theft.  That's what I was referring to.   However, we're slowly devolving into it.  I could go over the social contract and what it covers, but Rousseau, Hobbes and Locke did not mean that it entitles someone to everything under the sun simply because they're breathing.    The welfare state, socialism, and Marxism is way after their time, so the ideology of what states have become would be muddied in their ideology.  For example, Locke's life, liberty, and property -- what to do when it's state property?  Does that belong to everyone as a collective?   What if there is not enough of that property to go around?   For example -- what if a doctor does not want to spend tens of thousands of dollars and the prime years of his/her life to become a doctor if due to state-run health care they are not going to be able to pay back those student loans?    He could just open up a private practice and make big bucks.    If enough doctors did that (and I've seen a few opt to do this, as Medicaid doesn't pay as well as private insurance), then we would have a shortage.  Giving everyone health insurance under the sun, as the years go by, could put a strain on the system, with less people at the top of their class going in to the medical profession or opting for private practice while the number of patients grows.      THAT would be a system really collapsing on itself, and it would cause a figurative black hole that would swallow up a lot of things.  It's one of the many bad things that could happen with a bad system and a bloated government that promises too much on things it cannot deliver.	Caffeinetank	t1_dh5zpxq

Sixty percent of Americans believe the government should guarantee health care, according to a recent Pew study, and even Republicans have moved toward this position.   Hopefully this current bill fails and Trump goes for universal care. Honestly it's the only thing I could think of that would win him back any support.	Bluthhousing	t3_69eepm

According to a [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-administration-hires-official-five-students-accused-sexual-assault) investigation published this week, the State Department’s assistant chief of visits, Steven Munoz — who supervises up to ten staffers as they organize visits of foreign heads of state — was accused of sexual assault by five different students during his time at the Citadel, a military college in Charleston, South Carolina. And although a local prosecutor declined to press charges against Munoz, an investigation by the school found that “certain assaults likely occurred.”  - if you can't keep it in the family, keep it in the administration.	wonderingsocrates	t3_69foag

Add the hardcore Trump supporters who will support it if Trump does and it will be even higher.  Trump is totally incompetent at nearly everything needed to be in government, but he is a hell of a salesman.  Part of what makes him so good at sales is his ability to frame certain things in a negative light to get people to buy what he is selling as a solution.  All he has to do is point and say, "Oh look!  Paul Ryan is being paid by X to vote against the American people!  Get 'em out of here!"  You know how rowdy the people have been about health care in town halls lately?  Add Trump supporters to that.

Then even if you do manage to get your business off the ground, you're expected to cover your employees. Even if it's not legally mandated for a small crew, to get good people you have to offer benefits. The costs of plans soar every year; this was true pre-ACA and it seems to be true today to some extent as well.

t3_69eepm	t1_dh6c0sl	1494007451	yeah... no.  that's not how our government works.  you can't pass laws or institute programs on a federal level if they are not crafted in the house or senate, run through, voted on, and passed in committee, brought to the house or senate floor for voting, passed there, then sent to the other branch (house or senate) for them to read/edit/vote on their own version, reconciled, and then given to the president to sign into law.  and the kicker is that the speaker of the house (and i believe senate majority leader though i'm less sure on that one) has the power to call for a vote on any bill he wants to, and has the power to ignore any bill he wants to.  if it doesn't get called for a vote, it doesn't pass.  period.  and the whole "get 'em out of here!" doesn't work either, because there's a complex process to remove speaker of the house... he either has to lose his election or step down willingly (like boehner did).  since ryan's all KINDS of happy thinking he's king shit of turd hill, and he's in one of the more gerrymandered/tea partyish-conservative districts in wisconsin, it's unlikely he's going anywhere anytime soon.  and that's not even including the fact that trump has his own administration against him.  bannon would NEVER let him specifically call for single-payer, because bannon wants to eliminate government intervention.  pence would argue against it because he's just evil and "only good people deserve good health."  so in this case, no... to get around ryan and the freedom caucus, you'd have to physically remove them from government, along with their counterparts in the senate.	kaett	t1_dh69ofk

t3_69eepm	t1_dh6icd4	1494015637	Single payer can work in America, and it can work without screwing the healthcare industry by expecting them to all take a big pay cut or shareholders in healthcare companies getting a huge decrease in stock value.  It also doesn't need to be some socialistic government takeover of a trillion dollar industry.  It's a math problem.  Currently, those of us with health care pay a lot of money for that insurance in premiums, co-pays, etc. A family of four can expect to pay over $1000 a month just to have insurance. We need to spread that cost around to everyone. That's why the Affordable Care Act has a provision where people must get insurance or pay a fine.  Some people get better rates if they work for a large company. The company has the leverage to negotiate better rates and they can also spread the cost across their many healthy employees defraying the cost of their few sick employees.  At its core, single payer means a single pool of people. Instead of one person buying insurance directly, another person in a small business getting insurance with a few other employees, and some giant company getting plans for all their employees, instead we all pay into the same place.  Where is becomes a math problem, and a solvable math problem, is how we spread the cost around. Let's use the $1000/month for a family of four, for $250 per person. Let's say that's what it really costs for a big healthcare provider to cover four people, so they can pay their doctors and staff what they are paying now, and their shareholders make some money. Instead of each family paying in based on separately negotiated rates, we all pay into a common pool via taxes. This could be by expanding Medicare, or creating a new pool. There would be some difference in what each family pays based on their income level. What's important is the math. Using the $250 per person * 321 million Americans, that's the amount of money we need in the pool each year. If you work at a minimum wage job, you pay less than $250. If you are a Fortune 500 CEO, you pay more. The $250 number might go down once we are all in the same pool, and all spreading the cost around. No more having people who pay for insurance having to pick up some of the cost for people who show up at the ER with no insurance.  Again, it's math. The percentages can be sliced and diced and endlessly debated in Congress, but at the end of the day, if you have enough money in the single payer pool, both the minimum wage person and the 1% person can walk into their local United Healthcare, Blue Cross, or other provider and sign up for coverage. The company bills the single payer pool $250 per person. That amount should provide for at least basic healthcare. What defines basic healthcare would also be an endless debate, co-pays, deductibles, etc. There could still be supplemental healthcare on top of the basic “single payer”. Employers could still offer that as a benefits. It could lower co-pays and deductibles and cover more medical issues.  Keeping our society health does benefit everyone. CEOs have a healthier workforce, and healthy consumers who can stay employees and buy more stuff. It could also cut down on expensive medical procedures if people could go to the doctor at minimal cost when they first get sick.  This single payer system isn't all that different from how Social Security works, or Medicare for old people, or unemployment insurance. We all pay into those programs out of our paychecks, and at a percentage based on our income level. The reason people keep saying Social Security is running out of money is again, a math problem, we collectively pay in less money that we collectively take out. Sure, I'm ignoring the political reality of voters getting upset with they have to pay more and/or receive less, but as they say "money doesn't grow on trees".	RileyWWarrick	t3_69eepm

t3_69eepm	t1_dh6kbh9	1494018026	Thanks for the remedial lesson about how government works.  I saw that episode of Schoolhouse Rock too, lol.    &gt; and the whole "get 'em out of here!" doesn't work either, because there's a complex process to remove speaker of the house...   I should have been more specific about the "'em" to whom I was referring.  Specifically, it was the people paying Ryan and the Freedom Caucus to vote against the American people.  But generally I was alluding to an example of Trump directing the anger of his supporters and them responding in a rowdy way that I think would probably terrify most congress people.  &gt; he either has to lose his election   This is what it's all about.  If a congressional candidate running for re-election sees a very vocal, very angry, very large majority of their constituents wanting Medicare for all you don't think they wouldn't sell out and go with it if they thought their re-election depended on it?  You think Paul Ryan is corrupt enough to give a death sentence to thousands of people for being poor to get re-elected but *not* corrupt enough to let a Medicare for all vote go to the floor?  &gt; and that's not even including the fact that trump has his own administration against him.  You have this backwards.  The administration serves at the pleasure of the president.  Trump's teeny, tiny ego may allow for members of the administration to disagree with each other, but not with him.  Bannon doesn't "let" Trump do anything, it's the other way around.  If this was something Trump really wanted, Bannon gets with it or Bannon gets fired.  And while Trump can't actually fire Pence, he has absolutely no problem making his life a living hell.  Trump would humiliate him over and over again, trample on his agenda and do the opposite just because it would make Pence angry.  Trump doesn't make any of this a secret.  He has threatened this kind of thing openly before.  And he's done it before.  So while I admit it isn't a likely scenario, Trump could actually do this if he wanted to.  It wouldn't be easy, but it is absolutely possible.	TroopBeverlyHills	t1_dh6c0sl

t3_69fa14	t1_dh6kdlc	1494018095	The gentle slope 10 days prior was "reversion to the mean"--there were no significant news stories during that period to drive the change. The data shows that undecideds broke for Trump very late.  &gt;Is it possible this was all just a coincidence — that Clinton’s numbers went into decline for reasons other than Comey’s letter? I think there’s a decent case (which we’ll take up in a moment) that some of the decline in Clinton’s numbers reflected reversion to the mean and was bound to happen anyway.  &gt;But it’s not credible to claim that the Comey letter had no effect at all. It was the dominant story of the last 10 days of the campaign. According to the news aggregation site Memeorandum, which algorithmically tracks which stories are gaining the most traction in the mainstream media, the Comey letter was the lead story on six out of seven mornings from Oct. 29 to Nov. 4, pausing only for a half-day stretch when Mother Jones and Slate published stories alleging ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.  &gt;It’s rare to see stories linger in headlines for more than two to three days given how quickly the news cycle moves during election campaigns. When one does, some effect on the polls is often expected. And that’s what we saw. The sharpness of the decline — with Clinton losing 3 points in a week4 — is consistent with a news-driven shift, rather than gradual reversion to the mean.  &gt;We also have a lot of other evidence of shifting preferences among voters in the waning days of the campaign. Exit polls showed that undecided and late-deciding voters broke toward Trump, especially in the Midwest. A panel survey conducted by FiveThirtyEight contributor Dan Hopkins and other researchers also found shifts between mid-October and the end of the campaign — an effect that would amount to a swing of about 4 percentage points against Clinton.5 And we know that previous email-related stories had caused trouble for Clinton in the polls. In July, when Comey said he wouldn’t recommend charges against Clinton but rebuked her handling of classified information, she lost about 2 percentage points in the polls. Periods of intense coverage of her email server had also been associated with polling declines during the Democratic primary.  &gt;So while one can debate the magnitude of the effect, there’s a reasonably clear consensus of the evidence that the Comey letter mattered — probably by enough to swing the election. This ought not be one of the more controversial facts about the 2016 campaign; the data is pretty straightforward. Why the media covered the story as it did and how to weigh the Comey letter against the other causes for Clinton’s defeat are the more complicated parts of the story.

t3_69431w	t1_dh6o8lz	1494023241	As far as I am aware, Shapiro believes government should get out of marriage entirely. If you want marriage equality, take it away from heterosexuals, otherwise you'll end up with 90 different forms of marriage when everyone begs the government to support their form. It'd create a massive bureaucracy for absolutely no benefit to society (divorce rate++), while taking government out of marriage would make everyone perfectly equal.  In any case, just as you (probably) don't want tax dollars spent on religion, we don't want tax dollars spent on political agendas, homosexual or not. He's probably referring to English courses (for example) talking more about the sexual proclivities of historical figures than the actual impact on society those historical figures made.  Some advice: Looking at the arguments of both sides is the way you win arguments. You went straight for the liberal articles smearing the people I listed because you believed I was wrong from the get-go, yet what has that gained you? You didn't even get upvoted except for one I gave you, so all you've done is waste your own time trying to prove something you know absolutely nothing about.

t3_69hqoj	t1_dh6plmv	1494025185	I think Trump has had some good lawyers and consultants for a long time. It is what rich businesses do. For example, printing companies who do ads and such hire my dad (an environmental consultant) to make sure they are just within the realm of compliance with OSHA and related agencies. They will actually trust my dad to decide whether breaking the law for another year is more profitable than complying that year. As long as they're within the ballpark and pay all their fines, they are in compliance. See, they can get away with not fixing the problems a few times before facing serious consequences *as long as they keep filing and keep paying the fines*.  &amp;nbsp;  I imagine Trump has a similar thing going. Like yeah, he's probably done borderline illegal and illegal stuff, but nothing some fines won't take care of. If he did something even really bad but gets off the hook with IRS-- or if financial experts SAY it's not a big deal-- all the pundits will be parroting "see it's no big deal.

t3_69431w	t1_dh6ppoe	1494025349	How is allowing homosexuals the same rights as heterosexuals to marry the person they love going to make 90 different forms of marriage? Unless you're assuming gay marriage is somehow substantially different from straight marriage even though the government handles them as the exact same thing. You might as well argue that interracial marriages would result in 90 different forms of marriage. As for benefits to society, there are measured results to people getting married, people tend to stop moving (which cuts down on paperwork the gov has to do to keep track of everyone) and they tend to live safer. Hell, I'm pretty sure insurance companies recognize this and give you a discount for being married.   As for not wanting to spend tax dollars on political agendas. That might very well be the most bullshit thing I've ever heard. literally every thing a tax dollar goes to is tied to a political agenda, the very act of taxing money and using it to do things is a political action.   Some advice: If you're going to accuse me of going straight for liberal articles smearing people you like, first make sure that I went to articles.

t3_69eepm	t1_dh6qa9m	1494026198	&gt; i actually lived it, but... whatever.  And how do you know I haven't?  lol  Either way, it doesn't change the truth value of either of our arguments and as such is  irrelevant.  &gt; are you talking about lobbyists or are you talking about the rabid tea party base that wants to burn down the country?  I said it was the people who are *paying* Ryan and the Freedom Caucus so that would be neither.  I was thinking of the Koch brothers specifically in this case, and others like them generally.   &gt; back when i could believe that politicians were in office to support and represent their constituents, i'd agree with you. these days once they get in office they don't give a shit about the public,   Being in a very red state in the South, I'm quite aware that politicians don't give a shit about their constituents.  &gt; they're just there to line their own pockets.  And if they want to keep lining their own pockets, they'd want to be re-elected.  Koch money for their re-election campaign means shit to a politician if their constituents are so pissed they won't vote for him/her.  &gt; yes, and you misphrased the second part. i think he's corrupt enough to NOT let a medicare for all vote go to the floor, because he's of the mind that the government shouldn't be providing benefits to anyone.  I didn't misphrase.  I'm aware of Ryan's ridiculous love of Ayn Rand.  I'm comparing the following:  In one case he'd go against his own principles by causing unnecessary deaths to get money for re-election.  In the other case he'd go against his own principles by giving government aid to people he doesn't think deserve it to get votes for re-election.  I agree with you that he is corrupt.  So corrupt in fact, that if he really felt it came down to it, he'd allow the bill to be introduced in order to gain re-election.  &gt; with a competent, politically-experienced president, i'd agree with you.  This made me lol because I think the same, but opposite.  I don't think a politically-experienced president would fire someone for disagreeing with him.  &gt;  i think you're ascribing far more political savvy to trump than he actually has.  No, it's not that.  Trump is a dumbass.  But we are talking about whether or not Trump could actually get Medicare for all *if he wanted to*.  I realize that probably wouldn't happen, but if the condition were met of Trump for whatever reason wanting to implement Medicare for all, I think it would be possible for him to do that.  That is my point.  &gt; i think at the heart of it all, trump doesn't care about pence's agenda because pence is focused on christian sharia law.   I agree.  But if Trump wanted anything badly and he crossed him, Pence would come to regret it.  Trump is a narcissist.  One of the hallmarks of narcissism is their capacity for revenge if their ego is damaged.  His own VP disagreeing with him on something he truly wants or further, actively working to make sure he doesn't get it, with the eyes of the entire country watching no less, would do enormous damage to Trump's ego.   &gt; trump isn't leading anything. the GOP agenda is leading, trump is rubber stamping and rubber necking.

Billingslea knew Flynn would be speaking to Kislyak, according to two former Obama administration officials, and seemed concerned Flynn did not fully understand he was dealing with a man rumored to have ties to Russian intelligence agencies.

t3_69431w	t1_dh6s6in	1494029002	&gt;As for benefits to society, there are measured results to people getting married, people tend to stop moving (which cuts down on paperwork the gov has to do to keep track of everyone) and they tend to live safer.  Agreed! So get government out of it (as in, remove "marriage" as a government institution). You get all the same benefits, but without the inequality of taxing gays/transexuals/etc for something they cannot participate. What about single people? Are they supposed to pay for married peoples' benefits too? Government has destroyed marriage by providing benefits to doing something that should only be done through love and/or mutual ambition. I wouldn't wish this on gays any more than I wish it on straights.  &gt;As for not wanting to spend tax dollars on political agendas.  "Political agenda" regarding universities, aka what we were talking about. With that said, I don't want tax dollars spent on political agendas. Personally I think the government should stop changing, and instead just provide equal opportunity for all through pure equality under the law. No special rights, no affirmative action, no welfare (UBI is okay).  &gt;What I actually did was quote Shapiro word for word.  Articles, google results, whatever. *You* asked *me* for the source of his quote, so clearly you do not know his argument.

But gays and transexuals can get married. They had a whole supreme court thing and everything.  &gt;what about single people? single people don't get the same government subsadiese as married couples because being single puts you at a higher risk. Since the government has an interest in people settling down they encourage it with various rights and privileges.      &gt;Government has destroyed marriage ... except marriage hasn't been destroyed. people are still getting married and are quite happy with the experience. There are more divorces then there were decades ago, but that has more to do with women not being forced to stay in unhealthy marriages for financial reasons.      &gt;Personally I think the government should stop changing that's a pretty stupid thing to want unless you think the government is not only the best it could ever be right now, and that socioty will never change. Governments need to be able to change with their enviornment just like everything else.      &gt;You asked me for the source of his quote, so clearly you do not know his argument.   actually, I said I wanted you to pick them and show where he said it so that you wouldn't claim I was taking it out of context when i quote him verbatim.

He's pretty religious, but doesn't seem to allow it into policies other than freedom of religion, while I am not religious at all.  &gt;that as people gain more education they become more progressive  This is due to a holier-than-thou attitude, where as people gain more education, their ego grows as they turn into "intellectuals", believing they can solve all ills of the world with their righteous morality.

t3_69eepm	t1_dh6uzf6	1494033241	&gt; right. those are the ones i label under "lobbyist".  Technically anyone who calls or writes their elected official is a lobbyist, so the Kochs could be called lobbyists.  I figured by lobbyist you meant those in the profession of lobbying or very high level volunteers in DC that lobby for causes.  That's the only way I've ever heard the label used, but it's a matter of semantics I guess.  &gt; and this is where gerrymandering becomes the problem. if you've carved out the 20% of the population that loves you and created a single district, you're going to get elected for life.  I used to think this too, but that is not actually the case.  Say there are 5 districts in a state.  One district will be packed with many of the Democratic voters, giving the Democratic candidate a 10+ point advantage over the Republican candidate in that district.  The rest of the map is shared by the Republicans, which gives each of them a 2 or 3 point advantage over their respective Democratic competitors.    So with gerrymandering their seats are almost always safe under normal circumstances.  However, if circumstances change and there is a large backlash against Republicans for not supporting Medicare for all, not only would Ryan and the members of the Freedom Caucus risk losing their seats, they'd risk a major wipe out of a lot of their Republican peers as well.  This puts even more pressure on them to cave in to public demand.  &gt; you know what, at this point i don't think that part about "causing unnecessary deaths" really is against his principles anymore.  Sadly, you may be right about this.  But either way it's still corruption since Ryan is paid to vote in a certain direction.  The Kochs even threatened to use their money against any Republican who didn't vote for the AHCA bill.  The corruption is absolutely brazen.  They don't even hide it anymore.  &gt; i will say this... it would be one HELL of an interesting show, seeing trump attempt to push single payer through the deck he's stacked against anything that benefits the people more than the oligarchs.  lol agreed!  &gt; based on his actions so far, i think what would be more likely is that trump would flip flop again, make comments of "nobody knew this was so complicated" and he'd spout off "i never said that's" and rage quit more interviews.  That is very true, but the hypothetical we were discussing is about his chances of getting Medicare for all, not if he would want it in the first place.  &gt; his ego has taken several hits already, no matter how many rallies he holds or how many times he revisits the election. and i think that's accelerating the dementia he's starting to develop.  All of this is probably true. The exception with Pence is his close proximity to Trump.

t3_69431w	t1_dh6vfss	1494033904	yeah, His arguments are just as ignorant of facts as yours were.   he claims that the only relationship a government should want is a hetersexual couple who raises children. This isn't true, not only do married couples of any combination of gender "settle down" and become more productive members of society, but homosexual couples are just as capable at raising children as heterosexual couples, either raising children from previous marriages or simply adopting children and raising them in their home.   He remarks about the rising in people having children outside of marriage as an argument against the government encouraging people to get married? That just isn't even cogent. Also, I don't think gay people are going to start having kids outside of marriage because they are now allowed to marry each other for obvious reasons.   He also thinks that allowing gay people to marry would stop people from not serving gay people. He is incorrect in this. What stops people from discriminating against gay people is the civil rights act and the constitution.   People tend to grow more conservative as they  grow older because what was once considered progressive is now horribly out of date. Your great grandpa might have patted himself for only smacking his  white daughter for looking at a black guy, but today It's backwards and insane.   I guess If I only listened to Thomas "obama is hitler" Sorwell and anti-intilletuals like Shapiro. I might think they were courteous, but when held up to people who don't get money spreading fear and ignorance you'd see why they're shunned.	KaijinDV	t1_dh6u63v

t3_69431w	t1_dh6wyux	1494036228	Society cares about having kids, because we need young people to support the old people. I personally don't know how well gay couples can raise kids or whether that has any negative or positive impacts, but gays can't have kids themselves, so pushing that institution through government is a step backward.   But that's beside the point, because every benefit you listed is accomplished without government in marriage. Since government entered into marriage and began pushing it, kids have been increasingly born out of wedlock. Like it or not, having a father figure in the household provides a sense of stability that increases success by an enormous margin. The horrid single mother population, especially in the black community, is contributing to the high unemployment rate and the increased spending on welfare despite no decreases to poverty.  What stops people from discriminating is money. People deal with shitty customers and things they disagree with all the time, but Jim Crow laws had government-mandated rules against hiring black people. The construction workers were nearly entire black in the south, and people in the north began to hire them because they were cheaper and hard working; the government stepped in and forced the construction industry to pay the prevailing wage (union wage), which priced blacks out of the industry. Capitalism is the best cure for discrimination because those who are racist are replaced by businesses that see all the free customers.   Here's a challenge: Find me a liberal speaker that takes questions, preferably on video or sound so I can do other things while listening.	grawz	t1_dh6vfss

It cares that you aren't changing jobs every 3 months, that you aren't driving recklessly, that you aren't having sex with a bunch of Randy's and complicating shit up with either STD's or just the drama having a bunch of sexual partners inevitably  bring up. Having a single romantic partner does a really good job at curtailing these habits and marriage does it even better.   As for gay couples raising kids they do just as well as heterosexual partners. The numbers say they're actually even better but that's mostly chalked up to the lack of "unwanted" children showing up in relationships not ready for it.   you seem to be arguing correlation implies causation, which is strange especially since governments have been regulating and handling marriages since the 16th century.   If you want a liberal who takes questions, I'd suggest Sam Seder. He doesn't do university tours but he does accept conservative callers to come on and discuss anything they want. He even invites top libertarian leaders onto the show to have debates (although they aren't really structured so I'd say they're more discussions) and they are hilarious.   picking one at random I've got Sam Seder and Darryl Perry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNTbvcu6OQY	KaijinDV	t1_dh6wyux

Oh, I don't think marriage through government is the only reason for its failure, but it plays a large part, especially the changes in divorce laws through the 60s. America itself hasn't handled marriage much at all until the early 1900s and usually left it up to religious institutions, so I'm not sure what you're talking about there.

t3_69i5dk	t1_dh6ytvu	1494039186	Except that Flynn was "noncommittal" about receiving the Kisleyak brief and he was provided a copy. The Kisleyak brief was requested sometime in late November. What we don't know, is specifically *when* this occurred:  &gt; The outgoing White House also became concerned about the Trump team’s handling of classified information. After learning that highly sensitive documents from a secure room at the transition’s Washington headquarters were being copied and removed from the facility, Obama’s national security team decided to only allow the transition officials to view some information at the White House, including documents on the government’s contingency plans for crises.  So did Flynn give a copy of the Kisleyak brief *to* Kisleyak? Did he reveal any of the content to him?   His didn't curtail his actions by the contents of the brief, so . . .he either disregarded the brief as unimportant and therefore didn't read it (which I kind of doubt with his mania-- he'd want to know what was in it); or he did read it and disregarded the content intentionally (since it very apparently had no influence on his behavior towards Russia).   We don't even know that the that brief wasn't what was improperly copied and removed. Would you not find it suspicious if the Kisleyak docs were of the docs smuggled out of the secure transition space?   I don't know. I'm just speculating. I wouldn't be so sure it's as above par as you suggest -- this shit keeps getting shadier by the day and I wouldn't put anything past these fucks.	the_well_hung_jury	t1_dh6xx75
t3_69431w	t1_dh6yvqu	1494039272	yeah, pretty much everything happens without government. the whole point is to encourage the action. Also, you get a tax break called filing joint taxes. you get Social security benefits, IRA benefits, legal benefits with legal council and inheritance.  Health insurance benefits, although that's not strictly governmental you do need a legal marriage licence to partake.   &gt;Oh, I don't think marriage through government is the only reason for its failure, but it plays a large part  well Shapiro disagrees with you, he only brings up government as why marriage is on the decline, although he doesn't say why. What 60's divorce laws in particular ruined marriage?   what makes you think America didn't handle marriage before the 1900's. We outlawed bigamy in 1862, and then made it a felony in 1882. Maryland banned miscegenation between blacks and philipinos (don't know why that was a problem) in 1863.

t3_69fa14	t1_dh70zbu	1494042806	To be honest, I can't think of a definitive answer. Some people I've talked to can't explain exactly what the email scandal was but say that it's proof she's a liar, others think it compromised national security and made her unfit, and still others get the private server scandal conflated with the DNC leak.   As to her responses, I do think she made a fatal error (on both DNC leak and the private server) by letting others control the narrative. Having ten surrogates go on the news and say ten different things makes it look like a coverup. Thinking that ignoring it will make it go away because "the public doesn't care" puts too much faith in the public to be fully informed on the issue (for reasons ranging from lack of time to consuming media from outlets like Breitbart who intentionally exaggerate) and too much faith in the media as a whole to properly inform the public.   So, sure, other factors contributed, but most of those factors could've been in her control if she'd sat down and given a one-hour interview to address the biggest concerns/accusations brought up about everything.	colby-klaus	t1_dh6gb5b

t3_69j9wg	t1_dh71y47	1494044463	[TIL conservatives tell blatant lies that are unsupported by facts](http://www.snopes.com/politics/politicians/warren.asp)  &gt;The Herald has twice quoted Charles Fried, the head of the Harvard appointing committee that recommended Warren for her position in 1995, saying that the Democratic candidate’s heritage didn’t come up during the course of her hiring. **“It simply played no role in the appointments process,” he said. “It was not mentioned and I didn’t mention it to the faculty.”**  &gt;The Herald later quoted Fried, a former U.S. Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan, saying, **“I can state categorically that the subject of her Native American ancestry never once was mentioned.”**  [TIL conservatives manipulate data when the facts don't directly support their claims](http://www.snopes.com/elizabeth-warren-staff-pay/)  &gt;Salary information for Senator Warren’s staff is publicly available through the Secretary of the Senate’s office, but the Free Beacon’s use of only the most recent fiscal year’s data, their exclusion of high-earning women on Senator Warren’s office staff due to narrow (and seemingly arbitrary) selection criteria, and their non-consideration of job duties and titles doesn’t support the implication that Senator Warren pays women less than men for equivalent work. At best, it shows that male staffers earned more than female staffers in Senator Warren’s office because more men occupied the top positions among her staff during a selected time frame.

t3_69431w	t1_dh72egj	1494045331	The tax breaks and benefits are part of the issue because they incentivize marriage before the couple are certain. The divorce laws were the "no fault" change, where divorce is easier and easier to obtain, giving the impression that it is less important to stay together.    &gt;well Shapiro disagrees with you, he only brings up government as why marriage is on the decline  I imagine he has some other points to make if he needed to go further, but I don't really care whether he agrees with me or not. You want me to become Shapiro, but this argument only started because you hadn't even heard of any conservative speakers yet you tried to speak on the subject.  You ask why I don't think America handled marriage before 1900, but in fact I said, "America itself hasn't handled marriage **much at all** until the early 1900s". Nothing you listed conflicts with any of my arguments. Stop trying to apply absolutes.  So I listened to most of the video you linked, but that libertarian just exploded and he seemed to advocate for anarcho-capitalism and not libertarianism, though I could have that a little wrong because I'm not sure anarcho-capitalism applies contract law and I'm too lazy to look it up. [Here is a fantastic debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of9-Y7jrzCc) between him and Peter Schiff, a pretty respected libertarian. They both interrupted a ton, though I think Schiff was worse in that regard. Pretty good arguments from both!

t3_69431w	t1_dh7754g	1494056261	Who knows how many people get married for tax breaks? You just said it makes marriage easier, so that along with the divorce laws, plus extra child tax credits, and a welfare state to support single mothers when the dad runs off all work together to create a downward trend for marriage and family.   As for pre-1900s marriage, again, it does nothing against my argument. We're speaking upon the subject of the negative impacts government has had in recent times regarding marriage, and using history as a comparison on the absence of government and the presence of government. If you have an argument for why the presence of outlawing bigamy makes a difference to this argument, great, but you're not going to gain anything by proving this point you're stuck on.  &gt;...you must be new to Libertarianism, especially online LIbertarianism.   Now you know how I feel about leftists, except they're basically all bad (true of most people I suppose). You're a great example of a leftist because you literally asked me to provide you the video of a quote you found (this is Trump-level laziness), then after I showed you the next best thing, you proceeded to nitpick Shapiro's marriage argument as though a minute and a half video was all you needed to fully understand his philosophy. And now you're spinning out on bigamy pre-1900s, all the while refusing to look at any of the speakers I listed in the first place! You posted your Milo comment,  probably not even knowing any of Milo's arguments other than a quote here and there. Sure, he's awful, but you should at least know the arguments of those you denigrate. A reasonable leftist is a fricken unicorn nowadays.  Go watch that Sam Seder vs Peter Schiff debate I linked. Schiff is an economist, while most politicians only know enough of the ideology to pass by ignorant voters.	grawz	t1_dh72sgk

Things are moving too slowly in this country, after decades Americans are still worrying about whether or not they can receive health care without going bankrupt, while other countries have already handily covered their entire population and now worry more about decreasing their emergency room wait times for non-emergencies than they do about whether or not people will receive the care they need.  We can't claim to be the greatest country in the world when we can't even care for our poor and sick. We are a global embarrassment when it comes to almost anything except our military and frankly I'm sick and tired of centrists pandering to the status quo.

There's also a very good chance that Trump's supporters don't all line up behind Pence. He can't claim to be his successor, really.

I worked in the ICU and nearly 90% of the patients were conditions that the patient set themselves up for.  COPD/respiratory failure from years of smoking, liver failure from drinking, people coding from uncontrolled diabetes from being obese, people with anoxic brain injuries from drug overdoses, people with delirium tremens from withdrawal, etc.  I know some conditions can't be prevented and some unlucky individual will get some cancer or disease that they could nothing to stop.  However, how do you respond to when a healthy person who eats right, doesn't smoke or drink, has to pay more so the obese alcoholic with dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure needs to be admitted for the 4th time in three months because he doesn't take his meds?

t3_69i52u	t1_dh7m7d1	1494089589	I appreciate your devil's advocate position. I think the best way to really hammer out an issue is to make an effort to see an issue from every side but you can catch a lot of shit for doing that.      What's the alternative here? Raise the premiums of those people so they can't possibly hope to afford treatment? Or they put off getting help early and get cripplingly ill sooner? Are you suggesting we punish people for being burdensome? Isn't that a dangerous president? Are you suggesting you need to have a net benefit to society to be deserving of health care?   Who decides when it's okay to penalize someone for a lifestyle choice? Do you penalize a man in his twenties who struggles with obesity and terrible eating habits because his family didn't give him access to a healthy diet so he's starting his independent life at a severe disadvantage? Or a chronic pain sufferer who turns to substance abuse because they're staving off a mental breakdown?  Do you think ruining these people to make an example of them will actually stop others from smoking or eating fast food?   I think the correct solution is to accept that these sick people, the consequences of their choices have occured. Thats a fact. Pulling their care doesn't actually fix anything it only causes misery.   I think that investing in public education and covering regular check ups can prevent people from living shit life styles. Which ends up being good for everyone. And I agree that alcohol, fast food, and cigarettes should be taxed to cover PSAs and subsidize the fallout care.   I think we should recognize that we seem to have a hard on for like "justice served" even to the detriment of the bigger picture.   I'm clearly a crazy left wing idealist. Tho' so...

If you boycott because you don't see eye to eye with them, you are probably going to be boycotting a lot of things.  EDIT: I see you are a Seahawks fan. Why support the NFL, especially after what Kaepernick did? Why support them after a Seahawks player knelt for the anthem last year? I am willing to bet that you didn't support that.

Donald Trump: **"Nobody knew health care could be so complicated."**  He also said healthcare would be "so easy". Trump doesn't have an analysis of the problem, and he doesn't want a solution. He's just parroting people's legitimate concerns as bait for his own billionaire policies.	white_nation	t1_dh7rg73

t3_69mn8q	t1_dh7s9as	1494097924	Seriously, to still be saying they are similar is kind of insane. Trump knows what people want to hear and he says it. And keeps saying it. Then he does the complete opposite of that when it comes time to actually do it.  Trump says it right to his supporters. After he won he had that rally where he told his supporters about draining the swamp and how when one advisor brought that rally cry up during the campaign he thought it was hokey and stupid. Then he said it during one rally and people loved it so said he figured he'd keep going with it.	MetHead7	t1_dh7s1hg
t3_69mn8q	t1_dh7sd7e	1494098079	What establishment is Trump a threat to? He's gone strictly by the Republican playbook on every issue.

t3_69mn8q	t1_dh7sxrj	1494098875	While I don't disagree with the point that Sanders is **part** of the reason why the Democratic Party didn't unite behind Hillary, this is not "enabling" Trump. Sanders is using Trump's own foot-in-mouth moment to promote the exact same agenda he has always had. If you recall, healthcare was one of the biggest points of conflict between him and Hillary in the primary debates, as he was always in favor of a single-payer healthcare system over the ACA.  It also seems clear to me that he's using this as an opportunity to take a jab at Trump. Sanders knows well that his agenda is antithetical to that of Trump supporters, so his publicly supporting a statement of Trump will, if anything, drive a wedge between Trump and his base (i.e. "Trump said something that Bernie Sanders thinks is right? He must not be doing what I voted him in for.")  Essentially from the left this statement is nothing more than saying "Even a broken clock is right twice a day!" but from the right, hopefully a few will take away the message that the clock actually is broken.	cmetz90	t1_dh7sheq
t3_69mn8q	t1_dh7szym	1494098960	&gt; Trump knows what people want to hear and he says it.

t3_69j9wg	t1_dh7xz12	1494106073	Nobody is saying run as her a "woman" candidate. When men run, they're not "male" candidates. They're just candidates. *If* (because I think she has said that she doesn't want to run, and damn do we need her in the Senate, and she is aware of that) she runs in 2020, she'll just be a candidate. And if she's elected, then yes...she'll be the first female president. Just like Obama was the first black president, but wasn't just a "black" candidate. But to immediately jump to "oh no, don't run her as a *woman* candidate" is kind of bogus because she...is a woman. A very qualified woman, who could do great things in the White House. Maybe I'm misreading it, but it seems like you're the one who's knee-jerk reacting to her gender, when it doesn't matter, right? A qualified person is a qualified person, and Warren is more than qualified.   And Clinton was qualified too, by virtue of her experience in the political realm. Did she have issues as a candidate? Yes. But to say that her entire campaign was "this is a woman!" is ridiculous, and what the GOP was really trying to drill into people's heads.	unhampered_by_pants	t1_dh7tmyd

Senators make decisions that affect billions of people and get paid only $170k... if anything they should be paid significantly more, not less.  Also, as others have pointed out, most of those screwing over the poor are rich far beyond their official salary, and reducing it would leave it impossible for someone not wealthy beforehand (and thus more likely to screw poor people) to afford to work in Congress.

His fans are there, but not the beautiful people whose approval he so desperately desires deep inside. He hears his aides arguing in the next room. He rubs his head and reaches for his twitter. He sees #TakeTheDeal trending, and being sent to him via DM. A crowd funding site has broken over 100 Million dollars pledged in return for his immediate resignation. 100 Million. He dismisses it. Days go by, 100, 175, 300. Then it hits the number. 1 billion. 1.8 billion. Whatever it is, the number gets high enough and his job satisfaction gets low enough- and he takes the money. He settles his debt and starts some sort of news service- telling the DC Elites they are suckers. He loves the idea of taking the money from crying liberals, and his supporters love him for it. They understand the broken system isn't his fault- and can't wait for him to use that money to fight the good fight.

But a lot of people still do not obtain insurance, mostly because they cannot afford it.  This is particularly true in states that refuse to accept ACA money to expand medicaid coverage to higher income groups.  In every state there is a band of people that make too much money for medicaid, but not enough money to pay for regular insurance (even with ACA subsidy).  People pay rent and buy food (and cigarettes etc.) before they buy health insurance.  When a government guarantees universal coverage, all the medical bills go to the government.  and 100% of people are covered.	vtjohnhurt	t1_dh82lbx

The first US combat casualty since 1993, since Black Hawk down, he was killed yesterday. Also within the past week, two Army Rangers were also killed fighting in eastern Afghanistan. Also within the past week an Army Paratrooper was killed on patrol outside Mosul where the Trump administration has quietly and without announcements been sending more and more and more US troops. Next week the top US commander in Afghanistan is going to ask for thousands more US troops to be sent into Afghanistan once again.  &gt;There is precisely one confirmed Pentagon nominee. Secretary of Defense. That's it. There are 58 confirmable nominees in the Pentagon - they haven't filled 57 of them. It's not that they're putting forward nominees and they're getting blocked. They haven't even made any nominations for almost any of these jobs, the open Senior Defense and National Security jobs in the entire government.	delafayette	t3_69oe4o

Blocking coal is a smart move because it impacts Trump states without impacting other regions or industries and without escalating things too far.  It's clear that Trump doesn't publicly back down from his pronouncements, but with a little backroom dealing that gives him wiggle room with a route to claim victory, no matter how hollow it is, he will often walk back from what he says.  We've seen it with China, we've seen it with NATO and we've seen it with Germany.  You don't confront and escalate a situation with Trump publicly because then he feels obligated to respond in a tough guy way that's good for ratings.  Trudeau has a background working with children. I doubt he ever thought he'd need to fall back on it once he moved to Ottawa, but there you go. This needs to be handled with tact, that's all.	maybelying	t1_dh83jxa

There are a few ways that they can try to trip you up in that situation where most people will fall for it almost automatically. If that happens I wouldn't be surprised if you're looking at charges for providing false information and disobeying a police officer...  I wish I were kidding, I'm not...  For example:  You and a friend get stopped and he has a warrant/OUI/suspended/etc. Cop may ask you for your ID just out of curiosity (you don't have to give it to them). At that point you may get nervous and say that you don't have any ID on you. Cop goes back to run your buddy's ID...  Comes back and states that they have to impound your car (they do) and then you state out loud that "I can drive it back" or something like that because you freaked out about being stranded...  Cop is now confused. You *just* said you couldn't produce ID, but yet you say you can drive? How's that work? Now you're stumbling over your words and seem suspicious, now they have probable cause to run your ID. If you have it on your person or in the car, you're about to be in for a lot of uncomfortable questions if the cop doesn't like you...  Just saying, there are ways they dance around these situations...	fc_w00t	t1_dh841s4

"I am not a nationalist, I am not a protectionist – if you were going to take a very protectionist trend, our whole economy is so importantly tied to yours, we'd have to make some very fundamental decisions," Trudeau says.

His birth was preceded by the death of two brothers, Viktor and Albert, born in the mid-1930s. Albert died in infancy and Viktor died of diphtheria during the Siege of Leningrad in World War II.[28] Putin's mother was a factory worker and his father was a conscript in the Soviet Navy, serving in the submarine fleet in the early 1930s. Early in World War II, his father served in the destruction battalion of the NKVD.[29][30][31] Later, he was transferred to the regular army and was severely wounded in 1942.[32] Putin's maternal grandmother was killed by the German occupiers of Tver region in 1941, and his maternal uncles disappeared at the war front.[33]	pizzashill	t1_dh86aoq

There has been a veritable flood of t_d denizens into these comment threads, insisting that Colbert need to be fired for being a homophobic bigot, and they vanish the moment it's pointed out that they're personally opposed to gay marriage, and that their supposed concerns about Colbert come off as concern trolling.  If you support rights for LGBTQ people and aren't a Trump supporter, then I'm happy to discuss the very real cultural issues around sex and sexuality that Colbert's joke reflects, but I don't think it's honest to call the joke homophobic, especially in light of the fact that it (or a slight variant) works equally well with any combination of genders.	kescusay	t1_dh8e15l

t3_69pe9f	t1_dh8f3h6	1494133013	On the off-chance you're *not* trolling, it should be painfully obvious that the act itself is not being mocked. What makes Colbert's joke funny is the juxtaposition of the submissive nature of the act of putting a dick in one's mouth to Trump's position as a *leader*, a position which one would expect to be dominant. As others pointed out to you, the genders could be reversed or alternated and the joke would still be relevant in context.	SquirrelDragon	t1_dh8eoo7
t3_69pe9f	t1_dh8f3ze	1494133042	Its punching up and down, comedy is time plus pain; when comedy is against the powerful time is shorter due to the scale of differences.  Punching down:  Milo's recent jokes toward the trans community being perverts is punching down onto a small percent of an audience while he being in the "empowered" position on the stage with the microphone.  When Trump attacked the journalist with a disability, Trump is a "healthy," "multimillionaire" with a hundred of supporters in a stadium insulting one man by name and further insulting him not by the quality of the journalist's writing but by the physical state of the journalist.  Punching Up:  Colbert is punching up by insulating that Trump exists only for Putin's pleasure. Colbert may be a millionaire TV host with multiple fans but hes attacking/insulting a President and the President's lacking policy; the President is far more "powerful" than a TV host. Colbert's joke is not targeting homosexuals it targeting the President; Colbert is suggesting Trump is Putin's lover and thus would happily preform oral stimulation. Colbert is not suggesting the wrongness in wanting to orally stimulate your lover only suggesting it is wrong for the President of the United States to stimulate the dictator of a foreign power.  TL;DR: No one will find you kicking your cat funny, but people will find your cat jumping on your face funny while no one will find a tiger jumping on your face funny.	statistically_viable	t1_dh8ecb9

Liberals eviscerate Republicans who make those kinds of comments, but band together to defend those kinds of statements when it's one of their own. It happened a lot when Obama was in power. Republicans saying incredibly stupid things.  It isn't a matter of up or down. It's Left or Right.  EDIT: I'm not saying what Colbert said is right or wrong, okay or not okay.

A joke above all else needs to be funny and good witted to make other people laugh and thus considered comedy. If you just want to inflame people and then be prepared to be frustrated if no one laughs at your jokes and don't expect people to forgive you under the umbrella of comedy.  A "cis white hetro male conservative" could go onto a stage and only tell jokes about "the gays," "the liberals," "the jews" and "the blacks" all night and make people of all backgrounds and cultures laugh but only if the jokes are well written and well preformed. If what you call jokes are not funny then people won't consider them jokes.

Colbert prefaced the whole thing with the "President" insulting his colleague - to his face - on a major interview. "DEface the Nation is what I call it."    Why the fuck would he go on an interview where he knows he's going to be asked questions he *has* to run away from? I submit that he did it to drop that little Donnie Quip, which failed miserably. And now his little feelings are hurt because Colbert is wittier, carries **MORE** influence than the President?   Please. I hope Colbert laughs in their faces.	Beard_o_Bees	t1_dh8f48c

I get that Berkshire Hathaway does business in Texas. However, even if a company is a "person" and money = "free speech" (thanks, Citizens United), why does Berkshire Hathaway get a say or influence in how an election works out in another state? If I'm a man living in Colorado, I don't get any influence or say-so in how people in New Hampshire elect their representatives. The people living there should be the only ones that get to influence their own elections. This stuff makes no sense. Supposedly, I and Berkshire Hathaway are both "people," and should have an equal vote and equal voice. But it seems like this corporation has a hell of a lot more power and a much louder voice than I do. This is, of course, only one example. Amplify this by however many hundreds of thousands of companies there are in America and you've got the makings of a serious problem.  How did we get here, America?

t3_69qmt6	t1_dh8ocep	1494158767	It still does NOT mean that France has an alt-right problem- at least not the way the American media portrays it.  &gt; The fact that the alt-rights on boards like T_D and 4chan are rallying behind her should be the first clue.  Firstly, T_D and 4chan are fully of teenagers or delusional people who are mostly Americans. France has better high school education, and much cheaper universities, so the country is better educated than Americans. Moreover, T_D does not represent French alt-rightism, and you are wrong in equating both of them. &gt; Le Pen is alt-right.   Secondly, the French presidential system is completely different to that of the US.

t3_69rbr3	t1_dh8r95b	1494164910	&gt; No one ever quite explains how even the most idealistic of Democrats could “reach out” to the 61 percent of Trump primary voters who believe that Barack Obama is an illegal immigrant born in Kenya and smuggled through customs as part of a Manchurian candidate conspiracy, but liberals will maintain that a large number of racists voting for a racist is somehow their fault.  &gt; Progressives were too “politically correct” or “self-righteous,” as a former Obama official phrased it for the Atlantic, and they are incapable of seeing beyond the “blue bubble,” to cite a boring bromide forever playing on repeat in television studios and radio stations across America.  This is the nut and a good point: you don't solve racism by appeasing it. We need to do a better job of showing the white working class what we can do for them.

We are a conservative nation we have been forever (small incremental socialist changes have been the norm), the democratic party of today is not that much different than Bill Clinton's third way.  You either need to inspire white middle america or coddle them, but something needs to be done for the democrats to start winning again.  This article has no solutions just complaints.

t3_69rbr3	t1_dh8rj8c	1494165835	&gt; I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season." Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.  &gt; I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.  -- Martin Luther King, Jr.    From "Letter from a Birmingham Jail."

t3_69rbr3	t1_dh8rv5o	1494166628	&gt; But if that means we throw the rest of the working class under the bus, what's the point of winning?  That's not the point.  The point is that we spend too much time in campaigns talking about identity issues that are only relevant to a narrow slice of the population.    When Barack Obama ran for President and got 70 million votes, you never heard him talk about how great it was going to be to elect a black President.  You never heard him say that McCain was a racist, sexist bigot.  He spent his time talking about bringing competent government back to Washington, and enacting popular economic and foreign policy goals -- his policy had no color or gender.    When you're speaking as a candidate -- especially as a Presidential candidate -- every sentence is vital oxygen.  When you're speaking to an issue that's only relevant to 20% of the population, then you're wasting a chance to reach out to 100% of voters.  That's not to say you should only speak about these broad issues that affect all Americans.  But you can talk about more narrow issues in unifying terms that help the 100% see why it's important to think about this 5, 10, 20% issue.  Help the 100% see how they can be part of a solution, rather than just making them feel bad about the problem.  And you know what??  Even *racists* will vote for a black candidate when you do this right.  This shit was elementary school politics back in 2008.  I don't know how we fell so far back that we need this remedial course 8 years later.	anon902503	t1_dh8r95b

Stupid as fuck imo. But it worked. If you were a white male who was working 70 hours a week just to keep the lights on, and you were being told by the party you voted for that you were a privileged white male and your problems don't matter. You probably switched over. And it has had disastrous consequences.	PopeyeJonesesBigHead	t1_dh8rci9
t3_69qmt6	t1_dh8tava	1494168958	My point exactly. I didn't have to scroll very far in his profile to see that he hates Muslims, women, and African Americans.

t3_69rbr3	t1_dh8try0	1494169687	I don't disagree with that in broad terms.  White people make up 60% of the country and 70% of the voting electorate.  Minorities are called minorities for a reason, they lack the political power to enact political change on their own.    You wanna start a debate about how identity politics that seeks to not just celebrate a certain identity, but to place blame and create an "us vs. them" dynamic can be destructive and counter-productive?  I'll join with you on that side of the debate, so long as your condemnation of these types of identity politics includes the right's scapegoating of immigrants, feminists, and LGBT people alongside your condemnation of the left's scapegoating of straight white males.  You wanna talk about how the left should re-frame minority issues in order to better appeal to white people, or even de-emphasize them a bit when campaigning?  So long as minorities aren't left out when the legislative sausage gets made (as too often happens), I'll be on your side on that.

t3_69qmt6	t1_dh8wwev	1494174117	They weren't *all* socialists.   The Nazi party was internally divided into several camps. A large section of it, mostly concentrated in Northern Germany were hard socialist/nationalists, led by Goebels and Strasser. This was also the hotbed of the Brownshirts, the SA, who sought to replace the current army with a people's army led by them. They drew a lot of their strength from Berlin (Goebbel's was its Gauleiter) which had traditionally been a socialist and communist hotbed. A lot of their members were former socialist or communist party members (just like Mussolini), who left because of the perceived betrayal of 1918. Their view of Nazism was quite close to Stalin's militant communism, with a strong focus on the mass mobilization of the entire state through the embracing of an all encompassing national ideology focused on the local people's that would sweep aside all of the existing elite in an atmosphere of constant internal and external combat.  The other camp, a bit weaker in numbers, but probably stronger in support from the rest of the population, where the Italian style corporatist Nazis, the camp that Hitler led. They had a stronger focus on coopting existing institutions and were well funded by the Southern German industrial and agricultural concerns, who saw them as an ally in breaking German labor and fighting back against Social and Christian democrat attempts to reform Germany. This view of National Socialism was a more oligarchic view where the nation's will flowed through a fairly traditional elite in an atmosphere of traditional values reforged in a brutal mindset of continual conquest.  Many Nazis expected a total revolution of society, with Jewish finance and business being just as high on their enemies list as Jewish Bolshevism. Many of the brownshirts did expect a true socialist state. This is why the Rohm push and the night of the long knives happened (among other factors), Hitler was cleaning house of powerful men who were somewhat disillusioned with his cosying up to the large industrial concerns and the army.

t3_69qmt6	t1_dh8y7vl	1494175898	Unfortunately, it isn't.  News outlets here (Europe) report that the turnout is at a historical low. If Le Pen is defeated that would be great news but I'm not really convinced that Macron is the solution. Although he offers some alternatives for the present political course (he advocated debt restructuring for Greece, said he would support reform within the EU, ...) he'll need the support of mainstream parties for this, otherwise it'll just be "business as usual" and we'll be in the exact same situation next time around.   A large part of the populace in Europe (and the USA) has become disillusioned in the present economic and political course. Unless something is done to give these people a way to participate constructively in politics and the economy is reoriented to serve society as a whole they will eventually lose faith in the institutions of the state and democratic process as a whole.  Unless something is done to fix the underlying causes for this resurgence of the authoritarian and xenophobe right , it will continue to be a threat. At the very last this would mean overhauling our economic system, stabilizing the middle east, pushing up the living standard in Africa and combating climate change (to prevent even more migrations and wars). I personally hope that current supranational institutions like the EU and the UN remain intact for the coming years, even if they have considerable faults, because individual EU members are too small to do much about it.	barryvm	t3_69qmt6

My Grandmother was in La Resistance, one Grandfather in the Free French, and my other Grandfather was in the Army. My Grandmother smuggled her children, then herself to the US, and the Free French hit Paris with the Normandie invasion, and then rather than return to France afterward, they settled in the US. They lost everything and never stopped fighting.  In the process, they'd been the greatest ally the US has ever known, and the greatest friends. When we erred, they told us. When we were doing the right thing, they joined us. Remember "Freedom Fries?" That was when France told the US in no uncertain terms that Iraq was a mistake. And it was. We didn't believe them.  ~~Our democracy is based on that of the French Republic after the Thermidor reaction, France's revolution AFTER the French Revolution.~~ Over the centuries, we've kinda made a mess of democracy, but we can fix it.

I have looked at your speakers and I've given reasons why they are unreasonable, unless you believe comparing Obama to Hitler over BP disaster relief and ranting about the homosexual agenda is reasonable.   the pre-1900's laws on marriage weren't there to refute your claim of the negative impacts of government for marriage in "recent times". It was to refute your claim that the government wasn't in the business of marriage before the 1960's.   If you want my opinion on the increase in divorces over the last half dozen decades. It has more to do with woman's liberation then tax benefits. Woman are no longer financially and socially tied to their husband. So when in an abusive relationships less women are forced to stick around. Rising healthcosts and a hindered wage has also hurt the institution of marriage. If you'd recall in a previous post I pointed out that money concerns are the #1 cause for divorce and healthcare bills are the #1 cause of bankruptcies.

Systems like the NHS in Great Britain essentially strike the bargain that the middle class gets worse care than it ordinarily would in exchange for the poor getting better care than they ordinarily would - while the rich and politically connected get world-class care far better than either.  That's why you see a great deal of the enthusiasm for 'single payer health care' go out of people as they move from being impoverished students to stable, professional adults.

The people who receive union/employer-paid health insurance are a large swathe of middle income Americans who really, really don't want their health care downgraded so that some poor people they don't know can have regular dental appointments.  They've already got a 'single payer' for their health care - but their 'single payer' is much, much better than any deal the government can offer.  So what are you offering them?  That they should just suck it up, foot the bill and accept inferior care?	ViskerRatio	t1_dh9c1pi

Because in their theology, God shows his favor by giving wealth to the chosen, and poverty to the cast out and therefore sinful.	Puffin_fan	t3_69ttr7
t3_69ttr7	t1_dh9com3	1494194353	&gt; They've already got a 'single payer' for their health care - but their 'single payer' is much, much better than any deal the government can offer.  In case you haven't realized things are getting worse. When I was a kid in the 90s it was no copay for most plans to see a primary care doc. Recently I got charged the full price ($128) because the employer plan won't pay until the deductible is met. And I have one of the good ones where the deductible is only $300.  &gt; So what are you offering them?  Transition to a regulated market for insurance like switzerland. The ACA, with a few tweaks, can be a great tool for making this happen. Instead of your employer self-insuring (most large companies self insure) they fork over that subsidy (in my case 4k a year) for you to buy a plan on the market. Self employed people and people whose employers don't offer a subsidy get one from the government. It's efficient, equitable, and market based so people who want better insurance have to pay for it. Instead of our current system of ~16,000 different payers for insurance each with their own rules.	cantconsternthe_bern	t1_dh9cd9v
t3_69ttr7	t1_dh9cq7z	1494194409	People who don't need expensive treatments generally don't go out and get expensive treatments. There isn't just a limitless supply of healthcare to give out to all the people who need it. I wish there was, but there isn't. We already have taxpayer funded emergency rooms where if someone is truly in dire condition they're treated.   The reality is we have to pick 2 out of 3 of the following with healthcare: 1. universality;  2. affordability; and 3. quality. We can either have:  - Universal coverage thats affordable, but bad quality; or  - Universal coverage that's high quality, but will bankrupt the country; or  - Quality healthcare that's affordable, but not universal  There are no other options. I think conservatives are far more realistic about this issue than liberals. We choose option 3. Liberals claim they can achieve all 3. There is no historical or theoretical evidence to suggest this is possible.	JerryReese	t1_dh9c4jy
t3_69ttr7	t1_dh9crdr	1494194448	I am pretty left-leaning and definitely pro 'socialized' universal coverage, but I also think that healthcare should not be discussed in terms of human rights.   My reasoning is this: Human rights are universal and do not depend on technology; healthcare (as we understand it) depends on technology; thus healthcare does not fall under human rights. - Human rights must be the same for us today as they had been for the primitive homo sapiens 50.000 years ago, by the very meaning of the term "*human* rights." But we have a hard time imagining what a right to healthcare might have looked like in a primitive society.  Equal access to affordable healthcare is a basic element of human solidarity, at least within a society. What the Republicans just did was to deny the social contract and reject the very concept of solidarity within a society. In short: "Fuck you, I got mine." (But it technically is not a violation of human rights.)    Edit: But I think this is a technicality and does not matter much.	MonkeyWrench3000	t1_dh9auc3

t3_69ttr7	t1_dh9cul4	1494194564	Let's assume you are correct. You can ration healthcare at the source by time-rationing (long lines) rather than price rationing (cutting off the poor.)   Countries like Canada, Australia and UK all use the time-rationing method to serve ALL their citizens regardless of risk pools, pre-existing conditions etc., and while it does lead to longer lines for optional services like ACL surgeries, it ensures no ones life is lost just because they were poor.  TLDR: Even if you buy the rationing argument, that is no reason to avoid single payer systems.	thedabking123	t1_dh9b7ct

t3_69ttr7	t1_dh9dbdc	1494195163	&gt; it ensures no ones life is lost just because they were poor.  True, but it ensures that people's lives *are* lost due to wait-times on treatment. Rationing is rationing. In the words of Van Jones, you can't polish that turd.	JerryReese	t1_dh9cul4
t3_69ttr7	t1_dh9dbiy	1494195168	While this is technically true, the terms "affordable" and "quality" can be stretched pretty far, given how *cheap* complex medical achievements *can* be. Many European countries like Germany, France and Switzerland have high-quality, affordable and universal healthcare. Everyone gets what they need, but *technically* it is not the best quality theoretically imaginable: If you have lost your legs, the insurance company will pay you a wheelchair or a couple of prosthetic legs, but not a million-dollar exoskeleton prototype; if you are 95 years old and diagnosed with a slow-moving, terminal disease that will probably lead to your death within the next 20 years, then the insurance company and the doctors will probably delay treatment for a bit and just 'see what happens'.

Seeing what's happening to republican leadership (recusals, exiting, legislative failings etc..) the Democrats are circling their prey. The problem with establishment Dems is there are no recognizable names to forward a message. Especially that Sanders is marching around the country (with Perez) with a message they are not behind. So out comes Hillary. I don't believe that Hilliary and her team solely blame her loss on the emails and Comey but she's the only thing the establishment had banked on for the next 8 years. Trump started a populist fervor of support  that he is systematically dismantling which Dems are confused about. This used to be how they got elected but they swore that off when the bankrolls started to swell. There are some hard choices the Dems are going to have to make in the near future. That is, if they want to win.	janzeera	t1_dh9f81v

The problem is there is too much money involved and too many politicians both D and R with their hand in that cookie jar.

There are needs that should be provided by a government, but they don't even do those well. As an example, Bill and Melinda Gates have done more to help Africa compared to our government and at micro-pennies on the dollar. Not saying Gates should supply health care, since I know your brain already went there. You should get the point.  Look at the amazing results of the x prize, another example.

t3_69ttr7	t1_dh9i1ap	1494201692	Sorry but you're wrong. My brother has lived in London for 20 years. His employer provides supplemental insurance because the state insurance isn't the greatest. It's real good for basic and routine care but anything beyond that requires months of waiting. At least twice he traveled to the US and paid cash for treatment he had been waiting for more than 6 months for in the UK.   "More than 92% of French residents have complementary private insurance.” This insurance pays for additional fees in order to access higher quality providers."  "French doctors are paid by the national health insurance system based on a centrally planned fee schedule, but doctors can charge whatever price they want. The patient–or their private insurance–must make up the difference between the fee charged by the doctor and the amount paid for by the universal health care system."  "The program is threatened by increasing costs and may be forced to resort to rationing in the future.”   There is no system that works perfectly nor will a mandate and piles of government money fix ours.

t3_69vdaq	t1_dh9ou53	1494211298	As a dude living in rural America, you're right on some points.  Jobs are few and far between, though the children usually stay near unless they've underwent schooling for a lucrative career. Usually it's more likely that they went to trade school (electrician, HVAC, welding, etc.) and they stay in the same town, or at least county. They then tend to join unions, and then vote for Republicans because their parents always have and that's all the further most look into politics. When I point out to them that Republicans have been union busting assholes for a long time, they just...don't believe it, because they still have a union to be in, so it must be a lie.  Small businesses can usually last a few years, but that's about it. In the current climate (I worked for a small business and have known the owner since I was 5.) they're all being squeezed to death for the most part. This one in particular has been around for over a century. Pretty much on the verge of shutting down, or being sold (a pharmacy, so insurance companies and their abysmal reimbursement rates are to do with this example.)  It sucks, and nobody has an answer. So the answer they went with was "elect the idiot that has no idea what he's doing, because literally anything else is better than what's happening to us now"  Instead of get more involved it was "vote for the billionaire, surely he'll look after the little guy, despite his long history of failing ventures and broken contracts!"

There was a major shift in china starting with the cultural revolution in the mid 1970s. You saying that they are communist shows a complete lack of understanding as to what communism is. Without giving you a 2 hour sociology lecture, the most basic principle of communism is all being equal.  There is no private property ownership, no business ownership. All is owned and run by the state in an effort to rid society of the differentiation between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. One glance at a Google image of Hong Kong or Bejing should be enough to show your belief to be false.   The examples of China being more capitalist than communist are too numerous to mention. Going forward, I recommend you read up on the subject of communism lest you look like one of those idiots in Starbucks on his iPad wearing a Che Guevara tee shirt because he thinks communists are cool.  I'd love to airdrop those folks into north Korea and a year later, ask them what they think of communism now.  Should I do a gofundme for that?	Pliskin1999	t1_dh9mt7z

Economics is fucking complicated, how many Americans do you think could tell you what Keynesian economics is?  2nd point: That's a bit of a disingenuous way to interpret that poll, no? At this point it's widely held knowledge that Bush was warned about Bin Laden, and seemingly chose not properly handle that warning. While I would argue that the stupid "Bush did 9/11" crap is nonsense, they could have handled that situation much better.  3rd point: A large fraction. Well that's a bit vague, no? Gonna have to ask for a source if you're that vague. The pay gap is not the same as what's stated commonly, no. It's vastly oversimplified.  4th point: 6 million is chump change.  So, to sum up. These are all either complex issues that the average American won't know about, dishonestly interpreted, one point I'm willing to concede (possibly, if you can actually prove it) and another that's literally a very minor blip in money when you consider the population of our country.

Land ownership is a valid communist principle but as I stated, there are exceptions. Later in the article, it points out the obvious "The irony is that the Communist leadership structure is geared toward capitalist ends." This is my point.   Since this is a thread on health care, you may be intrigued to know that 10 years ago, only about 20% of rural Chinese had any health care at all. Not very communist, wouldn't you say?

t3_69x8kg	t1_dha19fe	1494238611	It is surprisingly difficult to estimate levels of voter turnout by race. Unlike the forthcoming report from the Current Population Survey, Catalist’s estimates are based not on self reports but on actual turnout records. Since most states do not ask voters about their racial/ethnic background, Catalist usually estimates this information from the voter’s name and neighborhood.  According to recent research, Catalist correctly predicts race/ethnicity about 91 percent of the time. Further, we use Catalist’s estimates of voter race for both 2012 and 2016. If Catalist’s estimates are wrong, they’re likely wrong in a consistent way — and so any differences we find in the electorate’s racial composition are accurate.  The denominator we use to calculate turnout rates is an estimate of the citizen voting-age population (CVAP) by race in November 2012 and November 2016, respectively. To construct this estimate, we use the Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Program data to calculate the voting-age population in each state by race, and then use American Communities Survey information on citizenship rates to remove the (often substantial) noncitizen population for each racial/ethnic group.

The question is "who is going to pay for the upgrade?". Ultimately, it will be the end-user (you and I) who pays for it. The net-neutrality fight is simply an argument on who passes the expense on to the consumer: Will the ISPs raise your access rates to cover the cost, or will Netflix/Google/Reddit/etc raise/begin charging monthly subscription rates (or will both sides punt it to the American taxpayer to deal with)?

You have the payments set to an automatic deposit so he gets it regardless of whether he shows up to do the job. A few weeks go by and your lawn is looking ragged and long, the city is calling you to go mow it, and your lawn guy is now saying he doesn't have the money or gas to come mow your lawn, even though you've been paying him to do it for the last month. Then, a few months later, your lawn guy comes to your house with the police, and demands you pay him more than the agreed upon 20 bucks because your lawn is slightly more technical than the other houses he mows and he doesn't really want to invest in the equipment to mow it. While he could have been using the money you gave him earlier to upgrade his equipment, he instead decided to fuck you for a while. Then when push comes to shove the law gets involved and they try to get more money out of you. In a normal world you would just call another lawn guy.

t3_69wify	t1_dha4cts	1494246015	"I have no idea so I'm just going to speak in circles"  Net Neutrality is very simple.  Treat all bits the same.  That does not create a barrier to entry for any ISP.  There are far more regulations with burying lines and dealing with local governments.  Treating all bits the same is "out of the box" functionality that does not add headaches.  Conversely, removing net neutrality adds a HUGE barrier to entry for new online services.  Imagine a near future where Comcast and AT&amp;T start mandating that Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu pay them $200k a month to get back on the "fast lane". Now you want to start a new streaming service...how are you going to pony up that cash to compete?  You can't.    Net Neutrality is GOOD for small businesses, not bad.	Diknak	t1_dha45lk

Like if you have an evil person, and you give him more power, is the result typically a benevolent, changed man?  Net Neutrality only guarantees their power trip. For example, T-Mobile offers its customers free streaming of certain video and music apps to be competitive with AT&amp;T and Verizon. Under NN, this is illegal. In this case the smaller company is limited in its ability to compete. This is on top of additional costly regulations.	jsteve0	t1_dha45nu

When you hire someone to perform a service in an exponentially growing area of work then you should expect them to maintain their side and update it accordingly to stay not only current, but ward off becoming obsolete.

The problem remains, that they hold the market in their areas with monopolies, and people will be faced with the choice to be bent over and fucked for the same exact service they had before.

(T-Mobile offering free streaming for certain apps would be illegal).   The internet is one of the greatest successes of the free market. Without government oversight, just in the last 10 years the internet has advanced at exponential levels. At the first sign of trouble the FCC decided to regulate it from rules from the 1930s.

I'm not against anti-trust laws. I'm against regulating the internet under Title II.

t3_69wify	t1_dha65s2	1494249133	Yeah it's very very different. And Verizon and at&amp;t and Comcast all want this bill to pass. They own &gt;90% of the underlying fiber.

t3_69wify	t1_dha6cbk	1494249406	But ending net neutrality affects websites as much as it affects ISPs. A big part of the reason cable companies are pushing it so hard is so they can stop streaming services like Netflix from continuing to make cable obsolete.

t3_69wify	t1_dha6fn8	1494249544	1. T-Mobile is not exactly a "little guy." 2. You actually just listed an example of something that keeps monopolies in existence. Actual smaller companies cannot afford to offer free streaming services, now that this law is in effect, all these big companies can buy these free streaming services in hopes that consumers will never want to give them up.   The primary reason the cable monopolies exist is somewhat complicated, but more or less they've made franchise agreements with local municipalities. There is also the high cost of infrastructure/maintenance in getting it set up. It has nothing to do with net neutrality protections.	-viserion-	t1_dha4irg

That's the competition cable companies are facing to keep their outdated entertainment on top. Cable pretty much only has pro sports to keep themselves afloat, and as soon as the NFL realizes how much advertising money they could make with live streams, that'll be fucked too (imagine being able to watch the helmet cam of your favorite players in real time).   It's no wonder they're trying so hard to kill net neutrality. They refuse to update their model so they want the government to swoop in and save them from the free market.

On “Meet the Press” he fatuously argued that many people are still uncovered under the ACA and Trumpcare would cover them all.  Now we know why Trump was so anxious to hire Price in spite of his inside dealing on health-care investments.  The guy is happy to go on TV and lie his ass off.	SNStains	t3_69y49t

The Republican average voter has shifted so far to the right that they have very little room to actually be statesmen.  When things dont work out, it seems like Republican voters simply move farther right, and elect farther right wing reps who have even less wiggle room to get things done.   Compounded by deep red districts and gerrymandering, its a bad problem.    The senate has more of a chance, and you still see bi-partisianship. Rare though it may be.

I agree her testimony could *potentially* quash this thing and set the record straight, and could even harm Trump. But the reality is Republicans would just want the opportunity to distract from the questions that actually *need* to be asked.

t3_69yvj4	t1_dhaeoti	1494259932	There's a chance Pence gets wrapped up in the scandal himself and has to resign or be impeached. In a case like that the GOP and Democrats would essentially have to select the next President as part of entire impeachment / trial process. A consensus candidate who is a Republican would be the logical choice.   Which would explain why Kasich is sounding a lot like a Democrat lately. Bill Maher said as much. When Kasich was on Bill Maher. This looks like campaign mode to me.	xwing_n_it	t1_dhadgvm
t3_69yvj4	t1_dhaep7p	1494259944	If Trump and Pence are impeached for the Russia affair, the idea that he'd nominate his successor would be highly objectionable, since they would presumably be tainted by the misconduct that got them impeached. And assuming it happens after Democrats potentially re-take the House, they'd be in a position to block the confirmation, which has to go through both the House and Senate.  Republicans won't want President Pelosi. So what should happen at that point is a bipartisan amendment to the Presidential Succession Act providing for a special election to fill the vacancy. Under Article II, Section 1, Clauses 4 and 6 of the Constitution, Congress has authority to pass a law to do determine who becomes President when both the Presidency and Vice-Presidency are vacant. That's where most of the current line of succession comes from. There's no need to go through elaborate process to put people in positions such as Speaker or President Pro Temp of the Senate so they can, in turn, ascend to the Presidency under the current law. Congress can and should simply change the law.	The-Autarkh	t1_dhadgvm
t3_69yp0u	t1_dhaerso	1494260026	POTUS is an asshole. Let's not switch the topic to him and his problems. I agree with you on that for sure.

Trump wouldn't have broken 50% and there would have been a brokered convention. Possibly, someone else could have stolen the momentum and gotten a plurality of delegates.

t3_69yp0u	t1_dhaf1ny	1494260337	Yes, probably is. And still, because of her outside role during the transition and because the president (as crazy as he is) accussed her of possible impropriety she should tell her side of the story on record to remove all doubts and any confusion about what she did at the time. She gave 2 extensive interviews about this to cable TV. Why not repeat her story under oath and on record? This is to her and Democrats' benefit to get the story out.	ItchyThunder	t1_dhade0o

It just seems so weird to me that the people who wanted to "drain the swamp" and to "Make American Great Again" so easily fell for the same old tactics.

He has never worked any kind of job outside of politics. The closest he came was working as a conservative talk-show host. He has zero understanding of anything outside of government and works pretty much only in the theoretical. He's a technocrat of sorts but his beliefs have almost no basis in reality. I constantly run into other Republicans who have these same fallacies at heart.

t3_69zk5p	t1_dhak6mt	1494266053	You're not wrong.  &gt; Soon after taking office as Georgia Secretary of State, Handel began a project to purge voter rolls. By 2008, more than 50,000 registered Georgia voters had been "flagged" by state officials because of computer mismatches in personal identity information, forcing them to prove their eligibility. Some eligible voters were told that they were "non-citizens" although in fact they were citizens. The project raised fears about voter suppression, and was the subject of a federal lawsuit by the ACLU of Georgia and MALDEF, which accused Handel's office of engaging in a "systematic purging procedure" expressly barred by federal law within 90 days of an elections. In 2009, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division ordered a halt to the state's "voter verification" effort (denying it approval under the Voting Rights Act of 1965), determining that "thousands of citizens who are in fact eligible to vote under Georgia law have been flagged" and that the "flawed" program "frequently subjects a disproportionate number of African-American, Asian and/or Hispanic voters to additional, and more importantly, erroneous burdens on the right to register to vote." This marked the first time since the 1990s that the Justice Department had denied approval to a change in Georgia election practice. Handel defended her program, asserting that it was appropriate and necessary. A federal judge in Atlanta later dismissed a lawsuit that had accused Handel's successor, Secretary of State Brian Kemp of illegally bumping Georgia voters off the state's rolls ahead of the 2016 presidential election. In the 21-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Timothy C. Batten Sr. said the state had taken a "reasonable and nondiscriminatory" approach in trying to reach voters who had not cast a ballot within the past 7 years to confirm their addresses.

In a letter sent this past Friday from Civil Rights Division Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King to Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, the DOJ informed the state that it had failed to establish that two new voter verification procedures did not have a discriminatory effect on minority voters.

t3_69zk5p	t1_dhatmw7	1494276387	Here's something she could explain to me.  First, a quote from the article quoting her:  &gt; In a fundraising email, Handel — who will face off against Democrat Jon Ossoff in June — called the ruling by U.S. District Judge Timothy Batten, a George W. Bush appointee, a “partisan attempt to change the rules… for a nakedly partisan outcome.”  How the HELL is getting people registered to vote a "partisan" thing in any way?  Shouldn't the winner of any election have the vote of most of those who live there?  I understand that this crazy woman believes that restricting the right to vote to only those who like her is a good thing (in her mind), but she obviously needs a deep lesson in representative government.

t3_69y49t	t1_dhavtjc	1494278830	&gt; So why is Senate more bi-partisan than the House?  There's a two-vote margin of error in the Senate to pass anything, and a filibuster to worry about.  So senators have a vested interest in across-the-aisle coalitions and compromise.  By contrast, the House tends to be run by the majority of the majority.  Wider party spreads dilute the power of individual House members.  This does encourage coalitions within the House (Blue Dogs, Progressives, the Congressional Black Caucus, etc).  But because the House is fairly large, and the leadership votes are so pivotal, people tend to cluster within their own party.  And the Hastert Rule, among the GOP (we don't do anything unless a majority of Republicans agree to it) has made the House far more polarized than it has been, historically.	HTownian25	t1_dhafxgk

t3_69yvj4	t1_dhaymxc	1494282269	I'm assuming there is going to be some wheeling-and-dealing involved if there is an impeachment. First off, the GOP will have to be so scared of Trump destroying the party they will be pushing for it themselves. Which means the Democrats could block it in the Senate if they don't like the replacement. Also, the GOP may not want Ryan to become the incumbent...they'll want someone who can win in 2020.   So they could eject Trump, have Pence appoint Kasich VP then eject Pence. Or the House could simply make Kasich Speaker of the House since he wouldn't even have to be a House Rep to serve in that role (which is fucking bizarre).	xwing_n_it	t1_dhag1xt

They provide hotspots and internet access services. This is not competitive nor comparative to household Internet services of your average user.  2. Great, T-Mobile, a huge telecommunications company, is slightly more competitive in the telecommunications market. Nothing to do with what we're talking about.  3.

t3_6a4wz6	t1_dhbp1ue	1494330765	President Donald Trump spent his 100th day in office in Harrisburg, costing the city about $42,000.  Mayor Eric Papenfuse said it's not fair for municipalities to have to pay that price.  "The fact that we racked up a $42,000 bill in just one day should tell you just how expensive a visit like this is," he said.  Cameron Street was shut down and police officers, firefighters and public works officials racked up a lot of overtime.  Now, Papenfuse said the city may not have the money for other projects.  "This was an unanticipated overtime expense. So it's possible that we will not be able to make it to the end of the year without having to do a reallocation," the mayor of Harrisburg said.  The mayor viewed the president's rally at the farm show complex more as a campaign visit.  "This was clearly a campaign rally. It was the campaign which hired the farm show and organized it. And they have resources, and they have resources that they could be using to reimburse cities like Harrisburg," he said.  The issue is not just a problem in the state capital.  "There's a sort of path all over the country of municipalities that have spent thousands and thousands of dollars and are waiting to be reimbursed," he said.  Papenfuse said the city has not been reimbursed by any campaigns, including the Hillary Clinton rallies in the summer, and it's a bipartisan issue.  He's hoping the city will get at least some of the money back.  "We put together the invoice, we sent the invoice on to the campaign and it is up to them to pay. We will certainly follow up," he said.	mortin124	t3_6a4wz6

t3_6a57hi	t1_dhbteey	1494337778	You're saying that primarying Manchin is a bad idea, and by extension should not be done. You're reasoning why Democracy should be circumvented, to what ends? More power for a particular party? Let's forget the tenets of having the people choose their politician because it might hurt a particular party. This coming from people who accused (rightly so) the Republicans of putting party before country.	MagicComa106	t1_dhbt1lb
t3_6a57hi	t1_dhbtf6c	1494337806	There was a political science study that basically showed that democrats believe the electorate leans more to the right on a majority of issues, but in reality is a bit closer to the left. That's basically how people think about Manchin. Everyone thinks WV is crazy conservative. But in reality they're probably closer to the left than people want to admit. And Bernie proved that in the primary.	6heismans	t1_dhbst51

t3_6a57hi	t1_dhbtgvv	1494337869	&gt;I still fail to see the problem. If the electorate is as conservative as you people suggest, why would he have to move left? Wouldn't his opponent be done pretty quickly?  No because the democratic primary electorate is far to the left of the general electorate.  &gt;And god forbid the most conservative democrats has to make a few concessions to the left.  If it costs that democrat the election, then yes. Remember even conservative dems vote with the rest of the dems the majority of the time and they help get "progressives" like Sanders and Warren on key committee assignments.

Except for every single poll that had her crushing Trump. We'll just conveniently ignore those.  &gt;The entire primary was stacked against Bernie from the top, which they are now arguing in court they had every right to do  1. Don't they? Primaries are just to *influence* the nomination, not decide it.   2. Bernie's never been a democrat and then he suddenly puts a (D) next to his name and shows up for a primary he can't possibly win. Regardless of his politics, this is enough of a reason for the "establishment" to hate him. If you were having elections for your local anime club leadership, wouldn't you be pissed if some rando showed up and started talking using up all the resources you had built up for the election?   1. It's common for the "establishment" to push news coverage of their preferred candidate. They did the same thing for Hillary in 2008 and shocking, but Obama won the nomination because he's actually able to build coalitions and compromise, you know politics.  3. And come on, HRC treated Bernie with kid gloves to avoid alienating his supporters. Not a peep about the rape essay, Sandinistas, Castro, the USSR, nuclear waste...I know you all don't care about that but a for the majority of this country the words "socialist" and "communist" are anathema.  &gt;and were told that the independents that support Bernie will not support Hillary. They then got pissy and butthurt when that's exactly what happened.  How could independents back Bernie over Hillary if he wasn't a candidate in the general election?  &gt;Your "more electable" goddess was everything trump wanted and you were all for it.  Such projection  &gt;Your love for trump runs deep and you know it.  I'm pretty sure I'm eminently qualified to speak on my like or dislike for Trump. In fact I'd venture to say (I'm really putting myself out on a limb, I know) that I'm the **most** qualified person to speak on my political preferences.

Not to mention less stressed people are healthier.  Then there is one hospital that's trialing free food fora group of obese diabetics. It costs them $1k / month to feed these people but the estimated healthcare cost savings is many times that (based on changes in their a1c).  So free healthcare and free food and fiscally conservative in these cases.   The GOP is a domestic terrorist group masquerading as a political party, purely trying to serve the interests of the ultra rich while the rest of us 99% gets fucked slightly, but in every way imaginable.

t3_6a67y0	t1_dhc0jcp	1494346112	So we've been shitting on mayor based on the headline, which makes it sound like the mayor wants to punish white people for drinking diet soda. It's more complicated than that.  &gt; The Mayor claimed the tax would bring $16 million in revenue that would be spent on education programs aimed at reducing disparities between the city’s white students and students of color.  &gt; But the mayor has updated the plan after the staff of the mayor’s office told him that the tax would actually disproportionately fall on poor minorities, who have higher rates of soda consumption than white residents.  &gt; Murray changed the bill, lowering the levy to 1.75 cents per ounce and included diet drinks because they are by favored by affluent white city residents, despite the fact that most diet drinks have no calories and therefore don’t contribute to obesity.   SO: while we all laugh about the crazy liberals, let's actually lay this out. Seattle wants to address real racial inequities in public education, but cannot do so through tax schemes progressive enough to accomplish that goal.  Ergo, soda tax. Which is a regressive tax on account of poor people and black people drinking more soda. Hence, the DIET SODA TAX, which merely makes a super-regressive tax *slightly less regressive*.	katamario	t3_6a67y0

t3_6a6ahi	t1_dhc276e	1494347953	I was very concerned about him yesterday, thinking my faith in Graham was misplaced. After some thought, I'm pretty sure this was clever misdirection.   It seems likely that the WaPo leak came directly from the WH. Finding out who the leaker is is bad for Trump and on the off chance it's not, what harm has been done, really?

t3_6a6ahi	t1_dhc408h	1494349934	Yeah but by simply saying they need to be looked at gives emphasis that some think his businesses are shady af and that they should be looked at.  And it most definitely will make TrumpleFlakes^^TM mad so that is surely a positive.	Risley	t1_dhc2h3u

Yeah, that's what I thought. Empty noise from another one of the God Emperor's wheedling lickspittles. He hasn't done shit, he's not doing shit, and he won't do shit. Graham will wring his kerchief, flutter his fingers, and daclayuh until the cows come home but when push comes to shove, he'll fold like a cheap suit.   "But I stood up to Trump!" is what he'll trot out during election time.   "You did *nothing*," people should reply. "Talk was cheap. You did nothing because you're just another drone in the war to put party over country. Fuck. Right. Off."	Ximitar	t3_6a6ahi

t3_6a6ahi	t1_dhc48d4	1494350180	Which is pretty funny, seeing as the best way to do that would have been following through on his fretful murmurs since last year.

t3_6a6ahi	t1_dhc4ks0	1494350549	It's no secret that Graham despises Trump. He towed the party line with his questioning, but he's been pushing for the investigation to expand and go forward.

t3_6a6ahi	t1_dhc5kkf	1494351616	To be fair to Graham, this must have been a really tough decision to come to:   On one hand the entire world is nervous, our national security is at stake, our reputation as a country has been demeaned, our moral high ground has been eroded on the national stage, the constitution is under attack from frequent and outrageous executive orders, Neo-Nazis help run the white house, hate groups are recruiting and their crimes are rising, our democracy has been directly tampered with by a foreign government, our government is horribly understaffed, the shared climate of all of humanity is slowly becoming too toxic for our species to survive.  On the other hand: he might get some sideways looks from members of his own party.  So there is a lot to consider for him as he is obviously in a difficult position and we should applaud him for coming to this difficult decision on his own time.	tokyoburns	t3_6a6ahi

t3_6a6ahi	t1_dhc5sga	1494351850	How much of that is going on right now in the GOP?  How many Republicans don't like Trump, but have to tow the party line? Because they fear the party turning against them. Or Russia has something on them? Or maybe both?   I gotta wonder, myself. We call some of them spineless, but one only attacks a man of great power through great discretion. And whatever else we think of him, Trump is a man of great power right now. How many are biding their time...waiting for the right moment to drop the boom?  Unlikely, I know. But it's a pleasant thought, no?	justh81	t1_dhc4ks0

My OP specifically said "outside the event and on the roads leading to it."  &gt; Just the additional policing and security for that event.   Events don't exist in a vacuum, people live near them, other businesses operate in the area, all groups that need to have city services delivered to them. Additionally, the massive crowds / traffic for such an event don't exist in a vacuum. Backups and delays worsened by lack of police direction is going to disturb people living in the area.	dannothemanno	t1_dhc5b2v
t3_6a6kyq	t1_dhc5ufi	1494351909	Hillary lost to Obama.   Hillary did not want to lose again   Hillary went to Tim Kaine and asked if he would step down as head of DNC in return for an opportunity to become vice president when she runs again in 2016  Tim Kaine agreed, and named Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, to be his replacement.   Hillary spends the next 8 years sitting down with the DNC superdelegates and finessed them into pledging their support to her.   A year before the 2016 election primaries even begin, all ~500 superdelegates openly announce their support for HRC.   The first day of the primary, before a single person anywhere in the country cast a single vote, CNN/MSNBC/FOX are showing bar graphs with Bernie Sanders at 0 delegates, and Hillary at 500+, to give voters the illusion that the game has already been decided before it has even began.   Then enter the various delegate fuckry at the conventions, the Donna Brazile debacle, Gabbard stepping down because she found DWS was not going to give Sanders as legitimate chance, DWS getting caught being shady, refusing to step down until after the convention, then literally the next day rejoining the Hillary campaign, and on and on.   Yeah dude it was clear that the DNC was completely rigged before the election even started, regardless of who was going to be running against Hillary.	Scolopendra_Heros	t1_dhc4y8i

I worked in accounts Payable for over 20 years, and even in the most efficient and generous departments a 30 day pay is the best you see; and that's ASSUMING they have some internal contact who has the ability to create the internal documents, knows about the expense to request, and then can authorize payment!   But, *if you actually read it, it's THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN THAT SHORTED THEM*:  Papenfuse said the city has not been reimbursed by any campaigns, including the Hillary Clinton rallies in the summer, and it's a bipartisan issue.  He's hoping the city will get at least some of the money back.  "We put together the invoice, we sent the invoice on to the campaign and it is up to them to pay. We will certainly follow up," he said.   Do y'all actually READ what you post up? 😒	Sdl5	t1_dhbp1ue

t3_6a6zx5	t1_dhc71sa	1494353220	&gt;could try to launch a rival to Fox News  This might be... good? Fox has no real competitors in its space. The far-right has Brietbart and Alex Jones.  The regular right has Fox.  A Fox competitor might be able to avoid a race to the bottom that'll scare away conservatives unwilling to go full-Brietbart and they might end up being checks on each other's bullshit.  "Fox said y, its false" Sinclair  "Sinclair said x, its false" Fox  These guys think they've got it all figured out, but their lies are easily called out. A conservative network gunning for Fox could be disasterous for both of them.  Also this may be why Murdoch's kids are firing all these old talent. They know a competitor would wipe up bullshitters like O'Reilly or use him as a symbol of Fox's dishonest and perversion.	Smallmammal	t3_6a6zx5

They've said they won't pursue classified information because it will "slow them down" aka they want to get ahead of the other committees for all the sweet press by skipping security clearance.  It's a clever move to get good press for themselves, but I'll be impressed only after they start to uncover something we didn't already know, which seems unlikely if not impossible if they're going to skip security clearance.

t3_6a6ahi	t1_dhc76ob	1494353370	&gt;He went on and on about records of the agency and who could do it and needing a trail.  That's literally part of his job as a senator, oversight of the other two branches, and he's focusing on it because section 702 is coming up for re-authorization. As someone who will vote on that re-authorization, I don't think its a bad thing for him to get some facts and make an informed decision, or to ensure that there is proper accountability when the government incidentally spies on it's own citizens.

t3_6a6ahi	t1_dhc782d	1494353414	To be fair, Graham is the only one who has been using his committee to actually hold hearings in the last 2 months.  In the game of, "what have you done for me lately?" he's the only GOP person I don't hate.	jrakosi	t1_dhc416y

It stinks from the Oval Office to the press office, and you don’t have to stop at the counsel’s office to check on the stench.

Not when they're openly advocating for future disaster that will unemploy millions, cause mass homelessness and economic catastrophe across America, and end up like last time, siphoning billions from the poorest of us into the pockets of the richest.  These men and women running the country have been entrusted by the lowliest among us to lead our nation away from these exact things they're advocating for.  They are truly awful people unfit to govern a chicken coop.	Plisskens_snake	t1_dhccazq

t3_6a78kk	t1_dhcgymo	1494364295	Your comments seem to be based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the process to obtain and hold a security clearance and what a security clearance actually is. The president doesn't strip people of security clearances and even if he did, it certainly wouldnt be done to a prominent member of his successors transition team.   All of this is semantics though since Trump knew Flynn's background and hired him anyways. Pretty inexcusable but I appreciate the cartwheels your doing to justify why it isnt Trumps fault.

t3_6a3e4c	t1_dhckpah	1494368562	Sorry for your anecdote.  For every one you have, I have an instance where I've debated one and had a reasonable conversation. Despite my own feelings about it, we were both able to keep a clear head and not act on our hate for each other's decisions. I've even managed to do it a little at work, without punitive action taken against me (in fact, I've recently earned a bonus).  If anything, I hear of liberals flipping out, and I've had my own step mother do it to me for my vote in 2012. I've flipped out too a little myself, but only online, still I'm ashamed of every instance.  In any case, I reject the assertion that most Trump supporters throw tantrums at disagreement in a free country such as ours.	howitzer86	t1_dhc8w1g
t3_6a6ahi	t1_dhcku46	1494368712	That is the correct answer.   As president he shoudln't be quoted as saying shame on me. He should of thought of that before the quoted phrase, but at least he remembered half way through.   Bush the person isn't half terrible, Bush the presidental puppet, was a shill.

t3_6a78kk	t1_dhcl09r	1494368902	So you are a Bernie Sanders supporter who doesn't know about any of this shit?   Bernie's campaign was busted [breaching and copying Clinton's voter data](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/documents-show-sanders-staffers-accessed-clinton-voter-data/story?id=35846799)  [600+ pages of illegal donations](http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/847/201605100300045847/201605100300045847.pdf) (and that wasn't the only FEC letter, just the longest)  Bernie [used campaign funds to fund a trip to Rome for him and his family](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bernie-sanders-brings-family-trip-vatican/story?id=38416805)   &gt;Seems like a typical Hillary thing to try and claw at one's own supporters, even if it means losing the race. This makes two times she's done that now...  I have no idea what that is even supposed to mean. If you are trying to imply Hillary faulted by clawing at people who otherwise would have been supporters, I think you may have missed Sanders shitting on the Democratic party the entire race (and for decades before that). But how is *my* comment Hillary clawing at anyone? ... never mind I have no idea what the fuck you mean by that.	ReallySeriouslyNow	t1_dhcjsst
t3_6a78kk	t1_dhcl7hp	1494369130	Let me guess, the amount of donations they received had a bunch they had to turn back, and Hillary's campaign team used Bernie's visit to the Vatican to claim that he, a jew with a good enough amount of wealth, was using campaign funds to have a "vacation" there.   Come on, do you really think people fall for this? This is why you lost, buckaroo. Limp-dicked attacks.	AlternativeFactCheck	t1_dhcl09r
t3_6a78kk	t1_dhcmdi1	1494370484	So, all that stuff was just "shitting on Bernie" and a false attack when you naively believed it wasn't done by Sanders.

t3_6a78kk	t1_dhcmv93	1494371066	600+ pages of illegal donations? Highly misleading. The first guy takes up nearly five pages alone because he kept donating small amounts. Do you think Bernie personally called him and told him to do that?  You're saying no one donated over the $2,700 limit to Hillary? And if they did, it's Hillary's fault?  Most likely the guy just did not know about the donation limit, or did not realize he had gone over it (see how most of his donations were $1)  Hell, even Shia Labeouf is on that list. He donated $6,015.  Compare that to just one of Hillary's Victory Fund dinners loaded with cash from special interests. Boom.	LesenW	t1_dhcl09r
t3_6a6ahi	t1_dhcnbnb	1494371621	At the hearing, in between Senator Cornyn and Durbin, Graham snuck in a question about whether or not section 702 covered foreign agents residing in the United States. Clapper responded that it did.	donaldtrumpstact	t3_6a6ahi
t3_6a78kk	t1_dhco2bq	1494372527	&gt;600+ pages of illegal donations? Highly misleading.  It's literally a 600+ page document listing violating donations. And it's not the only one. There are hundreds of pages more in other F.E.C. letters to the Sanders campaign.  &gt;You're saying no one donated over the $2,700 limit to Hillary? And if they did, it's Hillary's fault?  Your reading comprehension is terrible. I'm saying had that letter been sent to Hillary, people would have flipped their shit. *You* would have flipped your shit if you found out the F.E.C. sent Hillary a 639 page letter detailing illegal over the limit and foreign donations her campaign received. I mean, Saudis donated to Hillary's husband's charity years before the election, and people were freaking out about it and equating it to Hillary's campaign taking foreign donations. Sanders had pages and pages of foreign donations *during the campaign* and his supporters didn't give a shit, despite their crying about Hillary.    &gt;Most likely the guy just did not know about the donation limit, or did not realize he had gone over it (see how most of his donations were $1)  "the guy"? Dude, it's a 639 page document. There are a lot of fucking people, not just one guy making a bunch of $1 donations. And since so many of the people with small donations frequently made multiple tiny donations in a single days multiple days in a row, I guess now we know how Bernie's supporters partially manufactured his low donation average.   &gt;Hell, even Shia Labeouf is on that list. He donated $6,015   Which is illegal. I'm sure you would have the same dismissive attitude about Hillary's celebrity donors going over the legal limit.	ReallySeriouslyNow	t1_dhcmv93
t3_6a3e4c	t1_dhcpuzk	1494374754	&gt; In any case, I reject the assertion that most Trump supporters throw tantrums at disagreement in a free country such as ours.

t3_6a78kk	t1_dhdfr6l	1494422479	&gt; I'm sure you would have the same dismissive attitude about Hillary's celebrity donors going over the legal limit.  I don't, because Bernie gave the money back as required while Hillary played loopholes to get money and keep it. There's a difference here.  I'm not sure how you expect Bernie to stop Shia Lebeouf from donating to him online, but he sure didn't collect the money anyways to skirt through the spirit of the law using a "Bernie Victory Fund".    With 600+ pages, it looks like you're talking a few hundred donors, at most. Bernie Sanders had millions of donors, not really sure how its his fault a fraction of a percent tried to donate more than the limit. If he wanted to be near-illicit, again, he would have used the victory fund.	LesenW	t1_dhco2bq
t3_6a4wz6	t1_dhe2y6i	1494447990	Yeah, it is kinda a poor area.  A large section of the city is state capitol, which doesn't pay taxes to the city. Then there is the poorer urban areas, which don't make a lot of money for the city because it is based on property values, a lot of industries don't really base themselves out of harrisburg city anymore either.   but on top of that, this was an unplanned expense.  That means the city has already gotten and allocated their money, meaning that money has to come from somewhere.	thenewtbaron	t1_dhc3xuy
